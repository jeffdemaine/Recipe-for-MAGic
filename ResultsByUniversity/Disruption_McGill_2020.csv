For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 1 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (80 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to  hours, then 60 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within  days.We enrolled 8 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (71 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (4 of 4 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (5 of 4 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was -2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 2.2; P = 0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported.After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.

The building blocks, the α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, form protofilaments that associate laterally into the hollow microtubule. Microtubule also exists as highly stable doublet microtubules in the cilia where stability is needed for ciliary beating and function. The doublet microtubule maintains its stability through interactions at its inner and outer junctions where its A- and B-tubules meet. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, bioinformatics and mass spectrometry of the doublets of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Tetrahymena thermophila, we identified two new inner junction proteins, FAP276 and FAP106, and an inner junction-associated protein, FAP126, thus presenting the complete answer to the inner junction identity and localization.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from  January to 3 April 2020, using subject headings or subheadings combined with text words for the concepts of covid-19 and serological tests for covid-19. Eligibility criteria and data analysis Eligible studies measured sensitivity or specificity, or both of a covid-19 serological test compared with a reference standard of viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Studies were excluded with fewer than five participants or samples. Risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies  (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using random effects bivariate meta-analyses. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was overall sensitivity and specificity, stratified by method of serological testing (enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs)) and immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgM, or both). Secondary outcomes were stratum specific sensitivity and specificity within subgroups defined by study or participant characteristics, including time since symptom onset. Results 501 references were identified and 4 studies included. 4 risk of bias assessments were carried out (one for each population and method evaluated). High risk of patient selection bias was found in 98% (48/49) of assessments and high or unclear risk of bias from performance or interpretation of the serological test in 73% (36/49). Only 10% (4/40) of studies included outpatients. Only two studies evaluated tests at the point of care. For each method of testing, pooled sensitivity and specificity were not associated with the immunoglobulin class measured. The pooled sensitivity of ELISAs measuring IgG or IgM was 84.3% (95% confidence interval 75.6% to 90.9%), of LFIAs was 66.0% (49.3% to 79.3%), and of CLIAs was 97.8% (46.2% to 100%). In all analyses, pooled sensitivity was lower for LFIAs, the potential point-of-care method. Pooled specificities ranged from 96.6% to 99.7%. Of the samples used for estimating specificity, 83% (10 465/12 547) were from populations tested before the epidemic or not suspected of having covid-19. Among LFIAs, pooled sensitivity of commercial kits (65.0%, 49.0% to 78.2%) was lower than that of non-commercial tests (88.2%, 83.6% to 91.3%). Heterogeneity was seen in all analyses. Sensitivity was higher at least three weeks after symptom onset (ranging from 69.9% to 98.9%) compared with within the first week (from 13.4% to 50.3%). Conclusion Higher quality clinical studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for covid-19 are urgently needed.

Recently, the security vulnerability of DL algorithms to adversarial samples has been widely recognized. The fabricated samples can lead to various misbehaviors of the DL models while being perceived as benign by humans. Successful implementations of adversarial attacks in real physical-world scenarios further demonstrate their practicality. Hence, adversarial attack and defense techniques have attracted increasing attention from both machine learning and security communities and have become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we first introduce the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of adversarial attack techniques. We then describe a few research efforts on the defense techniques, which cover the broad frontier in the field.

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels.",2020-09-11,Molecular therapy.

For diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), however, monitoring all the focal lesions visible on MRI sequences, even very small ones, is essential for disease staging, prognosis, and evaluating treatment efficacy. Small lesion segmentation presents significant challenges to popular deep learning models. This, coupled with their deterministic predictions, hinders their clinical adoption. Uncertainty estimates for these predictions would permit subsequent revision by clinicians. We present the first exploration of multiple uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) in the context of deep networks for lesion detection and segmentation in medical images. Specifically, we develop a 3D MS lesion segmentation CNN, augmented to provide four different voxel-based uncertainty measures based on MC dropout. We train the network on a proprietary, large-scale, multi-site, multi-scanner, clinical MS dataset, and compute lesion-wise uncertainties by accumulating evidence from voxel-wise uncertainties within detected lesions. We analyze the performance of voxel-based segmentation and lesion-level detection by choosing operating points based on the uncertainty. Uncertainty filtering improves both voxel and lesion-wise TPR and FDR on remaining, certain predictions compared to sigmoid-based TPR/FDR curves.

How are shared habits, norms, and expectations learned and maintained with precision and reliability across large-scale sociocultural ensembles? Is there a unifying account of the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of culture? Notions such as “shared expectations,” the “selective patterning of attention and behaviour,” “cultural evolution,” “cultural inheritance,” and “implicit learning” are the main candidates to underpin a unifying account of cognition and the acquisition of culture; however, their interactions require greater specification and clarification. In this article, we integrate these candidates using the variational (free-energy) approach to human cognition and culture in theoretical neuroscience. We describe the construction by humans of social niches that afford epistemic resources called cultural affordances. We argue that human agents learn the shared habits, norms, and expectations of their culture through immersive participation in patterned cultural practices that selectively pattern attention and behaviour. We call this process “thinking through other minds” (TTOM) – in effect, the process of inferring other agents’ expectations about the world and how to behave in social context.

We demonstrate that, through ATP-dependent RNA binding, the DEAD-box protein eIF4A reduces RNA condensation in vitro and limits stress granule formation in cells. This defines a function for eIF4A to limit intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in cells.

This novel disease entity often prompts comparisons with, and extrapolation of treatment approaches from, primary autoimmune disorders. Accordingly, current treatment guidelines for irAEs make generic recommendations adapted from the literature describing primary autoimmune diseases, without taking into consideration the substantial disparity of the immunohistopathological findings within each organ affected by an irAE. The treatment modalities themselves are complex and have many potential drawbacks, such as serious and rarely fatal infections, drug toxicities overlapping with irAEs and the risk of compromising cancer immune surveillance. Herein, we provide an overview of key cellular and soluble immunological factors mediating irAEs and propose a model integrating this knowledge with the immunohistopathological findings of the affected organs for a personalized decision-making process for each patient.

Objective To investigate the contributions of relapse-associated worsening vs relapse-independent progression to overall confirmed disability accumulation (CDA) and assess respective baseline prognostic factors and outcomes of 2 treatments. Design, Setting, and Participants Analyses occurred from July 201 to February 202 on pooled data from the intention-to-treat population of 2 identical, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group randomized clinical trials (OPERA I and II) conducted between August 201 and April 2015. In the trials, patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), diagnosed using the 201 revised McDonald criteria, were randomized from 30 trial sites in 5 countries; resulting data were analyzed in the pooled data set. Interventions Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg of ocrelizumab by intravenous infusion every  weeks or subcutaneous interferon β-1a  times a week at a dose of  μg throughout a 96-week treatment period. Main Outcomes and Measures Confirmed disability accumulation was defined by an increase in  or more of  measures (Expanded Disability Status Scale, timed 25-ft walk, or 9-hole peg test), confirmed after  or  months, and classified per temporal association with confirmed clinical relapses (PIRA or RAW). Results In the pooled OPERA I and II population (165 of 20 eligible participants), baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar for patients randomized to interferon β-1a vs ocrelizumab (mean [SD] age, 37. [9.2] vs 37. [9.2] years; 5 [66.6%] vs 5 women [65.4%]). After 9 weeks, 12-week composite CDA had occurred in 22 (29.6% by Kaplan-Meier estimate) randomized to interferon β-1a and 16 (21.1%) randomized to ocrelizumab; 24-week composite CDA had occurred in 17 (22.7%) taking interferon β-1a and 12 (16.2%) taking ocrelizumab. The PIRA events were the main contributors to 12-week and 24-week composite CDA after 9 weeks in patients treated with interferon β-1a (17 of 22 [78.0%] and 1 of 17 [80.6%], respectively) and ocrelizumab (14 of 16 [88.0%] and 1 of 12 [89.1%], respectively); a minority had CDA explained by RAW events (6 of 39 [17.7%] and  of 29 [17.4%], respectively). Very few patients with composite CDA experienced both RAW and PIRA events (1 of 39 [4.4%] for 12-week and  of 29 [5.0%] for 24-week composite CDA). Ocrelizumab (vs interferon β-1a) was associated with reduced risk of composite CDA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67) and confirmed PIRA (HR, 0.78) and RAW (HR, 0.47) events. Conclusions and Relevance Most disability accumulation in RMS is not associated with overt relapses. This indicates an underlying progression in this typical RMS population and challenges the current clinical distinction of relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab was superior to interferon β-1a in preventing both RAW and PIRA.

Although degradations of TC and OTC were enhanced by increasing H2O2 and Fe2+ within the ranges investigated (H2O2 = 20-50 mg/L and Fe = 1-10 mg/L) under UV irradiation, further experiments for the photo-Fenton process were conducted with 2 mg/L of H2O2 and  mg/L of Fe2+ to balance efficiency and cost. The photo-Fenton process (UV/H2O2/Fe2+) was shown to be more effective to remove TC and OTC than H2O2, ultraviolet (UV), and UV/H2O2 at the same doses of oxidants. Inorganic anions and cations were shown to inhibit the degradation of TC and OTC during the photo-Fenton process, in the following order: HPO42- > HCO3- ≫ SO42- > Cl- and Cu2+ ≫ Ca2+ > Na+. The TC and OTC degradation are generally improved by increasing pH, which is opposite to the kpCBA,obs values, caused by increasing the deprotonation degree of TC and OTC. Four and nine transformation products of TC and OTC, respectively, were detected over the treatment period. Among the transformation products, m/z 443.14 (C22H22N2O8) formed during TC degradation, and m/z 433.16 (C20H20N2O9) and m/z 415.15 (C20H18N2O8) formed during OTC degradation, were reported for the first time. Vibrio fischeri toxicity assessment indicated that the inhibition ratio was decreased with a decreasing TC concentration, while, OTC transformation lead to higher toxicity. The product (m/z 477.15b) was determined to be the compound causing toxicity during degradation of OTC by using the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR).

To acquire the latest research trends, this study first summarizes the limitations of earlier reviews: seldom present comprehensive review for the entire data-driven process for building energy prediction and rarely summarize the input updating strategies when applying the trained data-driven model to multi-step energy prediction. To overcome these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review on building energy prediction, covering the entire data-driven process that includes feature engineering, potential data-driven models and expected outputs. The distribution of 105 papers, which focus on building energy prediction by data-driven approaches, are reviewed over data source, feature types, model utilization and prediction outputs.

Here we present a large-n analysis of 2743 cases that sheds light on the characteristics of environmental conflicts and the environmental defenders involved, as well as on successful mobilization strategies. We find that bottom-up mobilizations for more sustainable and socially just uses of the environment occur worldwide across all income groups, testifying to the global existence of various forms of grassroots environmentalism as a promising force for sustainability. Environmental defenders are frequently members of vulnerable groups who employ largely non-violent protest forms. In 11% of cases globally, they contributed to halt environmentally destructive and socially conflictive projects, defending the environment and livelihoods. Combining strategies of preventive mobilization, protest diversification and litigation can increase this success rate significantly to up to 27%. However, defenders face globally also high rates of criminalization (20% of cases), physical violence (18%), and assassinations (13%), which significantly increase when Indigenous people are involved.

In order to predict two water quality variables, namely dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; µg/L) in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece, two standalone deep learning (DL) models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, along with their hybrid, the CNN–LSTM model, were developed. The main novelty of this study was to build a coupled CNN–LSTM model to predict water quality variables. Two traditional machine learning models, support-vector regression (SVR) and decision tree (DT), were also developed to compare with the DL models. Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, specifically pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (°C), electrical conductivity (EC; µS/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 201 to May 31, 201 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t − 1) and two (t − 2) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively.

Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN–LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a.

Biodegradability, renewability, strong mechanical properties, tunable aspect ratio, and low density offer tremendous possibilities for the use of cellulose in various fields. Owing to the high number of reactive groups (i.e., hydroxyl groups) on the cellulose surface, it can be readily functionalized with various functional groups, such as aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and amines, leading to diverse properties. In addition, the ease of surface modification of cellulose expands the range of compounds which can be grafted onto its structure, such as proteins, polymers, metal nanoparticles, and antibiotics. There are many studies in which cellulose nano-/microfibrils and nanocrystals are used as a support for antibacterial agents. However, little is known about the relationship between cellulose chemical surface modification and its antibacterial activity or biocompatibility. In this study, we have summarized various techniques for surface modifications of cellulose nanostructures and its derivatives along with their antibacterial and biocompatibility behavior to develop non-leaching and durable antibacterial materials.

Lepack et al. found that, with cocaine exposure, there is an intracellular accumulation of dopamine in neurons of a brain region called the ventral tegmental area (see the Perspective by Girault). Dopamine associates with chromatin to initiate a previously unknown form of epigenetic regulation called dopaminylation.

Means to reduce aflatoxin incidence in crops were also presented, with an emphasis on the environmentally-friendly technology using atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus. Aflatoxins are unavoidable widespread natural contaminants of foods and feeds with serious impacts on health, agricultural and livestock productivity, and food safety. They are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus species distributed on three main sections of the genus (section Flavi, section Ochraceorosei, and section Nidulantes). Poor economic status of a country exacerbates the risk and the extent of crop contamination due to faulty storage conditions that are usually suitable for mold growth and mycotoxin production: temperature of 2 to 2 °C and water activity of 0.90 to 0.99. This situation paralleled the prevalence of high liver cancer and the occasional acute aflatoxicosis episodes that have been associated with these regions. Risk assessment studies revealed that Southeast Asian (SEA) and Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries remain at high risk and that, apart from the regulatory standards revision to be more restrictive, other actions to prevent or decontaminate crops are to be taken for adequate public health protection. Indeed, a review of publications on the incidence of aflatoxins in selected foods and feeds from countries whose crops are classically known for their highest contamination with aflatoxins, reveals that despite the intensive efforts made to reduce such an incidence, there has been no clear tendency, with the possible exception of South Africa, towards sustained improvements. Nonetheless, a global risk assessment of the new situation regarding crop contamination with aflatoxins by international organizations with the required expertise is suggested to appraise where we stand presently.",2020-02-13,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,https://openalex.org/V15239247,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041215,1215,1215,17,4,1,74,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997763290,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041215,journal-article,2997763290

We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain – variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference – what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control – the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies – and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.",2020-08-01,Adaptive Behavior,https://openalex.org/V183337005,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1059712319862774,225,239,28,4,1,73,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2953421850,https://doi.org/10.1177/1059712319862774,journal-article,2953421850

Studies on bilingualism account for individual differences with measures such as L2 age of acquisition, exposure, or language proficiency, but recent theoretical perspectives posit that the relative balance between the two or more languages throughout daily life (i.e., interactional context ) is a crucial determinant for language representation, access, and control. We propose an innovative measure to characterize this construct by using entropy to estimate the social diversity of language use. Language entropy is computed from commonly-collected language history data and generalizes to multilingual communicative contexts. We show how language entropy relates to other indices of bilingual experience and that it predicts self-report L2 outcome measures over and above classic measures of language experience. Thus, we proffer language entropy as a means to characterize individual differences in bilingual (and multilingual) language experience related to the social diversity of language use.",2020-03-01,Bilingualism: Language and Cognition,https://openalex.org/V24095051,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1366728919000026,283,294,23,2,1,70,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2919408379,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1366728919000026,journal-article,2919408379

This facilitates the spread of rumors through social networks. A rumor is a story or statement for which truthfulness has not been verified. Efficiently detecting and acting upon rumors throughout social networks is of high importance to minimizing their harmful effect. However, detecting them is not a trivial task. They belong to unseen topics or events that are not covered in the training dataset. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting breaking news rumors, instead of long-lasting rumors, that spread in social media. We propose a new approach that jointly learns word embeddings and trains a recurrent neural network with two different objectives to automatically identify rumors. The proposed strategy is simple but effective to mitigate the topic shift issues. Emerging rumors do not have to be false at the time of the detection. They can be deemed later to be true or false. However, most previous studies on rumor detection focus on long-standing rumors and assume that rumors are always false. In contrast, our experiment simulates a cross-topic emerging rumor detection scenario with a real-life rumor dataset.

Methods This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of RCTs and studies with real-world data (RWD) can combine the advantages of both to generate RWE that is fit for regulatory purposes. Results Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from RWD or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using RWD could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional RCTs for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on RCTs for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. Conclusions While RWE from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes.

We propose two novel dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a randomized crossover trial comparing a rapid insulin-alone artificial pancreas with rapid insulin-and-pramlintide and with regular insulin-and-pramlintide artificial pancreas systems in adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants were assigned to the interventions in random order during three 24-h inpatient visits. Each visit was preceded by an outpatient hormonal open-loop run-in period of 10–14 days. The dual-hormone artificial pancreas delivered pramlintide in a basal-bolus manner, using a novel dosing algorithm, with a fixed ratio relative to insulin. The primary outcome was time in the range 3.9–10.0 mmol/L. RESULTS Compared with the rapid insulin-alone artificial pancreas system, the rapid insulin-and-pramlintide system increased the time in range from 74% (SD 18%) to 84% (13%) (P = 0.0014), whereas the regular insulin-and-pramlintide system did not change the time in range (69% [19%]; P = 0.22). The increased time in range with the rapid insulin-and-pramlintide system was due to improved daytime control (daytime time in range increased from 63% [23%] to 78% [16%], P = 0.0004). There were 1 (1 per 2. days) hypoglycemic events (&amp;lt;3.3 mmol/L with symptoms or &amp;lt;3.0 mmol/L irrespective of symptoms) with the rapid insulin-alone system, compared with 1 (1 per 2. days) and 1 (1 per 1.4 days) with the rapid and regular insulin-and-pramlintide systems, respectively.

Touted as a solution to the last mile problem, a multitude of micro-mobility companies have situated themselves in urban centers promising low cost alternative transportation options for short, urban travel. The rapid arrival of these companies, however, has left little time for city officials, transportation planners, and citizens to assess the demand for these services and compare them to existing transportation options. In this work, we investigate two key aspects of these micro-mobility services. First, we identify the spatial and temporal differences between these mobility companies and highlight the nuanced differences in usage patterns. Second, we compare these new services to an existing mode of transportation, namely automobile-based ride-hailing, with regards to differences in travel time within a city. The results of these analyses indicate that while many micro-mobility companies are spatiotemporally similar, there are notable differences in where and when these services are used. Similarly, we find that automobile travel is not always the fastest means of transportation within an urban setting. During periods of heavy traffic congestion, e.g., rush hour, micro-mobility services offer a faster means of travel within the city.

However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices.

The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) framework was used to classify prescribed antibiotics. We identified 4 studies from 2 LMICs, mostly conducted in the public sector and in urban areas, and predominantly based on medical records abstraction and/or drug prescription audits. The pooled prevalence proportion of antibiotic prescribing was 52% (95% CI: 51%-53%), with a prediction interval of 44%-60%. Individual studies' estimates were consistent across settings. Only  studies assessed rationality, and the proportion of inappropriate prescription among patients with various conditions ranged from 8% to 100%. Among  studies in  countries that reported details on prescribed antibiotics, Access-group antibiotics accounted for more than 60% of the total in  countries. The interpretation of pooled estimates is limited by the considerable between-study heterogeneity. Also, most of the available studies suffer from methodological issues and report insufficient details to assess appropriateness of prescription.Antibiotics are highly prescribed in primary care across LMICs. Although a subset of studies reported a high proportion of inappropriate use, the true extent could not be assessed due to methodological limitations. Yet, our findings highlight the need for urgent action to improve prescription practices, starting from the integration of WHO treatment recommendations and the AWaRe classification into national guidelines.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019123269.",2020-06-16,PLOS Medicine,https://openalex.org/V197939330,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003139,e1003139,e1003139,17,6,1,57,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035568588,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003139,journal-article,3035568588

Using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) scans of 331 participants, we obtained functional 3-dimensional (3-D) independent component spatial maps for use as features in classification and regression tasks. A 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was developed for the classification task. MMSE scores were predicted using: linear least square regression (LLSR), support vector regression, bagging-based ensemble regression, and tree regression with group independent component analysis (gICA) features. To improve MMSE regression performance, we applied feature optimization methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The mean balanced test accuracy was 85.27% for the classification of AD versus healthy controls. The medial visual, default mode, dorsal attention, executive, and auditory related networks were mainly associated with AD. The maximum clinical MMSE score prediction accuracy with the LLSR method applied on gICA combined with SVM-RFE features had the lowest root mean square error (3.27 ± 0.58) and the highest R2 value (0.63 ± 0.02). Classification of AD and healthy controls can be successfully achieved using only rs-fMRI and MMSE scores can be accurately predicted using functional independent component features. In the absence of trained clinicians, AD disease status and clinical MMSE scores can be jointly predicted using 3-D deep learning and regression learning approaches with rs-fMRI data.",2020-01-01,Neuroinformatics,https://openalex.org/V3444786,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-019-09419-w,71,86,18,1,0,56,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2945434083,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-019-09419-w,journal-article,2945434083

We conditionally deleted MORs from neurons in two key areas of the brainstem respiratory circuitry (the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC)) to determine their role in opioid-induced respiratory disturbances in adult, awake mice. Deletion of MORs from KF neurons attenuated respiratory rate depression at all doses of morphine. Deletion of MORs from preBotC neurons attenuated rate depression at the low dose, but had no effect on rate following high doses of morphine. Instead, high doses of morphine increased the occurrence of apnoeas. The results indicate that opioids affect distributed key areas of the respiratory network in a dose-dependent manner and countering the respiratory effects of high dose opioids via the KF may be an effective approach to combat overdose. Abstract The primary cause of death from opioid overdose is respiratory failure. High doses of opioids cause severe rate depression and increased risk of fatal apnoea, which correlate with increasing irregularities in breathing pattern. µ-Opioid receptors (MORs) are widely distributed throughout the brainstem respiratory network, but the mechanisms underlying respiratory depression are poorly understood. The medullary pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) and the pontine Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) are considered critical for inducing opioid-related respiratory disturbances. We used a conditional knockout approach to investigate the roles and relative contribution of MORs in KF and preBotC neurons in opioid-induced respiratory depression in awake adult mice. The results revealed dose-dependent and region-specific opioid effects on the control of both respiratory rate and pattern. Respiratory depression induced by an anti-nociceptive dose of morphine was significantly attenuated following deletion of MORs from either the KF or the preBotC, suggesting cumulative network effects on respiratory rate control at low opioid doses. Deletion of MORs from KF neurons also relieved rate depression at near-maximal respiratory depressant doses of morphine. Meanwhile, deletion of MORs from the preBotC had no effect on rate following administration of high doses of morphine. Instead, a severe ataxic breathing pattern emerged with many apnoeas. We conclude that opioids affect distributed areas of the respiratory network and opioid-induced respiratory depression cannot be attributed to only one area in isolation. However, countering the effects of near maximal respiratory depressant doses of opioids in the KF may be a powerful approach to combat opioid overdose.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278612,189,205,598,1,1,56,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980219486,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278612,journal-article,2980219486

To reduce the negative effects of the accelerating use of RFT, China has recently been committed to promote green RFT. Efforts made in this direction have mainly focused on supply-side policy and technical measures, while neglecting the importance of demand-side psychological and behavioral strategies. Recent research suggests that drivers play a fundamental role in generating environmental impacts during transport. Thus, the success of green RFT should also be based on a thorough understanding of the drivers’ environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior. In this study, we investigate the current levels of environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior among China’s RFT drivers, and explore the role of environmental awareness as defined by four main components—environmental concern, environmental attitude, environmental knowledge, and behavioral intention—in motivating pro-environmental RFT behavior. We also test the moderating effect of perceived policy effectiveness on the awareness–behavior relationship. Hypotheses are examined using a sample of 243 truck drivers with structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate the existence of an environmental awareness–behavior gap. We determine that the awareness score (3.2) is higher than the behavior score (3.1) because barriers to pro-environmental behavior are stronger than motivators. We also find that environmental concern, attitude, and knowledge indirectly affect pro-environmental behavior via behavioral intention. Moreover, a high level of perceived policy effectiveness facilitates the transformation of awareness into behavior, bridging the awareness–behavior gap. Our study confirms the importance of environmental awareness and effective incentive policies in encouraging pro-environmental RFT behavior. The conclusions will aid researchers’ understanding of drivers’ environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior in China’s RFT, and compel transport policy makers and managers to implement more effective measures that promote environmentally sustainable RFT.",2020-04-10,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119796,119796,119796,252,,0,56,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995758450,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119796,journal-article,2995758450

However, we report varying probabilities of unexpected germline recombination in distinct Cre driver lines designed for nervous system-specific recombination. Selective maternal or paternal germline recombination is showcased with sample Cre lines. Collated data reveal germline recombination in over half of 64 commonly used Cre driver lines, in most cases with a parental sex bias related to Cre expression in sperm or oocytes. Slight differences among Cre driver lines utilizing common transcriptional control elements affect germline recombination rates. Specific target loci demonstrated differential recombination; thus, reporters are not reliable proxies for another locus of interest.

By incorporating this prior knowledge, the proposed framework not only accelerates the learning process, but also gets a better fuel economy, thus making the energy management system relatively stable.

Although much has been learned about the factors that promote and hinder rates of organic carbon degradation in natural systems, the controls on the distribution of organic carbon in modern and ancient sediments are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize how recent findings are changing entrenched perspectives on organic matter degradation in marine sediments: a shift from a structurally-based chemical reactivity viewpoint towards an emerging acceptance of the role of the ecosystem in organic matter degradation rates. That is, organic carbon has a range of reactivities determined by not only the nature of the organic compounds, but by the biological, geochemical, and physical attributes of its environment. This shift in mindset has gradually come about due to a greater diversity of sample sites, the molecular revolution in biology, discoveries concerning the extent and limits of life, advances in quantitative modeling, investigations of ocean carbon cycling under a variety of extreme paleo-conditions (e.g. greenhouse environments, euxinic/anoxic oceans), the application of novel analytical techniques and interdisciplinary efforts.

Futhermore, this model generalizes to an external set of tissue samples from prenatal human hippocampi. We examine variation in this specific gene expression pattern across the whole brain, finding a distinct anterioventral-posteriodorsal gradient.

Despite biochemical and structural advances, a fundamental contradiction has persisted in the current understanding of insulin ligand–receptor interactions. While biochemistry predicts two distinct insulin binding sites, 1 and 2, recent structural analyses have resolved only site 1. Using a combined approach of cryo-EM and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we present the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin molecules. Complementing the previously described insulin–site 1 interaction, we present the first view of insulin bound to the discrete insulin receptor site 2. Insulin binding stabilizes the receptor ectodomain in a T-shaped conformation wherein the membrane-proximal domains converge and contact each other. These findings expand the current models of insulin binding to its receptor and of its regulation. In summary, we provide the structural basis for a comprehensive description of ligand–receptor interactions that ultimately will inform new approaches to structure-based drug design.",2020-01-06,Journal of Cell Biology,https://openalex.org/V96410829,The Rockefeller University Press,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201907210,,,219,1,1,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982943795,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201907210,journal-article,2982943795

Among a variety of synthetic and natural macromolecular systems, chitosan, an abundant biopolymer, offers a platform for tailored architectures that could have high loading capacity of cargo, target and deliver. Stimuli directed accumulation of vehicles and drug release is an area of direct relevance to biomedical applications. In this review, we highlight essential characteristics of modified chitosan that present themselves for efficient response through an internal (glutathione, reactive oxygen species, pH, temperature, enzymes, and chemical/electrical potential gradient), and external stimuli (ultrasound, light, mechanical stimuli, magnetic and electrical fields).

When the cell-specific role of IL-17RA signaling was examined, the development of HCC was decreased in both alcohol-fed Il-17raΔMΦ and Il-17raΔHep mice devoid of IL-17RA in myeloid cells and hepatocytes, but not in Il-17raΔHSC mice (deficient in IL-17RA in hepatic stellate cells). Deletion of Il-17ra in myeloid cells ameliorated tumorigenesis via suppression of pro-tumorigenic/inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic responses in alcohol-fed Il-17raΔMΦ mice. Remarkably, despite a normal inflammatory response, alcohol-fed Il-17raΔHep mice developed the fewest tumors (compared with Il-17raΔMΦ mice), with reduced steatosis and fibrosis. Steatotic IL-17RA-deficient hepatocytes downregulated the expression of Cxcl1 and other chemokines, exhibited a striking defect in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/TNF receptor 1-dependent caspase-2-SREBP1/2-DHCR7-mediated cholesterol synthesis, and upregulated the production of antioxidant vitamin D3. The pharmacological blocking of IL-17A/Th-17 cells using anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibodies suppressed the progression of HCC (by 70%) in alcohol-fed mice, indicating that targeting IL-17 signaling might provide novel strategies for the treatment of alcohol-induced HCC.Overall, IL-17A is a tumor-promoting cytokine, which critically regulates alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC.IL-17A is a tumor-promoting cytokine, which critically regulates inflammatory responses in macrophages (Kupffer cells and bone-marrow-derived monocytes) and cholesterol synthesis in steatotic hepatocytes in an experimental model of alcohol-induced HCC.

Previous research indicated that large polyethylene microbeads were abundant in the freshwater sediments of the St. Lawrence River. Here we extend this work by quantifying the abundance of a broad range of sizes and types of microplastics in sediments and surface water samples, and we relate these metrics to environmental variables. We sampled 2 sites for sediments that spanned a land use gradient, and 1 surface water stations above and below wastewater effluent sites, along the fluvial corridor of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City from July to August 2017. Microplastics were removed from sediments using an oil extraction protocol and enumerated under fluorescent microscopy. We tested predictions that environmental filters and known point sources affect microplastic concentrations in the river. The mean concentration of microplastics across all sediment sampling sites was 83 (±150 SE) plastics per kg dry weight (range 65-7562 plastics per kg dry weight), which is among the highest recorded (in the top 25%) for the world's freshwater and marine systems. Microplastic concentrations in the sediments were significantly related to a suite of environmental variables including land use and sediment particle characteristics. Particle characteristics, proximity to point sources (urban land use), and environmental filters (sediment compositional variables, % organic carbon, % inorganic carbon and distance from shore) each explained a significant fraction of variation in the microplastic composition in the sediment, with environmental filters having the greatest influence.

In this theory, the nonlinear terms in all the kinematic parameters are kept. By applying the conditions of zero transverse normal and shear stresses at the top and bottom surfaces of shells, a third-order thickness and shear deformation theory with six kinematic parameters is derived. This is a particularly interesting result since the developed theory presents a single additional parameter to describe the thickness deformation with respect to the popular Reddy’s third-order shear deformation theory, which has five parameters. The accuracy of the proposed six-parameter theory is tested for static and dynamic benchmark cases.

The dysregulation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes may cause cancer, a consequence of cell-intrinsic and/or cell-extrinsic events. Cellular DNA can be damaged by spontaneous hydrolysis, reactive oxygen species, aberrant cellular metabolism or other perturbations that cause DNA damage. Moreover, several environmental factors may damage the DNA, alter cellular metabolism or affect the ability of cells to interact with their microenvironment. While some environmental factors are well established as carcinogens, there remains a large knowledge gap of others owing to the difficulty in identifying them because of the typically long interval between carcinogen exposure and cancer diagnosis. DNA damage increases in cells harbouring mutations that impair their ability to correctly repair the DNA. Tumour predisposition syndromes in which cancers arise at an accelerated rate and in different organs - the equivalent of a sensitized background - provide a unique opportunity to examine how gene-environment interactions influence cancer risk when the initiating genetic defect responsible for malignancy is known.

Levels of heme oxygenase-1 and α-synuclein were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, medication exposure, disease duration, and relevant comorbidities.Log-transformed expression levels of miR-153 and miR-22 were significantly decreased in the saliva of human PD patients in comparison with nonneurological controls.

A successful CoP creates and shares knowledge in the context of a specific practice toward the development of expertise. CoPs' collaborative nature, based on the co-creation of practical solutions to daily problems, aligns well with the goals of applying best practices in health professions education and training new faculty members. In our article, we share 12 tips for implementing a community of practice for faculty development. The tips were based on a comprehensive literature review and the authors' experiences.",2020-02-01,Medical Teacher,https://openalex.org/V135934248,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2018.1552782,143,149,42,2,1,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2913616384,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2018.1552782,journal-article,2913616384

Genes such as GBA and LRRK2, which harbor some of the most common mutations associated with PD, have essential roles in the ALP. α-synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene, is degraded mainly by the ALP, and mutations/multiplications in SNCA may lead to impairment of chaperone mediated autophagy or other ALP functions. Numerous other PD-related genes, such as PRKN, PINK1, TMEM175, SMPD1, CTSD, CTSB and many more, have also been reported to have important roles in the ALP. Understanding the relationship between ALP impairment and PD pathogenesis may be crucial for uncovering the mechanisms underlying PD, and for the development of long-awaited neuroprotective therapies. In this review, we will discuss the data linking the ALP to PD (other, atypical forms of Parkinsonism, will not be discussed in this review). We will focus on evidence from studies on specific genes and proteins, their roles in the ALP, and the potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of these genes in PD.",2020-04-01,Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,https://openalex.org/V147691530,Elsevier,https://zenodo.org/record/3911360,,,,,1,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984058577,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2019.11.015,journal-article,2984058577

To maximize the positive effects of training while avoiding injuries, athletes and coaches need to determine safe activity levels. The International Olympic Committee has recommended using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) to monitor injury risk and has provided thresholds to minimize risk when designing training programs. However, there are several limitations to the ACWR and how it has been analyzed which impact the validity of current recommendations and should discourage its use. This review aims to discuss previously published and novel challenges with the ACWR, and strategies to improve current analytical methods. In the first part of this review, we discuss challenges inherent to the ACWR. We explain why using a ratio to represent changes in activity may not always be appropriate. We also show that using exponentially weighted moving averages to calculate the ACWR results in an initial load problem, and discuss their inapplicability to sports where athletes taper their activity. In the second part, we discuss challenges with how the ACWR has been implemented. We cover problems with discretization, sparse data, bias in injured athletes, unmeasured and time-varying confounding, and application to subsequent injuries. In the third part, conditional on well-conceived study design, we discuss alternative causal-inference based analytical strategies that may avoid major flaws in studies on changes in activity and injury occurrence.",2020-03-03,Sports Medicine,https://openalex.org/V137994755,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-020-01280-1,1243,1254,50,7,0,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009319803,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-020-01280-1,journal-article,3009319803

It offers a standardized measure of segmentation accuracy which has proven useful. However, it offers diminishing insight when the number of objects is unknown, such as in white matter lesion segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We present a refinement for finer grained parsing of SDI results in situations where the number of objects is unknown. We explore these ideas with two case studies showing what can be learned from our two presented studies. Our first study explores an inter-rater comparison, showing that smaller lesions cannot be reliably identified. In our second case study, we demonstrate fusing multiple MS lesion segmentation algorithms based on the insights into the algorithms provided by our analysis to generate a segmentation that exhibits improved performance.

Secondary outcome was longitudinal lung function. All analyses were adjusted for demographics and standard COPD risk factors (primary and secondhand tobacco smoke exposures, occupational and environmental pollutants, and asthma).In the MESA Lung sample (mean [SD] age, 6 years [ years]; 133 women [52.7%]), 2 of 2531 participants (9.4%) had prevalent COPD, the mean (SD) airway to lung ratio was 0.03 (0.004), and the mean (SD) FEV1 decline was -33 mL/y (3 mL/y). Of 22 MESA Lung participants without prevalent COPD,  (4.3%) had incident COPD at a median of 6.2 years. Compared with participants in the highest quartile of airway to lung ratio, those in the lowest had a significantly higher COPD incidence (9.8 vs 1. cases per 100 person-years; rate ratio [RR], 8.12; 95% CI, 3.8 to 17.27; rate difference, 8.6 cases per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 7.1 to 9.2; P < .001) but no significant difference in FEV1 decline (-3 vs -33 mL/y; difference, 2 mL/y; 95% CI, - to 5; P = .30). Among CanCOLD participants (mean [SD] age,  years [1 years]; 5 women [44.3%]), 1 of 7 (15.0%) had incident COPD at a median of 3. years and the mean (SD) FEV1 decline was -36 mL/y (7 mL/y).

Current methods for converting lignocellulosics into valuable products are inefficient and expensive due to the complexity of the feedstock. By looking to nature, however, these expensive and complex processes may be consolidated into a simple, cheap, and environmentally benign process. The findings of this review demonstrate that the diversity of filamentous fungi is such that each step of the biorefining process may be catalyzed by a number of different species. While no single microorganism may catalyze all the process steps, by combining certain strains and targeting multiple products, the complete valorization of biomass may be achieved.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify studies that investigated the relationship between T2D and VFs. Cohorts providing individual participant data (IPD) were also included. Estimates from published summary data and IPD cohorts were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with T2D and VFs. RESULTS Across 1 studies comprising 852,705 men and women, individuals with T2D had lower risk of prevalent (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% CI 0.74–0.95]; I2 = 0.0%; Phet = 0.54) but increased risk of incident VFs (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.27–1.44]; I2 = 0.6%; Phet = 0.43). In the IPD cohorts (N = 19,820), risk of nonvertebral fractures was higher in those with both T2D and VFs compared with those without T2D or VFs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% CI 1.86–3.15]) or with VFs (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.32–2.27]) or T2D (HR 1.9 [95% CI 1.46–2.59]) alone. Individuals with both T2D and VFs had increased mortality compared with individuals without T2D and VFs (HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.72–2.59]) or with VFs alone (HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.49–2.28]) and borderline increased compared with individuals with T2D alone (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.99–1.52]).

However, it remains an open question for how long cyclic dynamics can be self-sustained in real communities. Field observations have been restricted to a few cycle periods5-8 and experimental studies indicate that oscillations may be short-lived without external stabilizing factors9-19. Here we performed microcosm experiments with a planktonic predator-prey system and repeatedly observed oscillatory time series of unprecedented length that persisted for up to around 5 cycles or approximately 30 predator generations. The dominant type of dynamics was characterized by regular, coherent oscillations with a nearly constant predator-prey phase difference. Despite constant experimental conditions, we also observed shorter episodes of irregular, non-coherent oscillations without any significant phase relationship. However, the predator-prey system showed a strong tendency to return to the dominant dynamical regime with a defined phase relationship. A mathematical model suggests that stochasticity is probably responsible for the reversible shift from coherent to non-coherent oscillations, a notion that was supported by experiments with external forcing by pulsed nutrient supply. Our findings empirically demonstrate the potential for infinite persistence of predator and prey populations in a cyclic dynamic regime that shows resilience in the presence of stochastic events.",2020-01-01,Nature,https://openalex.org/V137773608,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1857-0,226,230,577,7789,1,39,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994774314,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1857-0,journal-article,2994774314

To date, there are 3 known ROS generators in mammalian cells, 1 of which reside inside mitochondria. Importantly, although these ROS are deleterious at high levels, controlled and temporary bursts in H2O2 production is beneficial to mammalian cells. Mammalian cells use sophisticated systems to take advantage of the second messaging properties of H2O2. This includes controlling its availability using antioxidant systems and negative feedback loops that inhibit the genesis of ROS at sites of production. At its core, ROS production depends on fuel metabolism. Therefore, desensitizing H2O2 signals would also require the temporary inhibition of fuel combustion and fluxes through metabolic pathways that promote ROS production. Additionally, this would also demand the diversion of fuels and nutrients into pathways that generate NADPH and other molecules required to maintain cellular redox buffering capacity. Therefore, fuel selection and metabolic flux plays an integral role in dictating the strength and duration of cellular redox signals. In the present review I provide an updated view on the function of protein S-glutathionylation, a ubiquitous redox sensitive modification involving the formation of a disulfide between the small molecular antioxidant glutathione and a cysteine residue, in the regulation of cellular metabolism on a global scale. To date, these concepts have mostly been reviewed at the level of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the contexts of health and disease. Careful examination of the literature revealed that glutathionylation is a temporary inhibitor of most metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid combustion, resulting in the diversion of fuels towards NADPH-producing pathways and the inhibition of ROS production. Armed with this information, I propose that protein S-glutathionylation reactions desensitize H2O2 signals emanating from catabolic pathways using a three-pronged regulatory mechanism; 1) inhibition of metabolic flux through pathways that promote ROS production, 2) diversion of metabolites towards pathways that support antioxidant defenses, and 3) direct inhibition of ROS-generating enzymes.",2020-03-07,Redox biology,https://openalex.org/V2764928002,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101472,101472,101472,32,,1,39,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009916283,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101472,journal-article,3009916283

The etiology and management of ICUAW remain uncertain. Objective To estimate the extent to which early rehabilitation interventions (early mobilization [EM] and/or neuromuscular electrical stimulation [NMES]) compared to usual care reduce the incidence of ICUAW in critically ill patients. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central and Physiotherapy Evidence Database databases from inception to May 1st, 2017. Eligibility criteria Randomized controlled trials of EM and/or NMES interventions in critically ill adults. Data extraction and data synthesis Data on the incidence of ICUAW and secondary outcomes were extracted. Both odds and risk ratios for ICUAW were pooled using the random-effects model. Results We identified 142 reports after duplicate removal. Nine studies including 84 patients (419 intervention and 42 usual care) were included in the final analysis. The interventions involved EM in five trials, NMES in three trials, and both EM and NMES in one trial. Early rehabilitation decreased the likelihood of developing ICUAW: odds ratio of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.43-0.92) in the screened population, and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.53-0.95) in the randomized population. Conclusion, implications of key findings Early rehabilitation was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing ICUAW. Our findings support early rehabilitation in the ICU.

Results reported high-intensity ultrasound processing significantly enhanced the color attributes, cloudiness, and sugars of kiwifruit juice. Further, the shear stress, apparent viscosity, storage and loss modulus was increased with the rise of processing time. However, a significant degradation in the nanostructure of water-soluble pectin and suspended particles in ultrasound treated kiwifruit juice was observed. In addition, ultrasound processing resulted in the rupture of cell wall causing the dispersion of the intracellular components into juice while higher damage in the cellular structure was observed by increasing the processing time.

Drug nanoencapsulation was performed via ionic gelation of chitosan using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as cross-linker. Nanoparticles with a size ranging between 15 and 40 nm were prepared for neat CS/TPP with a 2/1 molar ratio while their yield was directly dependent on the applied stirring rate during the preparation process. DFO at different content (20, 4 and 7 wt %) was encapsulated into these nanoparticles. We found that drug loading correlates with increasing DFO content while the entrapment efficiency has an opposite behavior due to the high solubility of DFO. Hydrogen-bonding between amino and hydroxyl groups of DFO with reactive groups of CS were detected using FT-IR spectroscopy while X-ray diffraction revealed that DFO was entrapped in amorphous form in the CS nanoparticles. DFO release is directly dependent on the content of loaded drug, while model analysis revealed that the release mechanism of DFO for the CS/TPP nanoparticles is by diffusion.

However, few studies have specifically examined how motivation and external environmental factors (e.g., institutions) affect medical students' performance with large-scale data sets. The roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement in the mechanisms that govern how motivation affects academic performance are still unclear.Objective: This study aims to advance a comprehensive understanding about the relationships between medical students' motivation, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and academic performance in a nationwide survey, taking students' demographic factors and sociocultural environments into consideration.Design: We collected data from 1930 medical students in China. We probed the relations between studying variables. We then performed structural equation model (SEM) analysis to examine the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement on the relationship between motivation and academic performance. We further carried out multiple-group SEM analyses to compare differences between males and females, and between students in key universities and colleges (KUCs) and non-key universities and colleges (NKUCs).Results: Medical students in KUCs demonstrated significantly higher intrinsic motivation, better academic performance and lower extrinsic motivation than those in NKUCs. Male students reported higher intrinsic motivation but surprisingly lower academic performance than females. The total effect of intrinsic motivation on academic performance was larger than that of extrinsic motivation. There were significant indirect effects of either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation on academic performance through learning engagement. Besides, both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation predicted self-efficacy; however, the direct effect of self-efficacy on academic performance was not significant.Conclusions: This study provided researchers with a holistic picture of students' types of motivation in relation to academic performance.

IRF8 deficiency in humans causes a severe primary immunodeficiency presenting as susceptibility to infections, complete or severe depletion of blood dendritic cells (DC) subsets, depletion of CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and reduced numbers and impaired activity of NK cells. In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), sequence variants near IRF8 are significant risk factors for multiple chronic inflammatory diseases in humans including inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and several others. Recent studies have cataloged all the genes bound by and transcriptionally activated by IRF8 in myeloid cells, either alone or in combination with other transcription factors (PU.1, IRF1, STAT1) at steady state and in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. This IRF1/IRF8 regulome comprises immune pathways such as antigen processing and presentation pathways, expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokines and chemokines, response to stimuli such as cytokine receptors, pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors, TLRs and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor signaling pathways, and small antiviral GTPases. Members of the IRF8/IRF1 regulome are over-represented amongst genes in which mutations cause primary immunodeficiencies, and are specifically enriched at GWAS loci associated with chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.

In order to fully understand this relationship, it is necessary to constrain the quantity and type of degassed magmatic volatiles, and to determine the depth of their source and the timing of eruption. Here we present direct evidence of abundant CO 2 in basaltic rocks from the end-Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), through investigation of gas exsolution bubbles preserved by melt inclusions. Our results indicate abundance of CO 2 and a mantle and/or lower-middle crustal origin for at least part of the degassed carbon. The presence of deep carbon is a key control on the emplacement mode of CAMP magmas, favouring rapid eruption pulses (a few centuries each). Our estimates suggest that the amount of CO 2 that each CAMP magmatic pulse injected into the end-Triassic atmosphere is comparable to the amount of anthropogenic emissions projected for the 2 st century.

At the molecular level, the hormonal form of vitamin D signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed throughout the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The advent of genome-wide approaches to gene expression profiling have led to the identification of numerous VDR-regulated genes implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. The molecular data infer that vitamin D signaling should boost innate immunity against pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. Vitamin D signaling also suppresses inflammatory immune responses that underlie autoimmunity and regulate allergic responses. These findings have been bolstered by clinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmunity, and allergies. Our goals here are to provide an overview of the molecular basis for immune system regulation and to survey the clinical data from pediatric populations, using randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses where possible, linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmune conditions, and allergies, and addressing the impact of supplementation on these conditions.",2020-04-27,Nutrients,https://openalex.org/V110785341,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051233,1233,1233,12,5,1,37,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018352993,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051233,journal-article,3018352993

Loss-of-function variants in KCNH2 cause long QT syndrome type 2, which is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The majority of rare KCNH2 variants, however, are likely to be benign. Objective The purpose of this study was to develop a high-throughput assay for discriminating pathogenic from benign KCNH2 variants. Methods Nonsynonymous homozygous KCNH2 variants stably expressed in Flp-In human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines were phenotyped using an automated patch-clamp platform and a cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Functional phenotyping of heterozygous KCNH2 variants stably expressed in Flp-In human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines using a bicistronic vector was performed using an automated patch-clamp platform. Results In homozygous KCNH2 variant cell lines, discrepancies between current density and cell surface expression levels measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can be explained by changes in gating properties of the variant channels. For the 3 heterozygous KCNH2 variant cell lines studied, the assay correctly predicted the ClinVar ascribed classification for 17/17 pathogenic/likely pathogenic/benign variants. Of the 1 pore-domain variants studied, 1 had a dominant-negative expression defect while the remaining  had enhanced inactivation gating, resulting in a dominant-negative phenotype.

Some have questioned the usefulness of distinguishing high-trauma fractures from low-trauma fractures. The aim of this study is to compare BMD measurements and risk of subsequent low-trauma fracture in patients with prior high- or low-trauma fractures. Using a clinical BMD registry for the province of Manitoba, Canada, we identified women and men age 40 years or older with fracture records from linked population-based healthcare data. Age- and sex-adjusted BMD Z-scores and covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident fracture were studied in relation to prior fracture status, categorized as high-trauma if associated with external injury codes and low-trauma otherwise. The study population consisted of 64,428 women and men with no prior fracture (mean age 63.7 years), 858 with prior high-trauma fractures (mean age 65.1 years), and 14,758 with prior low-trauma fractures (mean age 67.2 years). Mean Z-scores for those with any prior high-trauma fracture were significantly lower than in those without prior fracture (P < 0.001) and similar to those with prior low-trauma fracture. Median observation time for incident fractures was 8.8 years (total 729,069 person-years). Any prior high-trauma fracture was significantly associated with increased risk for incident major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) (adjusted HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08–1.59) as was prior low-trauma fracture (adjusted HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63), and there was no significant difference between the two groups (prior trauma versus low-trauma fracture P = 0.093). A similar pattern was seen when incident MOF was studied in relation to prior hip fracture or prior MOF, or when the outcome was incident hip fracture or any incident fracture.

The model fitted well the moisture ratio and the material temperature data with average relative errors of 6.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Results show that both the energy loss caused by exhaust air and the irreversibility loss of thermodynamic process decreased with increase in RH of the drying medium from 4% to 40%. Multistage relative humidity control strategy improved both the drying rate and exergy efficiency. Among the tested schemes, the three-stage RH control strategy, i.e. (1) RH of 40% for 2 h, (2) RH of 20% for 2 h and (3) RH of 4% for 3.5 h was found to be the strategy with the highest exergy efficiency (53.3%). It was almost three times higher than that for constant 4% RH values.",2020-03-01,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,https://openalex.org/V90999920,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.119231,119231,119231,149,,0,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996227573,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.119231,journal-article,2996227573

In the current study, we review these choices from the perspective of individual differences. We focus on baseline period and reference scheme (i.e., average, mastoid, current source density), as well as choices regarding where (i.e., single electrode site vs. pooling of sites), when (i.e., area, area around peak), and how (i.e., subtraction- or regression-based difference scores) to quantify ERPs. To illustrate the impact of these analytic pathways on internal consistency reliability and individual differences, we focus on the error-related negativity (ERN) and anxiety-and present data from  samples: 1st, in adults with diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); 2nd, in relation to continuous self-reported symptoms of GAD in a large community sample of female adolescents. Results generally indicated similar internal consistency and between-subjects effect sizes across all evaluated methods. Nonetheless, some patterns of variation emerged, such as that, across both data sets, difference-based ERN measures, especially with mastoid reference, yielded more robust associations with GAD diagnosis and symptoms, despite somewhat lower internal consistency. The current analyses suggest that the association between ERN and anxiety is robust across a range of commonly used methodological choices. The present study is an example of how systematic analyses of analytic strategies on measures of internal consistency and between-subjects variability could help inform individual-differences ERP research.

This article contributes to filling these gaps in qualitative research by examining the following question: What are the key methodological and philosophical considerations of leading an interpretive phenomenological study? An exploration of interpretive phenomenology’s foundations, including Heideggerian philosophy and Benner’s applications in health care, will show how the philosophical tradition can guide research methodology. The interpretive phenomenological concepts of Dasein, lived experience, existentialia, authenticity are at the core of the discussion while relevant methodological concerns include research paradigm, researcher’s stance, objective and research question, sampling and recruitment, data collection, and data analysis. A study of pediatric intensive care unit nurses’ lived experience of a major hospital transformation project will illustrate these research considerations. This methodological article is innovative in that it explicitly describes the ties between the operational elements of an interpretive phenomenological study and the philosophical tradition. This endeavor is particularly warranted, as the essence of phenomenology is to bring to light what is taken for granted, and yet phenomenological research paradoxically makes frequent assumptions concerning the philosophical underpinnings.",2020-02-20,International journal of qualitative methods,https://openalex.org/V4210182004,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1609406920907254,160940692090725,160940692090725,19,,1,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006974313,https://doi.org/10.1177/1609406920907254,journal-article,3006974313

However, in recent report, Fulghum et al. concluded that lactate is a poor fuel for mitochondrial respiration [1]. In the present study, we have followed up on these findings and conducted an independent investigation to determine if lactate can support mitochondrial bioenergetics. We demonstrate herein that lactate can fuel the bioenergetics of heart, muscle, and liver mitochondria. Lactate was just as effective as pyruvate at stimulating mitochondrial coupling efficiency. Inclusion of LDH (sodium oxamate or GSK 2837808A) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; CPI-613) inhibitors abolished respiration in mitochondria energized with lactate. Lactate also fueled mitochondrial ROS generation and was just as effective as pyruvate at stimulating H2O2 production. Additionally, lactate-induced ROS production was inhibited by both LDH and PDH inhibitors. Enzyme activity measurements conducted on permeabilized mitochondria revealed that LDH is localized in mitochondria.

The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMB Review, CINHAL Complete, PubMed, and on grey literature, for population studies identifying MetS biomarkers from metabolomics/lipidomics. Extracted data included population, design, number of subjects, sex/gender, clinical characteristics and main outcome. Data were collected regarding biological samples, analytical methods, and statistics. Metabolites were compiled by biochemical families including listings of their significant modulations. Finally, results from the different studies were compared. The search yielded 3 eligible studies (2005–2019). A first category of articles identified prevalent and incident MetS biomarkers using mainly targeted metabolomics. Even though the population characteristics were quite homogeneous, results were difficult to compare in terms of modulated metabolites because of the lack of methodological standardization. A second category, focusing on MetS components, allowed comparing more than 30 metabolites, mainly associated with the glycemic component. Finally, this review included also publications studying type  diabetes as a whole set of metabolic risks, raising the interest of reporting metabolomics/lipidomics signatures to reflect the metabolic phenotypic spectrum in systems approaches.",2020-01-20,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56909-7,,,10,1,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999180239,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56909-7,journal-article,2999180239

Making accurate imputation is critical to many applications in intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we formulate the missing data imputation problem in spatiotemporal traffic data in a low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) framework and define a novel truncated nuclear norm (TNN) on traffic tensors of location$\times$day$\times$time of day. In particular, we introduce an universal rate parameter to control the degree of truncation on all tensor modes in the proposed LRTC-TNN model, and this allows us to better characterize the hidden patterns in spatiotemporal traffic data. Based on the framework of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we present an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal solution for each variable.

The formation of the kidneys begins at week 3 and nephrogenesis continues until week 36, therefore, the kidneys and outflow tracts are susceptible to environmental risk factors that perturb development throughout gestation. Many genes have been implicated in kidney and outflow tract development, and mutations have been identified in patients with CAKUT. In severe cases of CAKUT, when the kidneys do not form, the fetus will not survive. However, in less severe cases, the baby can survive with combined kidney and outflow tract defects or they may only be identified in adulthood. In this review, we will cover the clinical presentation of CAKUT, its epidemiology, and its long-term outcomes. We will then discuss risk factors for CAKUT, including genetic and environmental contributions. Although severe CAKUT is rare, low nephron number is a much more common disorder with its effect on kidney function increasingly apparent as a person ages. Low nephron number appears to arise by the same mechanisms as CAKUT, but it differs in terms of the magnitude of the insult and the timing of when it occurs during gestation.

We investigate the causes for this different approach, and stakeholder interests and interactions that influenced EPR design and implementation, in Quebec. We also discuss how various actors have been affected by, and have responded to, Quebec’s EPR program, and provide an update on how it has fared since coming into force in 2011. We conclude with some questions for further research. Quebec’s regulation demonstrates a greater demand for and supply of support for maintaining local employment through refurbishing and reuse, and reducing the environmental impacts of products through modulated fees, both due to the regulator’s ideology and interest, and vocal stakeholders on the demand side. The Quebec case shows that jurisdictions in which local firms and employment are least affected by regulation may be the most likely to experiment with novel policy instruments. At the same time, the fact that many provisions in the regulation are facing hurdles, five years after coming into force, demonstrates the hard realities of policy making and implementation, beyond the mere passing of legislation.",2020-04-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119657,119657,119657,251,,0,32,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995318394,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119657,journal-article,2995318394

They are rarer in adults. We and others have reported that ERMS arising in the uterine cervix may harbor mutations in the gene encoding the microRNA biogenesis enzyme, DICER1, but a large series of cases has not been published. In the uterus, distinguishing ERMS from adenosarcoma can be very challenging, even for expert pathologists, and DICER1 alterations have been identified in a variable subset of uterine adenosarcomas. We hypothesized that DICER1 genetic testing may be useful in distinguishing between ERMS and adenosarcoma. We conducted a central pathology review-based study of 6 tumors initially thought to be uterine ERMS or adenosarcoma; 1 neoplasms had a consensus diagnosis of ERMS, 2 of adenosarcoma and for 18, no consensus diagnosis was reached. The median age at diagnosis was 3 years (range 2.5–69) for ERMS, 57.5 years (range 27–82) for adenosarcoma, and 65.5 years (range 32–86) for no consensus cases. In our series, the DICER1 mutation prevalence differed between the three groups: DICER1 alterations were present in 18/19 (95%) ERMS, 7/27 (26%) adenosarcomas (p < 0.001), and 4/18 (22%) no consensus cases. A germline alteration was present in 6/12 ERMS patients tested versus 0/6 adenosarcoma patients. Thus, although DICER1 mutations are near ubiquitous in uterine ERMS and are significantly less common in uterine adenosarcoma, DICER1 testing is only of value in distinguishing between the two neoplasms when a DICER1 mutation is absent, as this is helpful in excluding ERMS. On review of the clinical and radiological features of the single DICER1 wild-type cervical ERMS, this was thought most likely to be of vaginal origin. Given the significant prevalence of DICER1 germline pathogenic variants in uterine ERMS, all patients with this diagnosis should be referred to a genetics service.",2020-01-03,Modern Pathology,https://openalex.org/V33606366,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-019-0436-0,1207,1219,33,6,0,30,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998535613,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-019-0436-0,journal-article,2998535613

Here we assessed whether miR-218 in the mPFC confers resilience or susceptibility to depression-like behaviors in adult mice, using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression. We also investigated whether stress-induced variations of miR-218 expression in the mPFC can be detected in blood. We find that downregulation of miR-218 in the mPFC increases susceptibility to a single session of social defeat, whereas overexpression of miR-218 selectively in mPFC pyramidal neurons promotes resilience to CSDS and prevents stress-induced morphological alterations to those neurons. After CSDS, susceptible mice have low levels of miR-218 in blood, as compared with control or resilient groups. We show further that upregulation and downregulation of miR-218 levels specifically in the mPFC correlate with miR-218 expression in blood. Our results suggest that miR-218 in the adult mPFC might function as a molecular switch that determines susceptibility vs. resilience to chronic stress, and that stress-induced variations in mPFC levels of miR-218 could be detected in blood.

Of the many methods, titanium and/or hydroxyapatite coatings, extrusion to create surface pores, and an accelerated neutral atom beam treatment have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improve the integration of PEEK spinal cages. The success of these surface modifications brings hope for the clinical translation of other techniques in the future, but there are several limitations that may be preventing other treatments from reaching the clinic. This review describes numerous strategies that have been applied to PEEK-based implants for improving their osseointegration and enhancing their antibacterial properties. The review concludes with a discussion about future directions for the field and provides suggestions for advancing clinical translation of surface-modified PEEK implants to improve the lives of patients in need of these implants.",2020-02-01,Macromolecular Bioscience,https://openalex.org/V182383103,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201900271,1900271,1900271,20,2,0,29,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991033869,https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201900271,journal-article,2991033869

While there are many on-going discussions and studies evaluating potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining activities, these focus primarily on impacts to animal biodiversity. The microscopic spectrum of life on the seafloor and the services that this microbial realm provides in the deep sea are rarely considered explicitly. In April 2018, a community of scientists met to define the microbial ecosystem services that should be considered when assessing potential impacts of deep-sea mining, and to provide recommendations for how to evaluate these services. Here we show that the potential impacts of mining on microbial ecosystem services in the deep sea vary substantially, from minimal expected impact to complete loss of services that cannot be remedied by protected area offsets. We conclude by recommending that certain types of ecosystems should be off limits until initial characterizations can be performed, and that baseline assessments of microbial diversity, biomass, and biogeochemical function need to be considered in environmental impact assessments of all potential instances of deep-sea mining.",2020-07-01,Limnology and Oceanography,https://openalex.org/V207705515,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11403,1489,1510,65,7,1,29,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999088805,https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11403,journal-article,2999088805

The influences of operating factors, including methanol/oil molar ratio, enzyme loading, reaction time, type of alcohol, water content and reaction temperature on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. The optimized conditions to achieve maximum biodiesel yield were obtained using an enzyme loading of 3 kUnit, a methanol to oil molar ratio of 4:1, a water content of 3%, a reaction temperature of 45 °C and a 28 h reaction time. Under these optimal operating conditions, the highest biodiesel yield observed was 96.5%. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied to ensure the conversion of used cooking oil into biodiesel.

Laboratory evidence suggests that community rescue is most likely in high-biomass communities that have previously experienced moderate doses of sublethal stress. We assessed this result under more natural conditions, in a mesocosm experiment with phytoplankton communities exposed to the ubiquitous herbicide glyphosate. We tested whether community biomass and prior herbicide exposure would facilitate community rescue after severe contamination. We found that prior exposure to glyphosate was a very strong predictor of the rescue outcome, while high community biomass was not. Furthermore, although glyphosate had negative effects on diversity, it did not influence community composition significantly, suggesting a modest role for genus sorting in this rescue process.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from  January 199 to 1 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed. Eligibility criteria and data analysis Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 1 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 1 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups. Results 1 of 51 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among  8 participants with a TST induration of ≥1 mm was 0. (95% confidence interval 0. to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 1 1 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in  different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests. Conclusions The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

Screening has been proposed to improve identification and management of these disorders, but little is known about the validity of screening tools for these disorders. We conducted a systematic review of validated screening tools for detecting anxiety and PTSD in LMICs. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and PsychINFO were searched (inception-April 22, 2020). Eligible studies (1) screened for anxiety disorders and/or PTSD; (2) reported sensitivity and specificity for a given cut-off value; (3) were conducted in LMICs; and (4) compared screening results to diagnostic classifications based on a reference standard. Screening tool, cut-off, disorder, region, country, and clinical population were extracted for each study, and we assessed study quality. Accuracy results were organized based on screening tool, cut-off, and specific disorder. Accuracy estimates for the same cut-off for the same screening tool and disorder were combined via meta-analysis. Results Of 632 unique citations identified, 5 articles including 7 screening tools were included. There were 46, 1 and 1 validations for anxiety, PTSD, and combined depression and anxiety, respectively. Continentally, Asia had the most validations (35). Regionally, South Asia (11) had the most validations, followed by South Africa (10) and West Asia (9). The Kessler-10 (7) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7) (6) were the most commonly validated tools for anxiety disorders, while the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (3) and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (3) were the most commonly validated tools for PTSD. Most studies (29) had the lowest quality rating (unblinded). Due to incomplete reporting, we could meta-analyze results from only two studies, which involved the GAD-7 (cut-off ≥10, pooled sensitivity = 76%, pooled specificity = 64%). Conclusion Use of brief screening instruments can bring much needed attention and research opportunities to various at-risk LMIC populations. However, many have been validated in inadequately designed studies, precluding any general recommendation for specific tools in LMICs. Locally validated screening tools for anxiety and PTSD need further evaluation in well-designed studies to assess whether they can improve the detection and management of these common disorders.

However, Islamophobic social conditions have created numerous hardships as they attempt to integrate into European society. This situation may be especially challenging for refugees identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ). They not only experience discrimination from multiple sources but also lack connections with their diaspora communities. This qualitative study examined the experiences of LGBTQ refugees who migrated from Islamic societies to Austria (n = 19) and the Netherlands (n = 19). We conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how they experienced integration. Additionally, we interviewed five LGBTQ refugee service providers to triangulate data and enrich findings. We identified the following themes: precarious livelihoods, the complexity of depending on others, still not free, and you’re Muslim; we don’t want you. Findings indicated that participants experienced uncertainty regarding the asylum process, including issues related to the Dublin Regulation. Although participants relied on host community members to ease integration, they also encountered discrimination based on race, religion, and immigration status. In Vienna, this discrimination was experienced as overt, whereas in Amsterdam, it was subtler. Participants also encountered discrimination based on their sexual and gender identity from other refugees, compromising their ability to receive services needed to facilitate integration.

We describe an approach, pioneered in Southern Africa and tested here in a new context in Northern Europe, to developing scenarios using existing bottom-up transformative initiatives to examine plausible transitions towards positive, sustainable futures. By starting from existing, but marginal initiatives, as well as current trends, we were able to identify system characteristics that may play a key role in sustainability transitions (e.g., gender issues, inequity, governance, behavioral change) that are currently under-explored in global environmental scenarios.

Indigenous peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining, and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, IPs are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance toward polluting activities.

Most studies dealing with tape insert have been focused on straight tube. Helical coil tube, on the other hand, has been proven to have higher heat transfer than straight tube. It is of interest to combine both enhancement methods and obtain the optimum heat transfer enhancement. The main objective of this study is, therefore, to numerically investigate flow behaviour and the corresponding heat transfer in helical tube with twisted tape insert subjected to constant wall temperature. A three-dimensional computational model is developed based on conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy, and is validated against the established empirical correlations. Good agreement is achieved between the numerical prediction and the empirical correlation calculation within the considered range of Reynolds ( R e = 10 − 200 ) and Dean Numbers ( D e = 2 − 120 ). The effects of twist ratio, inlet Reynolds number and wall temperature are evaluated and discussed in the light of numerical result. It is found that adding twisted tape insert in helical heat exchanger can enhance heat transfer performance by up to four times as compared to conventional straight tube heat exchanger, at a cost of higher frictional pressure drop. Lower twisting ratio gives rise to a higher heat transfer enhancement as it promotes higher secondary flow. At low Pr (air), heat transfer enhancement ratio increases as Re is increased; however, at high Pr (water), heat transfer enhancement ratio is higher at Re 500–1000. Finally, Nu and f correlations are developed to predict heat transfer and pressure drop for practical applications.",2020-04-01,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,https://openalex.org/V90999920,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119309,,,,,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001328945,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119309,journal-article,3001328945

We also find that this modest suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the difference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and lower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy SFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower SFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR galaxies as seen in the field.

2020,2,15,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W3012355718,MGMT promoter methylation level in newly diagnosed low-grade glioma is a predictor of hypermutation at recurrence,"Abstract Background Emerging data suggest that a subset of patients with diffuse isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant low-grade glioma (LGG) who receive adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) recur with hypermutation in association with malignant progression to higher-grade tumors. It is currently unclear why some TMZ-treated LGG patients recur with hypermutation while others do not. MGMT encodes O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair protein that removes cytotoxic and potentially mutagenic lesions induced by TMZ. Here, we hypothesize that epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter methylation facilitates TMZ-induced mutagenesis in LGG patients and contributes to development of hypermutation at recurrence. Methods We utilize a quantitative deep sequencing assay to characterize MGMT promoter methylation in 10 surgical tissue specimens from initial tumors and post-treatment recurrences of 3 TMZ-treated LGG patients. We utilize methylation arrays to validate our sequencing assay, RNA sequencing to assess the relationship between methylation and gene expression, and exome sequencing to determine hypermutation status. Results Methylation level at the MGMT promoter is significantly higher in initial tumors of patients that develop hypermutation at recurrence relative to initial tumors of patients that do not (45.7% vs 34.8%, P = 0.027). Methylation level in initial tumors can predict hypermutation at recurrence in univariate models and multivariate models that incorporate patient age and molecular subtype. Conclusions These findings reveal a mechanistic basis for observed differences in patient susceptibility to TMZ-driven hypermutation. Furthermore, they establish MGMT promoter methylation level as a potential biomarker to inform clinical management of LGG patients, including monitoring and treatment decisions, by predicting risk of hypermutation at recurrence.",2020-11-26,Neuro-oncology,https://openalex.org/V106908163,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noaa059,1580,1590,22,11,1,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012355718,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noaa059,journal-article,3012355718

Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort.

All soil microbiota have the metabolic capacity for “basic” functions (e.g., respiration and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling), but only a few soil microbiota participate in “rare” functions (e.g., methanogenesis and mineralization of recalcitrant organic pollutants). The objective of this perspective paper is to use the phylogenetic niche conservatism theory as an explanation for the functional redundancy of soil microbiota. Phylogenetic niche conservatism is defined as the tendency for lineages to retain ancestral functional characteristics through evolutionary time-scales. The present-day soil microbiota is the result of a community assembly process that started when prokaryotes first appeared on Earth. For billions of years, microbiota have retained a highly conserved set of core genes that control the essential redox and biogeochemical reactions for life on Earth. These genes are passed from microbe to microbe, which contributes to functional redundancy in soil microbiota at the planetary scale. The assembly of microbial communities during soil formation is consistent with phylogenetic niche conservatism. Within a specific soil, the heterogeneous matrix provides an infinite number of sets of diverse environmental conditions, i.e., niches that lead to the divergence of microbial species. The phylogenetic niche conservatism theory predicts that two or more microbial species diverging from the same clade will have an overlap in their niches, implying that they are functionally redundant in some of their metabolic processes. The endogenous genetic factors that constrain the adaptation of individuals and, thus, populations to changing environmental conditions constitute the core process of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Furthermore, the degree of functional redundancy in a particular soil is proportional to the complexity of the considered function. We conclude with a conceptual model that identifies six patterns of functional redundancy in soil microbial communities, consistent with the phylogenetic niche conservatism theory.",2020-02-01,Pedosphere,https://openalex.org/V205679754,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1002-0160(19)60826-x,18,24,30,1,0,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996348986,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1002-0160(19)60826-x,journal-article,2996348986

Our earlier investigations have shown that occupants play a significant role in buildings’ energy consumption: It was shown that savings of up to 20% could be achieved by modifying occupant behavior thorough direct feedback and recommendations. Studying the role of occupants in building energy consumption requires an understanding of the interrelationships between climatic conditions; building characteristics; and building services and operation. This paper describes the development of a systematic procedure to provide building occupants with direct feedback and recommendations to help them take appropriate action to reduce building energy consumption. The procedure is geared toward developing a Reference Building (RB) (an energy-efficient building) for a specific given building. The RB is then compared against its given building to inform the occupants of the given building how they are using end-use loads and how they can improve them. The RB is generated using a data-mining approach, which involves clustering analysis and neural networks. The framework is based on clustering similar buildings by effects unrelated to occupant behavior. The buildings are then grouped based on their energy consumption, and those with lower consumption are combined to generate the RB. Performance evaluation is determined by comparison of a given building with an RB. This comparison provides feedback that can lead occupants to take appropriate measures (e.g., turning off unnecessary lights or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), etc.) to improve building energy performance. More accurate, scalable, and realistic results are achiveable through current methodology which is shown through comparison with existing literature.",2020-03-01,Energy,https://openalex.org/V2497375143,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.116813,116813,116813,194,,0,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998152116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.116813,journal-article,2998152116

In this study, common bean seeds were treated with ultrasound at different power (0, 18 and 360 W) and time (0, 30, 4 and 60 min) levels, before they were subjected to sprouting (24, 48, 7 and 96 h). Stress markers (H2O2, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase), activities of defense phenolic triggering enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and tyrosine ammonia-lyase), phenolic contents (total phenolic acids, total flavonoids and anthocyanins) and antioxidant capacities (DPPH, ABTS and Fe2+ scavenging) were monitored. Results showed that, ultrasound elicitation (especially 360 W, 60 min) significantly increased accumulation of stress markers at 96 h of sprouting, leading to elevated activities of defense phenolic triggering enzymes, and final accumulation of phenolics and antioxidant capacities at significant levels compared to control. Ultrasound treatment at 360 W and 60 min reduced sprouting time by 60 h, compared to control. Results from principal component analysis clearly differentiated latter stages of sprouting and high ultrasound levels from other sprouting conditions as distinct treatments for the production of phenolic-rich common bean sprouts. Overall, results from this study indicated that elicitation with ultrasound can be a green and novel approach for producing phenolic-enriched common bean sprouts as an organic nutraceutical vegetable.",2020-06-01,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,https://openalex.org/V130447213,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.104974,104974,104974,64,,1,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001537913,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.104974,journal-article,3001537913

Chemoresistance of temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapeutic agent, is a major issue in the management of patients with glioma. Alterations of alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) gene constitute one of the most prevalent genetic abnormalities in gliomas. Therefore, elucidation of the role of ATRX contributing to TMZ resistance in glioma is urgently needed. Methods: We performed the bioinformatics analysis of gene expression, and DNA methylation profiling, as well as RNA and ChIP-seq data sets. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system was used to achieve the ATRX knockout in TMZ resistant cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to investigate the role of ATRX contributing to TMZ resistance in glioma. Results: We found that ATRX expression was upregulated via DNA demethylation mediated by STAT5b/TET2 complex and strengthened DNA damage repair by stabilizing PARP1 protein in TMZ resistant cells. ATRX elicited PARP1 stabilization by the down-regulating of FADD expression via the H3K27me3 enrichment, which was dependent on ATRX/EZH2 complex in TMZ resistant cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the PARP inhibitor together with TMZ inhibited glioma growth in ATRX wild type TMZ resistant intracranial xenograft models. Conclusions: The present study further illustrated the novel mechanism of the ATRX/PARP1 axis contributing to TMZ resistance. Our results provided substantial new evidence that PARP inhibitor might be a potential adjuvant agent in overcoming ATRX mediated TMZ resistance in glioma.",2020-02-10,Theranostics,https://openalex.org/V2482500137,Ivyspring International Publisher,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32194873/,,,,,1,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006191171,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.41219,journal-article,3006191171

In September 2019, 30 yr after the First World Congress ended, a day-long, international symposium on amphibian population declines was held at the Redpath Museum of McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Symposium participants drew upon the knowledge gained over three decades of study to look ahead with fresh ideas to address this vital aspect of the global decline of biodiversity. Despite tremendous progress over the past three decades there is still much about amphibian ecology, population biology, and pathology that remains unknown. Amphibian declines have turned out to be more complex than originally expected and the result of multiple possible causes acting across landscapes, among taxa, or between populations in ways that are not at all uniform.

In the controller, an augmented model is employed to completely eliminate the tracking error due to external disturbances imposed on the quadrotor. The proposed controller is capable of improving the trade-off between feasibility and performance of the system. By approximating the control input sequence in MPC with Laguerre function, the computational burden significantly decreases and the closed-loop performance improves. In addition, a prescribed stability procedure is applied to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the quadrotor error dynamics. Besides, the proposed method improves the numerical ill-conditioning problem in solving MPC, by modifying the position of the closed-loop system poles to lie inside the unit circle. In the simulation results, two scenarios for the quadrotor tracking problem are considered.

Some argue that protected areas may also help ensure provision of ecosystem services. However, the effect of protection on ecosystem services and whether protection affects the provision of ecosystem services is known only for a few services in a few types of landscapes. We sought to fill this gap by investigating the effect of watershed protection status and land use and land cover on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. We compared the ecosystem services provided in and around streams in  watershed types: International Union for Conservation of Nature category II protected forests, unprotected forests, unprotected forests with recent timber harvesting, and unprotected areas with agriculture. We surveyed 28 streams distributed across these watershed types in Quebec, Canada, to quantify provisioning of clean water, carbon storage, recreation, wild foods, habitat quality, and terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity richness and abundance. The quantity and quality of ecosystem services and biodiversity were generally higher in sites with intact forest-whether protected or not-relative to those embedded in production landscapes with forestry or agriculture. Clean-water provision, carbon storage, habitat quality, and tree diversity were significantly higher in and around streams surrounded by forest. Recreation, wild foods, and aquatic biodiversity did not vary among watershed types. Although some services can be provided by both protected and unprotected areas, protection status may help secure the continued supply of services sensitive to changes in land use or land cover. Our findings provide needed information about the ecosystem service and biodiversity trade-offs and synergies that result from developing a watershed or from protecting it.Efectos del Uso, Cobertura y Protección del Suelo sobre los Servicios Ambientales y la Biodiversidad de Arroyos y Ríos Resumen Las áreas protegidas son una parte importante de paisajes más extensos que se usan frecuentemente para preservar la biodiversidad o las características naturales. Hay quienes argumentan que las áreas protegidas también podrían ayudar a asegurar el suministro de servicios ambientales. Sin embargo, el efecto de la protección sobre los servicios ambientales y el hecho de si la protección afecta al suministro de estos sólo se conocen para unos cuantos servicios en muy pocos tipos de paisaje. Buscamos cerrar este vacío investigando el efecto del estado de protección de las cuencas y el uso y cobertura de suelo sobre la biodiversidad y el suministro de servicios ambientales. Comparamos los servicios ambientales proporcionados en y alrededor de los arroyos en cuatro tipos de cuenca: bosques protegidos con categoría II de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza, bosques sin protección, bosques sin protección con tala reciente y áreas sin protección con actividad agrícola. Censamos 28 arroyos distribuidos a lo largo de estos tipos de cuenca en Quebec, Canadá, para cuantificar el suministro de agua limpia, secuestro de carbono, actividades recreativas, alimentos silvestres, calidad del hábitat y riqueza y abundancia de biodiversidad acuática y terrestre. La cantidad y la calidad de los servicios ambientales y de la biodiversidad fueron generalmente más altas en los sitios de bosque intacto - protegido o no - en relación con los sitios inmersos en paisajes de producción agrícola o silvícola. El suministro de agua limpia, el secuestro de carbono, la calidad del hábitat y la diversidad de árboles fueron significativamente más altos en y alrededor de los arroyos rodeados por bosque. Las actividades recreativas, los alimentos silvestres y la biodiversidad acuática no varió entre los tipos de cuenca. Aunque algunos servicios pueden ser proporcionados por áreas con o sin protección, el estado de protección puede ayudar a asegurar el suplemento continuo de servicios sensibles a los cambios en el uso en la cobertura del suelo.

Most studies aiming to make this distinction focused on older adults only and on a priori anatomical regions. Drawing on a large, multi-cohort dataset ranging from young adults (n = 468; age range 18–35 years), to older adults with intact cognition (n = 431; age range 55–90 years) and with Alzheimer’s disease (n = 5 with late mild cognitive impairment and 7 with Alzheimer’s dementia, age range 56–88 years), we investigated grey matter organization and volume differences in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. Using independent component analysis on all participants’ structural MRI, we first derived morphometric networks and extracted grey matter volume in each network. We also derived a measure of whole-brain grey matter pattern organization by correlating grey matter volume in all networks across all participants from the same cohort. We used logistic regressions and receiver operating characteristic analyses to evaluate how well grey matter volume in each network and whole-brain pattern could discriminate between ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. Because increased heterogeneity is often reported as one of the main features characterizing brain ageing, we also evaluated interindividual heterogeneity within morphometric networks and across the whole-brain organization in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, to investigate the clinical validity of the different grey matter features, we evaluated whether grey matter volume or whole-brain pattern was related to clinical progression in cognitively normal older adults. Ageing and Alzheimer’s disease contributed additive effects on grey matter volume in nearly all networks, except frontal lobe networks, where differences in grey matter were more specific to ageing. While no networks specifically discriminated Alzheimer’s disease from ageing, heterogeneity in grey matter volumes across morphometric networks and in the whole-brain grey matter pattern characterized individuals with cognitive impairments. Preservation of the whole-brain grey matter pattern was also related to lower risk of developing cognitive impairment, more so than grey matter volume. These results suggest both ageing and Alzheimer’s disease involve widespread atrophy, but that the clinical expression of Alzheimer’s disease is uniquely associated with disruption of morphometric organization.",2020-02-01,Brain,https://openalex.org/V118357697,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz414,635,649,143,2,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005165005,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz414,journal-article,3005165005

Methods Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a prospective birth cohort of 2,120 individuals followed from birth (1997/98) to age 17 years (2014/15). Cybervictimization and face-to-face victimization experienced since the beginning of the school year, as well as serious suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt were self-reported at ages 13, 15 and 17 years. Results In cross-sectional analyses at 13, 15 and 17 years, adolescents cybervictimized at least once had, respectively, 2.3 (95% CI = 1.64-3.19), 4.2 (95% CI = 3.27-5.41) and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.57-4.66) higher odds of suicidal ideation/attempt after adjusting for confounders including face-to-face victimization, prior mental health symptoms and family hardship. Sensitivity analyses suggested that cybervictimization only and both cyber- and face-to-face victimization were associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation/attempt compared to face-to-face victimization only and no victimization; however, analyses were based on small n. In prospective analyses, cybervictimization was not associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later after accounting for baseline suicidal ideation/attempt and other confounders. In contrast, face-to-face victimization was associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later in the fully adjusted model, including cybervictimization.

Ideally, an injectable implant should promote the recruitment of cells from the surrounding native tissue and allow cells to migrate freely as they generate a new extracellular matrix network. Nanocomposite hydrogels such as carbon nanotube (CNT)-loaded hydrogels have been hypothesized to promote cell recruitment and cell migration relative to unloaded ones. To investigate this, CNT-glycol chitosan hydrogels were synthesized and studied. Chemoattractant-induced cell migration was studied using a modified Boyden Chamber experiment. Migrated cells were counted using flow cytometry. Cell adhesion was inferred from the morphology of the cells via an image segmentation method. Cell migration and recruitment results confirmed that small concentrations of CNT significantly increase cell migration in hydrogels, thereby accelerating tissue regeneration and wound healing in situations where there is insufficient migration in the unloaded matrix.",2020-02-13,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59463-9,,,10,1,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005888597,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59463-9,journal-article,3005888597

Here, we investigated the multi-scale structure and composition of the mussel byssus cuticle before, during and after formation to gain insight into the processing of this hard, yet extensible metal cross-linked protein composite. Our findings reveal that the granular substructure crucial to the cuticle’s function as a wear-resistant coating of an extensible polymer fiber is pre-organized in condensed liquid phase secretory vesicles. These are phase-separated into DOPA-rich proto-granules enveloped in a sulfur-rich proto-matrix which fuses during secretion, forming the sub-structure of the cuticle. Metal ions are added subsequently in a site-specific way, with iron contained in the sulfur-rich matrix and vanadium coordinated by DOPA-catechol in the granule.

In an on-going survey to uncover new or enhanced antimicrobial metabolite-producing microbes from harsh environments, such as oil-rich niches, 123 bacterial strains were isolated from three oil batteries in the region of Chauvin, Alberta, and characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on their nucleotide sequences, the strains are associated with  phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes), as well as 1 other discrete genera that shared high homology with known sequences, with the majority of these strains identified to the species level. The most prevalent strains associated with the three oil wells belonged to the Bacillus genus. Thirty-four of the 123 strains were identified as biosurfactant-producers, among which Bacillus methylotrophicus strain OB9 exhibited the highest biosurfactant activity based on multiple screening methods and a comparative analysis with the commercially available biosurfactant, Tween 20. B. methylotrophicus OB9 was selected for further antimicrobial analysis and addition of live cultures of B. methylotrophicus OB9 (or partially purified biosurfactant fractions thereof) were highly effective on biofilm disruption in agar diffusion assays against several Gram-negative food-borne bacteria and plant pathogens. Upon co-culturing with B. methylotrophicus OB9, the number of either Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Newport SL1 or Xanthomonas campestris B07.007 cells significantly decreased after  h and were not retrieved from co-cultures following 1 h exposure. These results also translated to studies on plants, where bacterized tomato seedlings with OB9 significantly protected the tomato leaves from Salmonella enterica Newport SL1 contamination, as evidenced by a 40% reduction of log10 CFU of Salmonella/mg leaf tissue compared to non-bacterized tomato leaves. When B. methylotrophicus 0B9 was used for bacterized lettuce, the growth of X. campestris B07.007, the causal agent of bacterial leaf spot of lettuce, was completely inhibited.

The functional magnetic resonance imaging–derived global brain signal is a candidate marker for a conscious state, and thus the authors hypothesized that unconsciousness would be accompanied by a loss of global temporal coordination, with specific patterns of decoupling between local regions and global activity differentiating among various unconscious states. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging global signals were studied in physiologic, pharmacologic, and pathologic states of unconsciousness in human natural sleep (n = 9), propofol anesthesia (humans, n = 14; male rats, n = 12), and neuropathological patients (n = 21). The global signal amplitude as well as the correlation between global signal and signals of local voxels were quantified. The former reflects the net strength of global temporal coordination, and the latter yields global signal topography. Results A profound reduction of global signal amplitude was seen consistently across the various unconscious states: wakefulness (median [1st, 3rd quartile], 0.46 [0.21, 0.50]) versus non-rapid eye movement stage 3 of sleep (0.30 [0.24, 0.32]; P = 0.035), wakefulness (0.3 [0.31, 0.42]) versus general anesthesia (0.2 [0.21, 0.28]; P = 0.001), healthy controls (0.30 [0.27, 0.37]) versus unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (0.2 [0.15, 0.24]; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and low dose (0.0 [0.06, 0.08]) versus high dose of propofol (0.0 [0.03, 0.05]; P = 0.028) in rats. Furthermore, non-rapid eye movement stage 3 of sleep was characterized by a decoupling of sensory and attention networks from the global network. General anesthesia and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome were characterized by a dissociation of the majority of functional networks from the global network. This decoupling, however, was dominated by distinct neuroanatomic foci (e.g., precuneus and anterior cingulate cortices). Conclusions The global temporal coordination of various modules across the brain may distinguish the coarse-grained state of consciousness versus unconsciousness, while the relationship between the global and local signals may define the particular qualities of a particular unconscious state.

Among many sources, the multi-decade Landsat archive is certainly the best known, but legacy and current data from other sensors is available as well through the USGS data portals: these include CBERS, ASTER, and more. Though the particular band combinations or non-global missions have made their integration into analyses more challenging, these data, in conjunction with the entire Landsat record, are available to contribute to multi-decade surveys of land-cover change. With the goal of tracing forest change through time near the Roosevelt River in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, we used BULC and Google Earth Engine to fuse information from 1 space-borne imagers capturing 14 images spanning 4 years. With high accuracy, the resulting time series of classifications shows the timing and location of land-use/land-cover change—both deforestation and regrowth—at sub-annual time scales. Accuracy estimates showed that the synthesized BULC classification time series was better than nearly all of the single-day image classifications, covering the entire study area at sub-annual frequency while reducing the impact of clouds and most unwanted noise as it fused information derived from a wide array of imaging platforms. The time series improved and gradually sharpened as the density of observations increased in recent decades, when there were three or more clear, higher-resolution views of a pixel annually from any sensor combination. In addition to detailing the methodology and results of multi-source data fusion with the BULC approach, this study raises timely points about integrating information from early satellite data sources and from sensors with footprints smaller than Landsat's. There are decades of research deriving sensor-specific techniques for classifying land use and land cover from a single image in a variety of settings.

Among these are rheumatologic irAE, including inflammatory arthritis, myositis, vasculitis, and others. Rheumatologic irAE seem to be different from irAE in other organs and from traditional autoimmune diseases in that they can occur early or have delayed onset, and can persist chronically, even after cancer therapy is terminated.

The viscosity of primary and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has important implications for the processing of aqueous organic aerosol phases in the atmosphere, their involvement in climate forcing, and transboundary pollution. Here we introduce a new thermodynamics-based group-contribution model, which is capable of accurately predicting the dynamic viscosity of a mixture over several orders of magnitude (∼10-3 to &gt;1012 Pa s) as a function of temperature and mixture composition, accounting for the effect of relative humidity on aerosol water content. The mixture viscosity modelling framework builds on the thermodynamic activity coefficient model AIOMFAC (Aerosol Inorganic–Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients) for predictions of liquid mixture non-ideality, including liquid–liquid phase separation, and the calorimetric glass transition temperature model by DeRieux et al. (2018) for pure-component viscosity values of organic components. Comparing this new model with simplified modelling approaches reveals that the group-contribution method is the most accurate in predicting mixture viscosity, although accurate pure-component viscosity predictions (and associated experimental data) are key and one of the main sources of uncertainties in current models, including the model presented here. Nonetheless, we find excellent agreement between the viscosity predictions and measurements for systems in which mixture constituents have a molar mass below 350 g mol−1. As such, we demonstrate the validity of the model in quantifying mixture viscosity for aqueous binary mixtures (glycerol, citric acid, sucrose, and trehalose), aqueous multicomponent mixtures (citric acid plus sucrose and a mixture of nine dicarboxylic acids), and aqueous SOA surrogate mixtures derived from the oxidation of α-pinene, toluene, or isoprene. We also use the model to assess the expected change in SOA particle viscosity during idealized adiabatic air parcel transport from the surface to higher altitudes within the troposphere. This work demonstrates the capability and flexibility of our model in predicting the viscosity for organic mixtures of varying degrees of complexity and its applicability for modelling SOA viscosity over a wide range of temperatures and relative humidities.",2020-03-12,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,https://openalex.org/V162708223,,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2987-2020,2987,3008,20,5,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968831009,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2987-2020,journal-article,2968831009

It appears to be unknown whether there is a significant association between post–dural puncture headache and subsequent intracranial subdural hematoma. Objective To determine the association of post–dural puncture headache with postpartum intracranial subdural hematoma. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study of patients used hospital discharges recorded in the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Readmission Database for women who experienced childbirth from January 201 to December 2016. Patients were included if they had been admitted for childbirth, had 2 months of follow-up data, and did not receive a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Only the first delivery for a calendar year was studied. Data were analyzed from January 201 to June 2019. Exposures Women with post–dural puncture headache associated with neuraxial anesthesia in the 2-month postpartum period were identified usingInternational Classification of Disease(Ninth EditionandTenth Edition) codes and were compared with those without post–dural puncture headaches. Main Outcome and Measures The primary outcome was intracranial subdural hematoma in the 2-month postpartum period. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and occurrence of neurosurgery. Results A total of 26 469 771 patients with 26 498 194 deliveries were included. Exclusion of repeated deliveries (n = 28 423), deliveries without 2 months of follow-up data (n = 4 329 621), and deliveries with diagnostic lumbar puncture (n = 9334) resulted in a final cohort of 22 130 815 patients and deliveries. For the cohort, the mean (SD) age was 28.1 (6.0) years, and there were 68 374 post–dural puncture headaches, for an overall rate of 30 (95% CI, 302-316) per 100 000. There were 34 cases of subdural hematoma identified, indicating a rate of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.8) per 100 000 women. Of these, 10 cases were in women with post–dural puncture headache, indicating a rate of 14 (95% CI, 111-194) hematoma cases per 100 000 deliveries in this subgroup. Post–dural puncture headache had an unadjusted absolute risk increase of 14 (95% CI, 117-174) subdural hematoma cases per 100 000 deliveries.

Although contaminated sites are environmentally damaging, high economic costs often discourage soil remediation efforts. Phytoremediation is a potential green technology solution but can be challenging due to the diversity of anthropogenic contaminants. Co-cropping could provide improved tolerance to diverse soil challenges by taking advantage of distinct crop capabilities. Co-cropping of three species with potentially complementary functions, Festuca arundinacea, Salix miyabeana and Medicago sativa, perform well on diversely contaminated soils. Here, rhizosphere microbiomes of each crop in monoculture and in all co-cropping combinations were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing and differential abundance analysis. The hyperaccumulating F. arundinacea rhizosphere microbiome included putative plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) and metal tolerance species, such as Rhizorhapis suberifaciens, Cellvibrio fibrivorans and Pseudomonas lini. The rhizosphere microbiome of the fast-growing tree S. miyabeana included diverse taxa involved in POP degradation, including the species Phenylobacterium panacis. The well-characterised nitrogen-fixing M. sativa microbiome species, Sinorhizobium meliloti, was identified alongside others involved in nutrient acquisition and putative yet-to-be-cultured Candidatus saccharibacteria (TM7-1 group). The majority of differentially abundant rhizosphere-associated bacterial species were maintained in co-cropping pairs, with pairs having higher numbers of differentially abundant taxa than monocultures in all cases. This was not the case when all three crops were co-cropped, where most host-specific bacterial species were not detected as differentially abundant, indicating the potential for reduced rhizosphere functionality. The crops cultivated in pairs here retained rhizosphere microbiome bacteria involved in these monoculture ecosystem services of plant growth promotion, POP tolerance and degradation, and improved nutrient acquisition. These findings provide a promising outlook of the potential for complementary co-cropping strategies for phytoremediation of the multifaceted anthropogenic pollution which can disastrously affect soils around the world.",2020-04-01,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135067,135067,135067,711,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991398117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135067,journal-article,2991398117

Hence, we sought to determine the effects of NOD1 on metastasis. NOD1 expression in paired human primary colon cancer, human and murine colon cancer cells were determined using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting (WB). Clinical significance of NOD1 was assessed using TCGA survival data. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional assays, including adhesion, migration, and metastasis, was conducted to assess the effect of NOD1. C12-iE-DAP, a highly selective NOD1 ligand derived from gram-negative bacteria, was used to activate NOD1. ML130, a specific NOD1 inhibitor, was used to block C12-iE-DAP stimulation. Stable knockdown (KD) of NOD1 in human colon cancer cells (HT29) was constructed with shRNA lentiviral transduction and the functional assays were thus repeated. Lastly, the predominant signaling pathway of NOD1-activation was identified using WB and functional assays in the presence of specific kinase inhibitors. Our data demonstrate that NOD1 is highly expressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and human and murine CRC cell lines. Clinically, we demonstrate that this increased NOD1 expression negatively impacts survival in patients with CRC. Subsequently, we identify NOD1 activation by C12-iE-DAP augments CRC cell adhesion, migration and metastasis. These effects are predominantly mediated via the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.

However, the efficiency of the multi-step process required to differentiate PSCs towards pancreatic beta cells is variable between cell lines, batches and even within cultures. In adherent pancreatic differentiation protocols, we observed spontaneous local clustering of cells expressing elevated nuclear expression of pancreatic endocrine transcription factors, PDX1 and NKX6.1. Since aggregation has previously been shown to promote downstream differentiation, this local clustering may contribute to the variability in differentiation efficiencies observed within and between cultures. We therefore hypothesized that controlling and directing the spontaneous clustering process would lead to more efficient and consistent induction of pancreatic endocrine fate. Micropatterning cells in adherent microwells prompted clustering, local cell density increases, and increased nuclear accumulation of PDX1 and NKX6.1. Improved differentiation profiles were associated with distinct filamentous actin architectures, suggesting a previously overlooked role for cell-driven morphogenetic changes in supporting pancreatic differentiation. This work demonstrates that confined differentiation in cell-adhesive micropatterns may provide a facile, scalable, and more reproducible manufacturing route to drive morphogenesis and produce well-differentiated pancreatic cell clusters.",2020-01-27,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57787-0,,,,,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001352494,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57787-0,journal-article,3001352494

Despite an abundance of competing sensory stimuli, the detection of the most salient ones occurs without effort, and that detection contributes to the guidance of adaptive behavior. Neurons sensitive to the salience of visual stimuli are widespread throughout the primate visual system and are thought to shape the selection of visual targets. However, a neural source of salience remains elusive. In an attempt to identify a source of visual salience, we reversibly inactivated parietal cortex and simultaneously recorded salience signals in prefrontal cortex. Inactivation of parietal cortex not only caused pronounced and selective reductions of salience signals in prefrontal cortex but also diminished the influence of salience on visually guided behavior.

Participants self-reported peer victimization at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 17 years. Participants' behavior and family characteristics were measured repeatedly between ages 5 months and 5 years.We identified  trajectories of peer victimization from 6 to 17 years of age: low (32.9%), moderate-emerging (29.8%), childhood-limited (26.2%), and high-chronic (11.1%). Compared with children in the low peer victimization trajectory, children in the other  trajectories were more likely to exhibit externalizing behaviors in early childhood, and those in the high-chronic and moderate-emerging trajectories were more likely to be male.

Fibrillin-1 is one of the main components of microfibrils and a key player in this process. Furin processing of profibrillin-1 results in mature fibrillin-1 and releases the C-terminal propeptide as a circulating hunger hormone, asprosin. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene lead to adipose tissue dysfunction and causes Marfan syndrome, marfanoid progeroid lipodystrophy syndrome, and neonatal progeroid syndrome. Increased TGF-β signaling, altered mechanical properties and impaired adipogenesis are potential causes of adipose tissue dysfunction, mediated through deficient microfibrils. Circulating asprosin on the other hand is secreted primarily by white adipose tissue under fasting conditions and in obesity. It increases hepatic glucose production and drives insulin secretion and appetite stimulation through inter-organ cross talk. This review discusses the metabolic consequences of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-1-derived asprosin in pathological conditions. Understanding the dynamic role of fibrillin-1 in the adipose tissue milieu and of circulating asprosin in the body can provide novel mechanistic insights into how fibrillin-1 may contribute to metabolic syndrome.

However, its responsiveness to stress management remains underexplored. Meditation practice has been shown to significantly reduce stress level, among other beneficial neurophysiological outcomes. Here, we evaluated the impact of a day of intensive meditation practice (t2−t1 = 8 h) on the methylome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in experienced meditators (n = 17). In parallel, we assessed the influence of a day of leisure activities in the same environment on the methylome of matched control subjects with no meditation experience (n = 17). DNA methylation profiles were analyzed using the Illumina 450 K beadchip array. We fitted for each methylation site a linear model for multi-level experiments which adjusts the variation between t and t for baseline differences. No significant baseline differences in methylation profiles was detected between groups. In the meditation group, we identified 61 differentially methylated sites (DMS) after the intervention. These DMS were enriched in genes mostly associated with immune cell metabolism and ageing and in binding sites for several transcription factors involved in immune response and inflammation, among other functions. In the control group, no significant change in methylation level was observed after the day of leisure activities.

The common potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important staple crop with a highly heterozygous and complex tetraploid genome. The other taxa of cultivated potato contain varying ploidy levels (2X-5X), and structural variations are common in the genomes of these species, likely contributing to the diversification or agronomic traits during domestication. Increased understanding of the genomes and genomic variation will aid in the exploration of novel agronomic traits. Thus, sequencing data from twelve potato landraces, representing the four ploidy levels, were used to identify structural genomic variation compared to the two currently available reference genomes, a double monoploid potato genome and a diploid inbred clone of S. chacoense. The results of a copy number variation analysis showed that in the majority of the genomes, while the number of deletions is greater than the number of duplications, the number of duplicated genes is greater than the number of deleted ones.

A substantial portion of ROR fatalities occur in collisions with fixed objects at the roadside. Thus, this study seeks to investigate the severity of ROR crashes where elderly drivers, aged 6 years or more, hit a fixed object. The reason why the present study investigates this issue among older drivers is that, comparing to younger drivers, this age group of drivers have different psychological and physical features. Because of these differences, they are more likely to get injured in ROR types of crashes. This paper applies two types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the crashe information of California in 201 obtained from Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) database. Although the results showed that the developed ANN outperformed the hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm, the hybrid approach was more capable of predicting high-severity crashes. This is rooted in the way the hybrid model was trained by taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results also indicated that the light condition has been the most significant parameter in evaluating the level of severity associated with fixed object crashes among elderly drivers, which is followed by the existence of the right and left shoulders. Following these three contributing factors, cause of collision, Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), number of involved vehicles, age, road surface condition, and gender have been identified as the most important variables in the developed ANN, respectively.

Here we demonstrate that MS/MS fragmentation patterns can be used for the discrimination between glucose derived Schiff bases, Amadori, and Heyns compounds with glycine. An ESI-qTOF-MS system operated in the positive mode under both acidic and neutral conditions was employed to generate unique MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the molecules. Analysis of the MS data has indicated that acidic medium is suitable for generating characteristic and diagnostic ions. At high collision energy (20 eV), the spectrum of Schiff base was largely uninformative, whereas both Amadori and Heyns compounds undergo characteristic fragmentations with high diagnostic value. At low collision energy values (10eV), we observed formation of prominent diagnostic ions from the Schiff base precursor, as well as extensive dehydration reactions of all three molecules. Under acidic conditions, the diagnostic fragmentation pattern of the Amadori compound featured consecutive dehydration reactions.

Despite the success of VX-770 treatment of patients carrying at least one allele of the most common gating mutation G551D-CFTR, some lung function decline and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> colonization persist. This study aims at identifying potentiator combinations that can considerably enhance the limited channel activity of a panel of CFTR gating mutants over monotherapy. <h3>Methods</h3> The functional response of 1 CFTR mutants to single potentiators or systematic potentiator combinations was determined in the human bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o- and a subset of them was confirmed in primary human nasal epithelia (HNE). <h3>Results</h3> In six out of thirteen CFTR missense mutants the fractional plasma membrane (PM) activity, a surrogate measure of CFTR channel gating, reached only ∼10–50% of WT channel activity upon VX-770 treatment, indicating incomplete gating correction. Combinatorial potentiator profiling and cluster analysis of mutant responses to 2 diverse investigational potentiators identified several compound pairs that improved the gating activity of R352Q-, S549R-, S549N-, G551D-, and G1244E-CFTR to ∼70–120% of the WT. Similarly, the potentiator combinations were able to confer WT-like function to G551D-CFTR in patient-derived human nasal epithelia. <h3>Conclusion</h3> This study suggests that half of CF patients with missense mutations approved for VX-770 administration, could benefit from the development of dual potentiator therapy.",2020-03-01,Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,https://openalex.org/V147774598,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2019.10.011,236,244,19,2,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982641061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2019.10.011,journal-article,2982641061

The lack of understanding hinders the development and application of tissue adhesive hydrogels, particularly in the applications interfacing with repeatedly deforming tissues such as heart and lung. Here we study the interfacial fatigue fracture of a tissue adhesive hydrogel based on tough hydrogel, called tough adhesive (TA), using a fracture mechanics approach. We perform modified lap-shear tests with three types of loading (e.g., monotonic, static, and cyclic loads). We observe shakedown of the load–displacement curves during cycling and two interfacial fracture phenomena: fast debonding and interfacial fatigue fracture. We confirm the existence of a fatigue threshold (24.4 Jm−2) for the TA–skin interface, below which the interface is immune against prolonged cyclic deformation. The threshold is lower than the adhesion energy (580 Jm−2) for fast debonding. We also compare the interfacial fatigue fracture with the fatigue of bulk hydrogels.

We utilize high-resolution structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project to query hippocampus microstructure on a multivariate, voxelwise basis. Application of non-negative matrix factorization identifies spatial components (clusters of voxels sharing similar covariance patterns), as well as subject weightings (individual variance across hippocampus microstructure). By assessing the stability of spatial components as well as the accuracy of factorization, we identified 4 distinct microstructural components. Furthermore, we quantified the benefit of using multiple microstructural metrics by demonstrating that using three microstructural metrics (T1-weighted/T2-weighted signal, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) produced more stable spatial components than when assessing metrics individually. Finally, we related individual subject weightings to demographic and behavioural measures using a partial least squares analysis. Through this approach we identified interpretable relationships between hippocampus microstructure and demographic and behavioural measures. Taken together, our work suggests non-negative matrix factorization as a spatially specific analytical approach for neuroimaging studies and advocates for the use of multiple metrics for data-driven component analyses.",2020-02-15,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116348,116348,116348,207,,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988694342,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116348,journal-article,2988694342

Coatings with mixed metal powders were also sprayed to improve the deposition efficiency and coating conductivity. The results indicated a noticeable improvement in deposition efficiency related to the addition of a secondary metallic powder (aluminum, copper and zinc); this study is focused on the effect of aluminum. Following cold spray of various Sn/Al mixtures over a wide range of gas pressures, unusual coating morphologies were observed. The study of these morphologies leads to the description of two distinct deposition phases depending on the spray pressure: a direct deposition effect and an indirect deposition effect. The presence of submicron particles also supports the occurrence of a powder melting phenomenon during the process.

Study Design and Setting This was a qualitative study, triangulating data from three purposively sampled sources: (1) literature, (2) policies, and (3) interviews. Participants were corresponding authors of sampled literature (December 201 to January 2019). A critical, interpretive approach served as the analytic strategy. Results A total of 9 articles provided the sampling frame; we recruited 1 participants and sampled 2 policies. Participants labeled a wide range of personal attributes, social relationships, professional experiences, intellectual endeavors, and financial interests as “non-financial conflicts of interest.” Despite a lack of consensus regarding the nature of the problem, many “non-financial” interests are currently subject to policy action. The term serves as ethical shorthand to describe the ways that (1) “strong beliefs,” (2) “predetermined views,” (3) experiences, and (4) relationships shape evidence-led processes. Conclusion Expansion of the definition of conflict of interest to include non-financial interests may have unintended consequences, including exclusion of diverse perspectives. Problems labeled “non-financial conflicts of interest” should be defined in terms of what they are rather than what they are not (i.e., “non”-financial).

This investigation aims at assessing the tribological characteristic of some combustor components candidate cobalt-based and nickel-based superalloys. Three combinations of the alloys were tested at different operating conditions and temperatures; CP1 (Cobalt 1/Cobalt 2), CP2 (Cobalt 2/Nickel 1) and CP3 (Cobalt 1/Nickel 1). The investigation showed that the increase in temperature from 350 °C to 550 °C was associated with a decrease in the coefficient of friction for all tested contact pairs, a decrease in wear coefficient (wear damage) for CP1, and an increase in wear coefficient for CP2 and CP3. Samples analysis using SEM-EDS and Raman Spectroscopy showed that the least wear coefficient exhibited by CP1 at 550 °C, and by CP2 at 350 °C is due to the development of a compacted protective layer of chromium oxide Cr2O3, known for its favourable tribological characteristic, which contributes to load bearing, precludes the metal-metal contact, and reduces the friction and wear damage. On the other hand, the decrease in friction was associated with an increase in wear coefficient for CP2 and CP3 due to the formation of a porous oxide layer with high tungsten trioxide (WO3) content which makes the oxide softer, decreases friction and increases the wear damage in the oxide layer.

However, this influence has not been examined across income groups and in different geographic regions of varying sizes. The present study measures the relationship between accessibility and mode choice for low- and higher-income groups in eleven Canadian metropolitan regions. Our results show that the impact of accessibility on public transport mode share is stronger and non-linear for the low-income group especially in the largest metropolitan areas, where increasing accessibility past a certain optimal value will lead to a decrease in public transport mode share. However, this point occurs at the 80th percentile of existing accessibility, so improvements in mode share are nonetheless expected with improved accessibility in most areas within these regions. Moreover, in regions where an optimal value is not readily observed, improved accessibility throughout the region would lead to increased uptake of public transport for both the higher- and to a greater extent, the low-income group. Findings from this paper can be of value to transport professionals working towards meeting ridership goals around the world as comparisons between groups and across regions highlight the variation in the impacts of accessibility on mode share.",2020-03-01,Transportation Research Part D-transport and Environment,https://openalex.org/V45181156,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2020.102276,102276,102276,80,,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007453375,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2020.102276,journal-article,3007453375

Augmenting these with neurophysiological measures of the construct in question may increase the accuracy and predictive power of these assessments. Moreover, thinking about neurophysiological measures from an assessment perspective may facilitate under-utilized research approaches (e.g., brain-based recruitment of participants). However, the lack of normative data for most neurophysiological measures has prevented the comparison of individual responses to the general population, precluding these approaches. The current work examines the distributions of two event-related potentials (ERPs) commonly used in individual differences research: the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). Across three lab sites, 80 unselected participants between the ages of 1 and 3 performed the arrow version of a Flanker task while EEG was recorded. Percentile scores and distributions for ERPs on error trials, correct trials, and the difference (ΔERN, ΔPe; error minus correct) at Fz, Cz and Pz are reported. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the ΔERN at Cz were −2.37 ​μV, −5.41 ​μV, and −8.65 ​μV, respectively. The same values for ΔPe at Cz were 7.51 ​μV, 11.18 ​μV, and 15.55 ​μV. Females displayed significantly larger ΔPe magnitudes and smaller ΔERN magnitudes than males. Additionally, normative data for behavioral performance (accuracy, post-error slowing, and reaction time) on the Flanker task is reported. Results provide a means by which ERN and Pe amplitudes of young adults elicited by the arrow Flanker task can be benchmarked, facilitating the classification of neural responses as ‘large,’ ‘medium,’ or ‘small’. The ability to classify responses in this manner is a necessary step towards expanded use of these measures in assessment and research settings. These norms may not apply to ERPs elicited by other tasks, and future work should establish similar norms using other tasks.",2020-03-03,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116694,116694,116694,213,,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010210985,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116694,journal-article,3010210985

However, because active megathrust faults are difficult to observe, the causes and scales of complexity are largely unknown. Here we measured the in situ properties of the megathrust of the Middle America subduction zone in a three-dimensional seismic reflection volume to determine how fault properties vary. We quantify spatial variability in the megathrust roughness, overburden and rock physical properties. Heterogeneity in the megathrust roughness exists at length scales of a few kilometres because the megathrust is dissected by active lower-plate normal faults, which offset the megathrust and renewed fault roughness. Spatial variations in the rock physical properties at the plate interface are characterized by correlation length scales of hundreds of metres. Frontal prism taper, historical seismicity and the variation in earthquake stress drop values local to the megathrust are all affected by the heterogeneity at these length scales. Both geometric and rheological complexities may therefore control the mechanical behaviour of the subduction plate interface, which includes earthquake rupture characteristics. Geometric and rheological complexities may control the mechanical behaviour of megathrusts, according to an analysis of the heterogeneity in roughness and rock properties of the Middle America megathrust from 3D seismic reflection data.",2020-04-20,Nature Geoscience,https://openalex.org/V48977010,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-020-0562-9,369,374,13,5,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016990501,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-020-0562-9,journal-article,3016990501

Yet, little is known about how reduced PVS activation emerges across development or what implications it has for prevention. We review genetic, temperament, parenting, and naturalistic and laboratory stress research on neural measures of PVS and outline developmentally-informed models of trajectories of PVS activation. PVS function is partly heritable and appears to reflect individual differences in early-emerging temperament traits. Although lab-induced stressors blunt PVS activation, effects of parenting and naturalistic stress on PVS are mixed and depend on the type of stressor, developmental timing, and interactions amongst risk factors. We propose that there may be multiple, dynamic developmental trajectories to reduced PVS activation in which combinations of genes, temperament, and exposure to severe, prolonged, or uncontrollable stress may exert direct and interactive effects on PVS function. Critically, these risk factors may alter PVS developmental trajectories and/or PVS sensitivity to proximal stressors. Distinct factors may converge such that PVS activation proceeds along a typical, accelerated, chronically low, or stress-reactive trajectory.

Objective: The present study aimed to verify the relationship of hormonal markers and biological maturation on neuromotor abilities in young people. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with 44 female participants (11.5 ± 1.5 years). Hormones were analyzed biochemically. Skeletal and somatic maturation were analyzed using anthropometry. The muscular power of the upper and lower limbs, body speed with change of direction, and speed of the upper limbs were verified. Results: Bone age was correlated with hormonal markers (estradiol: r = 0.58; p = 0.0007), (testosterone: r = 0.51; p = 0.005). Peak growth velocity correlated with estradiol (r = 0.51; p = 0.004). The power of the lower limbs (estradiol: r = 0.52; p = 0.006; testosterone: r = 0.42; p = 0.03) and of the upper limbs (estradiol: r = 0.51; p = 0.007; testosterone: r = 0.42; p = 0.02) had a positive correlation with hormone levels and had similar results with maturation. The analysis by artificial neural networks indicated that the maturation can predict the neuromotor performance between 57.4% and 76%, while the hormonal markers showed a potential of more than 95% for the foreshadowing of the neuromotor performance of the upper limbs.

The main objective of this article is to formulate an ideational framework for the analysis of populism as it intersects with the politics of insecurity. More specifically, the article focuses on right-wing populism, turning to the framing of migrants in the United States during the Trump presidency to illustrate specific claims about the relationship between populism and the politics of insecurity. As argued, the political framing of collective threats is a central aspect of populism.

Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. METHODS Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3 years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5 years. RESULTS Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score < 20) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD. Investigating individual skill areas (e.g., fine motor and nonverbal problem-solving skills), rather than broader indices of developmental level (e.g., nonverbal IQ) may provide important cues to understanding longer-term language outcomes that can be targeted in early intervention.",2020-07-01,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V177929781,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,826,835,61,7,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969389783,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,journal-article,2969389783

The plants were grown in three naturally contaminated soils with different total Cd levels (1.57, 3.89, and 22.4 mg kg-1). Throughout the experimental period, no plants showed any visible symptoms of metal toxicity. The Cd uptake of C. argentea was the greatest in the S-YS soil (105 μg plant-1) and among the greatest in the S-HC soil and S-TJ soil. Besides, C. argentea exhibited the highest bioconcentration factor (12.3) in three soils. To improve the phytoextraction efficiency of C. argentea, we applied four low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs): tartaric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid.

One potential reason for treatment failure is the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Several cell markers, particularly CD44, have been used to isolate CSCs. However, isolating a pure population of CSC in HNSCC still remains a challenging task. Recent findings show that normal oral stem cells were isolated using CD271 as a marker. Thus, we investigated the combined use of CD271 and CD44 to isolate an enriched subpopulation of CSCs, followed by their characterization in vitro, in vivo, and in patients’ tissue samples. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting was used to isolate CD44+/CD271+ and CD44+/CD271− from two human HNSCC cell lines. Cell growth and self-renewal were measured with MTT and sphere/colony formation assays. Treatment-resistance was tested against chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) and ionizing radiation. Self-renewal, resistance, and stemness-related genes expression were measured with qRT-PCR. In vivo tumorigenicity was tested with an orthotopic immunodeficient mouse model of oral cancer. Finally, we examined the co-localization of CD44+/CD271+ in patients’ tissue samples. We found that CD271+ cells were a subpopulation of CD44+ cells in human HNSCC cell lines and tissues. CD44+/CD271+ cells exhibited higher cell proliferation, sphere/colony formation, chemo- and radio-resistance, upregulation of CSCs-related genes, and in vivo tumorigenicity when compared to CD44+/CD271− or the parental cell line.

To support the computation offloading, we propose a hybrid relaying (HR) approach employing two orthogonal frequency bands, where the amplify-and-forward scheme is used in one band to exchange computational results, while the decode-and-forward scheme is used in the other band to transfer the unprocessed tasks. The motivation behind the proposed HR scheme for RACO is to adapt the allocation of computing and communication resources both to dynamic user requirements and to diverse computational tasks. Within this framework, we seek to minimize the weighted sum of the execution delay and the energy consumption in the RACO system by jointly optimizing the computation offloading ratio, the bandwidth allocation, the processor speeds, as well as the transmit power levels of both user $A$ and the MERS, under practical constraints on the available computing and communication resources. The resultant problem is formulated as a non-differentiable and nonconvex optimization program with highly coupled constraints. By adopting a series of transformations and introducing auxiliary variables, we first convert this problem into a more tractable yet equivalent form. We then develop an efficient iterative algorithm for its solution based on the concave-convex procedure. By exploiting the special structure of this problem, we also propose a simplified algorithm based on the inexact block coordinate descent method, with reduced computational complexity.

It has important consequences for our interpersonal relationships and for navigating our social world more generally. Although research has identified numerous psychological factors that can influence empathy, evidence suggests that empathy may also be rooted in our biology and, in particular, the gonadal steroid hormone testosterone. To date, much of the research linking testosterone and empathy has focused on the 2D:4D ratio (i.e., the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers), and the results have been mixed. These mixed results, however, may be due to reliance on self-report measures to assess empathy, which can be vulnerable to self-presentation, as well as social-cultural norms about gender/sex differences in empathy. Moreover, although some have argued that digit ratio is an indicator of prenatal androgen exposure, the evidence for this to date is weak. Here, we aimed to follow up on this prior work, using a naturalistic empathic accuracy task in which participants dynamically track, in real-time, the emotional state of targets. We show that lower digit ratio (Study 1; N = 107) and higher circulating testosterone (Study 2; N = 76) are associated with poorer empathic accuracy performance; critically, these effects hold when controlling for sex/gender. In neither study, however, did we find effects on self-reported empathy.

However, potential climate change impact on GHG emissions from tile-drained fields is poorly documented. Accordingly, climate change impacts on GHG emissions, N losses to drainage and crop production in a subsurface-drained field in Southern Quebec, Canada were assessed using calibrated and validated RZWQM2 model. The RZWQM2 model was run for a historical period (1971-2000) and for a future period (2038 to 2070) using data generated from 11 different GCM-RCMs (global climate models coupled with regional climate models). Under the projected warmer and higher rainfall conditions mean drainage flow was predicted to increase by 17%, and the N losses through subsurface drains increase by 47%. Despite the negative effect of warming temperature on crop yield, soybean yield was predicted to increase by 31% due to increased photosynthesis rates and improved crop water use efficiency (WUE) under elevated [CO2]atm, while corn yield was reduced by 7% even with elevated [CO2]atm because of a shorter life cycle from seedling to maturity resulted from higher temperature.

Method The authors searched five online databases for articles published on spaced learning in health professions education prior to February 2018. Two researchers independently screened articles for eligibility with set inclusion criteria. They extracted and analysed key data using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results Of the 297 records retrieved, 12 articles were included in the review. More than 90% of these articles were published in the last 1 years. The definition of spaced learning varied widely and was often not theoretically grounded. Spaced learning was applied in distinct contexts, including online learning, simulation training and classroom settings. There was a large variety of spacing formats, ranging from dispersion of information or practice on a single day, to intervals lasting several months. Generally, spaced learning was implemented in practice or testing phases and rarely during teaching. Conclusions Spaced learning is infrequently and poorly defined in the health professions education literature. We propose a comprehensive definition of spaced learning and emphasise that detailed descriptions of spacing formats are needed in future research to facilitate the operationalisation of spaced learning research and practice in health professions education.",2020-03-01,Medical Education,https://openalex.org/V54816476,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14025,205,216,54,3,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996272936,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14025,journal-article,2996272936

Background Growing nurse shortage makes it crucial to understand how and why fatigue can cut short the career of nurses. Methods This two-wave longitudinal study (baseline, 12-month follow-up) was conducted among 63 French-speaking new registered nurses from Canada. The proposed cross-lagged model was analysed using the EQS statistical software package for structural equation modelling (SEM). Results Time  fatigue was positively related to time  controlled motivation (working under internal or external pressure). Taking into account the cross-lagged effects of T1 fatigue on T2 outcomes, T1 controlled motivation was positively associated with T2 sickness absence, whereas T1 autonomous motivation (working because the activity is valued or inherently interesting) was related to all T2 outcomes.

Here, we focus on the tensile properties of recycled glass fibers from scrap wind turbine blades and their interface strength with polylactic acid (PLA). The single fiber tensile and pull-out tests are used to characterize the fibers recovered through mechanical and thermal processes. It is shown that while pyrolysis can significantly degrade the recovered fibers, ground fibers with a gage length of 20 mm feature characteristic strength comparable to that of virgin fibers.

However, it is still unclear how the electrocatalytic activity is enhanced in a fundamental aspect. In this study, we systematically investigated five 3d transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) by density functional theory (DFT) to explore the ability of metal dimers to catalyze the ORR. It is found that different combinations of different metal atoms have different adsorption strengths to oxygenated intermediates, which helps to screen suitable catalyst materials. The scaling relationship of the free energy of adsorption of oxygen-containing species was calculated for various metal-dimer systems. The classical volcanic diagram is derived, and it is found that the CoZnOH embedded nitrogen-doped graphene (the overpotential is 0.6 V) shows the best catalytic properties, and it is predicted that when the adsorption free energy of OH is equal to 0.9 eV, the optimal overpotential is 0.2 V.

Results showed that the direct replication failed, despite being conducted at the same lab site as the original study; moreover, in contrast to Morriss, Macdonald, et al.

How voice and accent information in speech alter listener impressions of trust,"Our decision to believe what another person says can be influenced by vocally expressed confidence in speech and by whether the speaker–listener are members of the same social group. The dynamic effects of these two information sources on neurocognitive processes that promote believability impressions from vocal cues are unclear. Here, English Canadian listeners were presented personal statements ( She has access to the building) produced in a confident or doubtful voice by speakers of their own dialect (in-group) or speakers from two different “out-groups” (regional or foreign-accented English). Participants rated how believable the speaker is for each statement and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analysed from utterance onset. Believability decisions were modulated by both the speaker’s vocal confidence level and their perceived in-group status. For in-group speakers, ERP effects revealed an early differentiation of vocally expressed confidence (i.e., N100, P200), highlighting the motivational significance of doubtful voices for drawing believability inferences. These early effects on vocal confidence perception were qualitatively different or absent when speakers had an accent; evaluating out-group voices was associated with increased demands on contextual integration and re-analysis of a non-native representation of believability (i.e., increased N400, late negativity response).

Objectives To propose a comprehensive definition of SMM, to create an empirically justified list of SMM types and subtypes, and to use this to examine SMM in Canada. Methods Severe maternal morbidity was defined as a set of heterogeneous maternal conditions known to be associated with severe illness and with prolonged hospitalisation or high case fatality. Candidate SMM types/subtypes were evaluated using information on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebec), 2006-2015. SMM rates for 2012-2016 were quantified as a composite and as SMM types/subtypes. Rate ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with overall and specific SMM types/subtypes were estimated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS >  days) and case fatality. Results There were 2 79 cases of SMM subtypes (among  41 54 deliveries) that were associated with a prolonged LOS or high case fatality. Between 201 and 2016, the composite SMM rate was 16.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.9, 16.3) per 100 deliveries. Severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (514.6 per 100 00 deliveries), and severe postpartum haemorrhage (433.2 per 10 00 deliveries) were the most common SMM types, while case fatality rates among SMM subtypes were highest among women who had cardiac arrest and resuscitation (241.1 per 1000), hepatic failure (147.1 per 1000), dialysis (67.6 per 1000), and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (51.0 per 1000). The PAF for prolonged hospital stay related to SMM was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.3), while the PAF for maternal death associated with SMM was 88.0% (95% CI 74.6, 94.4). Conclusions The proposed definition of SMM and associated list of SMM subtypes could be used for standardised SMM surveillance, with rate ratios and PAFs associated with specific SMM types/subtypes serving to inform clinical practice and public health policy.",2020-07-01,Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology,https://openalex.org/V134018196,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12574,427,439,34,4,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968579279,https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12574,journal-article,2968579279

Currently operating radio telescopes have ushered in a data-driven era of 21-cm cosmology, providing the first constraints on the astrophysical properties of sources that drive this signal. However, extracting astrophysical information from the data is highly non-trivial and requires the rapid generation of theoretical templates over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. To this end emulators are often employed, with previous efforts focused on predicting the power spectrum. In this work we introduce 21cmGEM - the first emulator of the global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the EoR. The smoothness of the output signal is guaranteed by design. We train neural networks to predict the cosmological signal using a database of ~30,000 simulated signals which were created by varying seven astrophysical parameters: the star formation efficiency and the minimal mass of star-forming halos; the efficiency of the first X-ray sources and their spectrum parameterized by spectral index and the low energy cutoff; the mean free path of ionizing photons and the CMB optical depth. We test the performance with a set of ~2,000 simulated signals, showing that the relative error in the prediction has an r.m.s. of 0.0159. The algorithm is efficient, with a running time per parameter set of 0.16 sec.

A growing trend in microbiome analysis is to construct a network to estimate the co-occurrence patterns among taxa through precision matrices. Existing methods do not facilitate investigation into how these networks change with respect to covariates. Results We propose a new model called Microbiome Differential Network Estimation (MDiNE) to estimate network changes with respect to a binary covariate. The counts of individual taxa in the samples are modeled through a multinomial distribution whose probabilities depend on a latent Gaussian random variable. A sparse precision matrix over all the latent terms determines the co-occurrence network among taxa. The model fit is obtained and evaluated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. The performance of our model is evaluated through an extensive simulation study and is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of estimation of network parameters. We also demonstrate an application of the model to estimate changes in the intestinal microbial network topology with respect to Crohn’s disease.

Widely used estimators for the common statistics r2 and D2 exhibit large and variable upward biases that complicate interpretation and comparison across cohorts. Here, we show how to find unbiased estimators for a wide range of two-locus statistics, including D2, for both single and multiple randomly mating populations.

Thus, its’ estimation is critical to support the development of management decision including precision agriculture. To overcome challenges of laborious, rather expensive and time-consuming laboratory measurements, recent advances in image acquisition systems provided a new dimension of image-based SOM prediction. However, challenges remain in using soil images taken directly in the field due to variable soil surface conditions including vegetation cover, illumination, and soil moisture. Soil moisture can significantly influence soil color and thus confounds the relationship between SOM and soil color. This study quantifies the effects of soil moisture on the relationship between SOM and color parameters derived from cell phone images and establishes suitable SOM prediction models under varying conditions of soil moisture contents (SMCs). To simulate the continuous variation of soil moisture in the field, air-dried ground soil samples were saturated and allowed to dry naturally. Images were captured with a cellular phone over time representing various SMCs (set of images). Final set of images were captured on oven-dried samples. Images were preprocessed using illumination normalization to avoid illumination inconsistencies and segmentation technique to remove non-soil parts of the images including black cracks, leaf residues and specular reflection before modelling. Five color space models including RGB, HIS, CIELa*b*, CIELc*h* and CIELu*v* were used to quantify soil color parameters. Univariate linear regression models were developed between SOM and color parameters and an optimal set of color parameters that are capable of resisting variation in SMC was determined. It was observed that SMC exerted a considerable influence on SOM prediction accuracy when its value reached > 10%. The threshold of 10% SMC was considered as the critical SMC. Consequently, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models were developed for soil samples with SMC below and above the critical SMC. For the soil samples at below the critical SMC, the color parameter R based model produced satisfactory prediction accuracy for SOM with R2cv, RMSEcv, and RPDcv values of 0.936, 4.44% and 3.926, respectively. For the soil samples at above the critical SMC, the SOM predictive model including SMC as a predictor variable showed better accuracy (R2cv = 0.819, RMSEcv = 7.747%, RPDcv = 2.328) than that without including SMC (R2cv = 0.741, RMSEcv = 9.382%, RPDcv = 1.922).

Undergraduates (N = 424) enrolled in  universities from  countries read a refutation text on genetically modified foods (GMFs) and were then randomly assigned to receive additional information about advantages of GMFs, disadvantages of GMFs, or both. After studying, students reading about advantages of GMFs had significantly more positive attitudes than students who read about disadvantages. There was also a significant reduction in misconceptions; participants in the positive-oriented text condition showed the largest learning gains, particularly those who held more positive initial attitudes. Epistemic emotions of curiosity, frustration, hope, and enjoyment mediated attitude change while confusion mediated relations between prereading attitudes and postreading knowledge. In addition, the direct relationship between prior attitudes and surprise was moderated by type of text. When reading about both advantages and disadvantages of GMFs, participants reported significantly less surprise when compared with those who read about either advantages or disadvantages of GMFs.

The frequency of the driving force is chosen as the linear resonance frequency ( f r ) and linear subharmonic (SH) resonance frequency ( f s h = 2 f r ) of the bubble. Results show that, when the bubble is sonicated with 2 f r , period doubling is more likely to result in non-destructive oscillations. The evolution of the period-2 (P2) oscillations of the bubble makes the shape of a bowtie for bubbles with an initial diameter of 0.74 μm and above. When f = 2 f r , the phase portrait of the P2 attractor is distinctly different from a P2 attractor when f = f r , and subharmonic component of the backscattered pressure is maximum. When sonicated by 2 f r , due to lower oscillation amplitude and gentler bubble collapse, the bubble can sustain stable P2 oscillations for a longer duration and over a broader range of applied acoustic pressure. • Period two oscillation regimes of a bubble are investigated. • Period two occurs over a wider pressure range when the driving frequency is twice the resonance. • Period doubling may result in bubble destruction when sonication frequency is the bubble resonance. • When driving frequency is twice the bubble resonance, period doubling occurs at gentle oscillation regimes.",2020-08-17,Physics Letters,https://openalex.org/V70781564,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2020.126446,126446,126446,384,23,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015104322,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2020.126446,journal-article,3015104322

Here, we focus on background matching, a particular facet of crypsis that involves the ability of an organism to conceal itself through matching its color to the surrounding environment. While interesting in and of itself, the study of this phenotype has also provided fruitful population genetic insights into the interplay of strong positive selection with other evolutionary processes. Specifically, and predicated upon the findings of previous candidate gene association studies, a primary focus of this recent literature involves the realization that the inference of selection from DNA sequence data first requires a robust model of population demography in order to identify genomic regions which do not conform to neutral expectations. Moreover, these demographic estimates provide crucial information about the origin and timing of the onset of selective pressures associated with, for example, the colonization of a novel environment. Furthermore, such inference has revealed crypsis to be a particularly useful phenotype for investigating the interplay of migration and selection-with examples of gene flow constraining rates of adaptation, or alternatively providing the genetic variants that may ultimately sweep through the population.

For 0 < λ < 1 and μ > 0 , or λ = 1 but μ >  , the solutions are proved to exist globally in time, when the derivatives of the initial data are small, but the initial data themselves can be arbitrarily large. This is the so-called challenging case of global solutions with large initial data; while, when the initial Riemann invariants are monotonic and their derivatives with absolute value are large at least at one point, then the solutions are still bounded, but their derivatives will blow up at finite time, somewhat like the singularity formed by shock waves. For λ > 1 and μ > 0 , or λ = 1 but  < μ ≤ 1 , the derivatives of solutions will blow up even for all initial data, including the interesting case of blow-up solutions with small initial data. Here the initial Riemann invariants are monotonic. In fact, such a blow-up phenomenon is determined by the mechanism of the dynamic system itself. In order to prove the global existence of solutions with large initial data, we introduce a new energy functional related to the Riemann invariants, which crucially enables us to build up the maximum principle for the corresponding Riemann invariants, and the uniform boundedness for the local solutions.

Aggregate size distribution was measured by a dry sieving method, and aggregate stability was determined by a wet sieving method. The correlations between mean weight diameter (MWD), mass fractal dimension (Dₘ), and soil aggregation were investigated. The greatest proportions of small aggregates and the lowest proportions of intermediate aggregates were found under DPC₂ followed by C₆, while a greater proportion of intermediate aggregates and a lower proportion of small aggregates was observed under MT. However large aggregates (>25 mm) were negligible across all treatments. The highest values of Dₘ were found after DPC₂, while the highest values of MWD were found after MT. The highest proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA) was found under DPC₂, while the lowest proportion was found under MPDH₂ followed by MT. Similarly, aggregate stability was greatest under DPC₂. Across all tillage implements, the highest fuel consumption was recorded under C₆ followed by MPDH₂, while the lowest occurred under MT. The Dₘ showed a negative correlation with intermediate aggregates (5.0–25.0 mm) and a positive correlation with small aggregates (<5.0 mm), while MWD had a positive correlation with intermediate aggregates (5.0–25.0 mm) and a negative correlation with small aggregates (<5.0 mm). Similarly, Dₘ was negatively correlated with MWD. This suggests that farmers should adopt the technique of using a disk plough followed by two passes of the cultivator to achieve the best possible seedbed conditions in a clay loam soil. Higher values of Dₘ and lower values of MWD may be used to quantify fine seedbeds, with the converse being preferable for quantifying coarse seedbeds.",2020-03-01,Soil & Tillage Research,https://openalex.org/V1666925,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104494,104494,104494,197,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985023455,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104494,journal-article,2985023455

The first example of this effect in metal-containing systems in general, and in coordination-network solids in particular, is here reported. Specifically, attempts to mechanochemically synthesize a known interpenetrated diamondoid (dia) mercury(II) imidazolate metal-organic framework (MOF) yielded a novel, more stable polymorph based on square-grid (sql) layers. Simultaneously, the dia-form was found to be highly elusive, observed only as a short-lived intermediate in monitoring solvent-free synthesis and not at all from solution. The destabilization of a dense dia-framework relative to a lower dimensionality one is in contrast to the behavior of other imidazolate MOFs, with periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that it arises from weak interactions, including structure-stabilizing agostic C-H⋅⋅⋅Hg contacts. While providing a new link between MOFs and crystal engineering of organic solids, these findings highlight a possible role for agostic interactions in directing topology and stability of MOF polymorphs.",2020-02-06,Chemistry: A European Journal,https://openalex.org/V68911691,Wiley,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31756261/,1811,1818,26,8,,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991395968,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905280,journal-article,2991395968

Here, we examined competitive and facilitative interactions among various combinations of three widespread and often co‐occurring invaders: the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and the macrophytes Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii. Using a mesocosm‐based, factorial experimental design, we assessed the effect of interspecific competition on macrophyte growth rates in the absence and presence at varying biomass of D. polymorpha. Growth rates (wet g/day) of E. canadensis and E. nuttallii were similar when grown in isolation. When grown together, in the absence of D. polymorpha, E. canadensis growth was not significantly reduced in the presence of E. nuttallii and vice versa. In the presence of D. polymorpha (26.0 ± 1 mm), monocultural growth of E. canadensis was largely unaffected, while E. nuttallii growth was strongly enhanced. Low (2.64 g) and medium (3.96 g) mussel biomass led to negative interspecific effects between E. canadensis and E. nuttallii; at high (5.28 g) mussel biomass, the effect of interspecific competition was negated. Overall, D. polymorpha alleviated competitive interactions between the two invasive macrophytes when all three species co‐occurred, and substantially enhanced growth of E. nuttallii with increasing mussel biomass, thereby suggesting a possible influence on the relative dominance of these macrophytes in the field. Our study demonstrates how facilitations can cause shifts in dominance among closely related invaders. The consequences of such facilitations for the structure and function of communities remain to be explored generally.",2020-03-03,Freshwater Biology,https://openalex.org/V162100826,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13489,1063,1072,65,6,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000965228,https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13489,journal-article,3000965228

The linear transformation matrix of the structure is theoretically determined using its building block, which is a 2 × 2 reconfigurable MZI. To program the device, the linear transformation matrix of a given application is decomposed into that of the constituent MZIs of the structure. Thus, the required phase shifts for implementing the transformation matrix of the application by means of the optical processor are determined theoretically. Due to random phase offsets in the MZIs resulting from fabrication process variations, they are initially configured through an experimental protocol. The presented calibration scheme allows to straightforwardly characterize the MZIs to mitigate the possible input phase errors and determine the bar and cross states of each MZI for tuning it at the required sate before programming the device. After the configuration process, the device can be programmed to construct the linear transformation matrix of the application. In this regard, using the required bias voltages, the phase shifts obtained from the decomposition process are applied to the phase shifters of the MZIs in the device.",2020-03-15,Journal of Lightwave Technology,https://openalex.org/V2307745,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/jlt.2020.2966949,1258,1267,38,6,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002546743,https://doi.org/10.1109/jlt.2020.2966949,journal-article,3002546743

A building's facade, as a part of the enclosure, is certainly no exception to this requirement; however, despite the significant potential for building energy savings and reduction of environmental impacts, building facade design is not receiving proper attention. Presently, there is a need for a systematic approach to facilitate the integration of the various disciplines involved (e.g. architecture, as well as structural, mechanical and electrical design) and provide a comprehensive action plan that considers the life cycle stages of a facade system from conceptual design to demolition. This paper initially provides the required actions and considerations in each phase of design to provide a new and simplified guideline for designers in achieving a high performance facade system, with the help of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods. Secondly, the application of the Choquet integral and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is discussed to select the most suitable alternatives in facade preliminary design for a case study building, and the results are compared.",2020-07-01,Journal of building engineering,https://openalex.org/V2764478331,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101274,101274,101274,30,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005711525,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101274,journal-article,3005711525

We aimed to examine the differences in the temporospatial evolution of cortical thickness (CTh) between MS-subtypes and to study the association of CTh with T2-weighted white matter lesions (T2LV) and clinical progression. Two hundred and forty-three MS patients (180 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 5 secondary-progressive [SPMS], and 1 primary-progressive [PPMS]) underwent annual clinical (incl. expanded disability status scale [EDSS]) and MRI-examinations over  years. T2LV and CTh were measured. CTh did not differ between MS-subgroups. Higher total T2LV was associated with extended bilateral CTh-reduction on average, but did not correlate with CTh-changes over time. In RRMS, CTh- and EDSS-changes over time were negatively correlated in large bilateral prefrontal, frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital areas. In SPMS, CTh was not associated with the EDSS. In PPMS, CTh- and EDSS-changes over time were correlated in small clusters predominantly in left parietal areas. Increase of brain lesion load does not lead to an immediate CTh-reduction.

Chaperones, including HSC70, DNAJA1 and DNAJA2, play key roles in both the folding and degradation of wild-type and mutant CFTR at multiple cellular locations. DNAJA1 and HSC70 promote the folding of newly synthesized CFTR at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but are required for the rapid turnover of misfolded channel at the plasma membrane (PM). DNAJA and HSC70 are also involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded CFTR, while they assist the refolding of destabilized channel at the PM. These outcomes may depend on the binding of chaperones to specific sites within CFTR, which would be exposed in non-native states. A CFTR peptide library was used to identify binding sites for HSC70, DNAJA1 and DNAJA2, validated by competition and functional assays. Each chaperone had a distinct binding pattern, and sites were distributed between the surfaces of the CFTR cytosolic domains, and domain interfaces known to be important for channel assembly. The accessibility of sites to chaperones will depend on the degree of CFTR folding or unfolding. Different folded states may be recognized by unique combinations of HSC70, DNAJA1 and DNAJA2, leading to divergent biological effects.",2020-03-06,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61107-x,,,10,1,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010351109,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61107-x,journal-article,3010351109

Present paper deals with the nonlinear thermal bending response, thermal postbuckling behavior, and snap-through phenomenon due to lateral mechanical load in a thermally preloaded functionally graded (FG) porous perfect/imperfect nanobeam subjected to two types of thermal loading, including heat conduction across the thickness and uniform temperature rise. Heterogenous material properties of the porous nanobeams are assumed to be position/temperature-dependent, where dependency is obtained according to the modified rule of mixture and Touloukian formulation. Two types of porosity distribution and also geometrical imperfection of the nanobeam are considered. Assuming the Timoshenko beam model and von-Karman nonlinearity, the nonlinear equilibrium equations are extracted on the basis of the nonlocal theory of elasticity. With the establishment of the principle of virtual displacement and Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind as the basic functions, the Ritz method is utilized to obtain the matrix form of the nonlocal governing equations. Two different strategies, including the Newton-Raphson technique and direct displacement control scheme, are first proposed to extract the nonlinear bending and postbuckling trajectories of the graded porous nanobeam. Afterwards, to trace the snapping behavior beyond limit loads of the graded porous nanobeam with thermal preloading, the cylindrical arch-length scheme as a path-following method is adopted.

Laboratory and real world experience sampling studies reveal that attention is often devoted to self-generated mental content rather than to events taking place in the immediate environment. Recent studies have begun to explicitly examine the consistency between states of off-task thought in the laboratory and in daily life, highlighting differences in the psychological correlates of these states across the two contexts. Our study used neuroimaging to further understand the generalizability of off-task thought across laboratory and daily life contexts. We examined (1) whether context (daily life versus laboratory) impacts on individuals’ off-task thought patterns and whether individual variations in these patterns are correlated across contexts; (2) whether neural correlates for the patterns of off-task thoughts in the laboratory show similarities with those thoughts in daily life, in particular, whether differences in cortical grey matter associated with detail and off-task thoughts in the para-hippocampus, identified in a prior study on laboratory thoughts, were apparent in real life thought patterns. We also measured neural responses to common real-world stimuli (faces and scenes) and examined how neural responses to these stimuli were related to experiences in the laboratory and in daily life - finding evidence of both similarities and differences. There were consistent patterns of off-task thoughts reported across the two contexts, and both patterns had a commensurate relationship with medial temporal lobe architecture. However, compared to real world off-task thoughts, those in the laboratory focused more on social content and showed a stronger correlation with neural activity when viewing faces compared to scenes. Overall our results show that off-task thought patterns have broad similarities in the laboratory and in daily life, and the apparent differences may be, in part, driven by the richer environmental context in the real world. More generally, our findings are broadly consistent with emerging evidence that shows off-task thoughts emerge through the prioritisation of information that has greater personal relevance than events in the here and now. • Laboratory and daily life patterns of thought show both similarities and differences. • Thoughts from both contexts have similar associations with medial temporal lobe grey matter. • Laboratory off-task thoughts have stronger emphasis on content related to other people. • Laboratory off-task thoughts are linked to greater neural activity when viewing faces.",2020-07-01,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116765,116765,116765,214,,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012566037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116765,journal-article,3012566037

We also found a serial, indirect effect of maternal childhood adversity on child negative emotionality/behavioral mediated first by maternal depression and then by maternal sensitivity (95% confidence interval [0.031, 0.156]). Results suggest the intergenerational transmission of the effects of maternal childhood adversity to the offspring occurs through a two-step, serial pathway, involving maternal depression and maternal sensitivity.",2020-05-01,Development and Psychopathology,https://openalex.org/V6115874,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579419000488,605,613,32,2,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2949005781,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579419000488,journal-article,2949005781

SAGES is developing a series of VBA tools with enough validity evidence to allow reliable measurement of surgeon competence. A task force was established to develop a VBA tool for laparoscopic fundoplication using an evidence-based process that can be replicated for additional procedures. The first step in this process was to seek content validity evidence. Forty-two subject matter experts (SME) in laparoscopic fundoplication were interviewed to obtain consensus on procedural steps, identify potential variations in technique, and to generate an inventory of required skills and common errors. The results of these interviews were used to inform creation of a task inventory questionnaire (TIQ) that was delivered to a larger SME group (n = 188) to quantify the criticality and difficulty of the procedural steps, the impact of potential errors associated with each step, the technical skills required to complete the procedure, and the likelihood that future techniques or technologies may change the presence or importance of any of these factors. Results of the TIQ were used to generate a list of steps, skills, and errors with strong validity evidence. Initial SMEs interviewed included fellowship program directors (45%), recent fellows (24%), international surgeons (19%), and highly experienced super SMEs with quality outcomes data (12%). Qualitative analysis of interview data identified  main procedural steps (visualization, hiatal dissection, fundus mobilization, esophageal mobilization, hiatal repair, and wrap creation) each with 2–5 sub steps. Additionally, the TIQ identified 5–10 potential errors for each step and 1 key technical skills required to perform the procedure. Based on the TIQ, the mean criticality and difficulty scores for the 11/21 sub steps included in the final scoring rubric is 4.66/5 (5 = absolutely essential for patient outcomes) and 3.53/5 (5 = difficulty level requires significant experience and use of alternative strategies to accomplish consistently), respectively. The mean criticality and frequency scores for the 9/11 technical skills included is 4.51/5 and 4.51/5 (5 = constantly used ≥ 80% of the time), respectively. The mean impact score of the 42/47 errors incorporated into the final rubric is 3.85/5 (5 = significant error that is unrecoverable, or even if recovered, likely to have a negative impact on patient outcome).

The microstructure of SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy was investigated using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Differences in the microstructures and elemental segregation of gas-atomized alloy powder, cast ingots, and SLM-manufactured samples were analyzed. The statistical average grain size of the SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy was 4.03 μm. Microstructures of the SLM-manufactured sample were mainly composed of epitaxially grown slender cellular structures with submicron widths. Microsegregation was detected by TEM, and 80- to 200-nm Sn-enriched precipitates were dispersed between cellullar structures. Many dislocations and dislocation tangles appeared around the precipitates. An EBSD test revealed that most local misorientations within 3 degrees were concentrated in fusion line regions. Compared with cast ingots, the yield strength Rp0.2, ultimate tensile strength Rm, elongation A, and elastic modulus E of the SLM-manufactured sample increased by 67%, 24.6%, 360%, and 7%, respectively. Moreover, the SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy could be directly aged at 350℃ for 12 h, reaching Rm = 991.1 MPa and A =3 %, with no need for solid solution treatment or cold working.",2020-01-01,Additive manufacturing,https://openalex.org/V2764842179,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2019.100921,100921,100921,31,,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983859006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2019.100921,journal-article,2983859006

Crystallization activation energies for each composition were calculated in non-isothermal conditions using Kissinger and Ozawa methods and in isothermal conditions using Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model. XRD analysis showed that crystallization product Cu10Zr7 changes to Cu2Sm with Sm presence in isothermal conditions. Both isothermal and isochronal calculations yield that the energy barrier for crystallization has increased with Sm addition. On the other hand, crystallization point drops to lower temperature at the expense of an increase in the pre-exponential factor. The Avrami exponents for all compositions were found to be below 2.5, indicating that crystallization was governed by a diffusion-controlled three-dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate.

The abstract result is applicable to nonlinear dissipative PDEs perturbed by a random force which affects only a few Fourier modes and belongs to a certain class of random processes. We assume that the nonlinear PDE in question is well posed, its nonlinearity is non-degenerate in the sense of the control theory, and the random force is a regular and bounded function of time which satisfies some decomposability and observability hypotheses. This class of forces includes random Haar series, where coefficients for high Haar modes decay sufficiently fast. In particular, the result applies to the 2D Navier–Stokes system and the nonlinear complex Ginzburg–Landau equations.

Latency-sensitive applications that benefit from MEC services can be divided into two major classes: 1) applications requiring uninterrupted execution and that cannot be fragmented and therefore require full offloading (FO); 2) applications which can benefit from fractional or partial offloading (PO). For each class of applications, we first formulate a joint optimization problem where the aim is to minimize the overall energy consumption across the sub-network subject to latency, transmission quality, computational budget and transmit power constraints. The proposed optimization problems are nonconvex, tightly coupled, and consequently challenging to solve. By exploiting binary relaxation, smooth approximation and auxiliary variables, we convert these problems into more tractable forms and subsequently develop novel algorithms based on the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve them. Furthermore, by incorporating a measure of user priority, a reduced-complexity solution is proposed for the FO scheme.

With the ongoing opioid epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes. According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-13), interleukin- (IL-4) and vascular endothelial growth factor.

Method The authors draw on the concept of epistemic justice, which they argue permeates the clinical encounter, to discuss how various forms of, and claims to, knowledge may influence the attainement of shared decision-making in health care contexts. The specific objectives are twofold: first, the authors draw key concepts from key Gadamerian, Burkean, and Bakhtinian philosophical perspectives to consider shared decision-making in relation to two types of epistemic injustice: testimonial and hermeneutic epistemic injustice. Second, building on philosopher Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, the authors emphasize that major changes in educational structures and systems are required to promote the critical reflexivity required to address issues of epistemic justice, in the broader pursuit of authentic shared decision-making. Results They propose three main areas of focus for helath professions education: (a) changes in content (moving from a focus on biomedical knowledge to more content on social sciences) and methods of teaching (more dialogue and the creation of moments of dissonance); (b) a re-examination of teachers' role in promoting epistemic justice; and (c) inclusion of patients as partners.

In particular, planet formation models predict that many of them should have accreted enough gas to become gas giants. Here we examine the role of the protoplanetary disk in the cooling and contraction of the protoplanetary envelope. In particular, we investigate the effects of 1) the thermal state of the disk as set by the relative size of heating by accretion or irradiation, and whether its energy is transported by radiation or convection, and 2) advection of entropy into the outer envelope by disk flows that penetrate the Hill sphere, as found in 3D global simulations. We find that, at  and  AU, this flow at the level reported in the non-isothermal simulations where it penetrates only to ~ 0. times the Hill radius has little effect on the cooling rate since most of the envelope mass is concentrated close to the core, and far from the flow. On the other hand, at 0.1 AU, the envelope quickly becomes fully-radiative, nearly isothermal, and thus cannot cool down, stalling gas accretion. This effect is significantly more pronounced in convective disks, leading to envelope mass orders of magnitude lower. Entropy advection at 0.1 AU in either radiative or convective disks could therefore explain why super-Earths failed to undergo runaway accretion. These results highlight the importance of the conditions and energy transport in the protoplanetary disk for the accretion of planetary envelopes.",2020-05-11,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa914,2440,2448,494,2,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010289210,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa914,journal-article,3010289210

While most provinces reported an increased risk of VT/SCD, a null effect was observed in Quebec (rate ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.79-1.41). CONCLUSIONS Distributed analyses allow for rapid responses to drug safety signals. However, variation in characteristics of the administrative data across research centres can influence study results. By identifying the sources of database heterogeneity, one can evaluate the potential biases these differences may introduce, highlighting the importance of considering such variation in distributed networks.",2020-01-01,Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,https://openalex.org/V140231191,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4889,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972679677,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4889,journal-article,2972679677

Our investigations using the closely related mouse strains C57BL/6NJ (6NJ; +NNT) and C57BL/6J (6J; -NNT) revealed that NNT is required for the provision of NADPH and that the upregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) activity is not enough to compensate for the absence of NNT, which is consistent with previous observations. Intriguingly, despite the absence of NNT, 6J mitochondria had rates of H2O2 production (58.56 ± 3.79 pmol mg−1 min−1) that were similar to samples collected from 6NJ mice (72.75 ± 14.26 pmol mg−1 min−1) when pyruvate served as the substrate. However, 6NJ mitochondria energized with succinate produced significantly less H2O2 (59.95 ± 2.13 pmol mg−1 min−1) when compared to samples from 6J mice (116.39 ± 20.74 pmol mg−1 min−1), an effect that was attributed to the presence of NNT. Further investigations into the H2O2 eliminating capacities of these mitochondria led to the novel observation that 6J mitochondria compensate for the loss of NNT by upregulating catalase. Indeed, 6NJ and 6J mitochondria energized with pyruvate or succinate displayed similar rates for H2O2 elimination, quenching ~84% and ~86% of the H2O2, respectively, in the surrounding medium within 30 s. However, inclusion of palmitoyl-CoA, an NNT inhibitor, significantly limited H2O2 degradation by 6NJ mitochondria only (~55% of H2O2 eliminated in 30 s). Liver mitochondria from 6J mice treated with palmitoyl-CoA still cleared ~80% of the H2O2 from the surrounding environment. Inhibition of catalase with triazole compromised the capacity of 6J mitochondria to maintain H2O2 steady-state levels. By contrast, disabling NADPH-dependent antioxidant systems had a limited effect on the H2O2 clearing capacity of 6J mitochondria. Liver mitochondria collected from 6NJ mice, on the other hand, were more reliant on the GSH and TRX systems to clear exogenously added H2O2. However, catalase still played an integral in eliminating H2O2 in 6NJ liver mitochondria. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that catalase protein levels were ~7.7-fold higher in 6J mitochondria. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that 6J liver mitochondria compensate for the loss of NNT by increasing catalase levels for the maintenance of H2O2 steady-state levels. In general, our observations reveal that catalase is an integral arm of the antioxidant response in liver mitochondria.",2020-01-01,Free Radical Biology and Medicine,https://openalex.org/V128018148,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.10.409,59,69,146,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981216939,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.10.409,journal-article,2981216939

Methodology Ten window functions for a wide range of window lengths (20−150 s) combined with Pearson and Kendall correlation metrics, were investigated. One hundred high quality rs-fMRI datasets from healthy controls, were used to systematically assess the effect of varying the window function and length on dFC assessment. To this end, two approaches were implemented: a) simulated outliers were added to the experimental data and b) the experimental data were divided into low and high motion subgroups. Results The presence of experimental motion-noise tended to inflate the number of dynamic connections for longer (≥100 s) wide-shaped windows, while shorter (20−30 s) narrow-shaped windows exhibited increased sensitivity in the presence of simulated outliers. Moreover, window sizes from 60 s to 90 s were mildly affected by motion-related effects. In most cases, the number of dynamic connections increased, and gradually lower frequencies were captured, with an increasing window size. Conclusions Subject motion considerably affects the obtained dFC patterns; thus, it is preferable to perform motion artefact removal in the pre-processing stage rather than using alternative window functions to mitigate their effects. Provided that motion-noise is not excessive, the choice of a rectangular window is adequate. Finally, low frequency oscillations in functional connectivity seem to play an important role in the context of dFC assessment.",2020-01-15,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,https://openalex.org/V132751470,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108519,108519,108519,330,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984299667,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108519,journal-article,2984299667

Also unknown is how changes in intestinal microbiome intersect with those in microbiota-specific CD4+ T cells. We aimed to quantify and characterize flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and study their relationship with intestinal microbiome diversity. Methods Blood was collected from 3 cohorts that included CD patients, UC patients, and healthy controls. Flow cytometry analyzed CD4+ T cells specific for Lachnospiraceae-derived A4-Fla2 and Escherichia coli H18 FliC flagellins, or control vaccine antigens. Serum antiflagellin IgG and IgA antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and stool samples were collected and subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Results Compared with healthy controls, CD and UC patients had lower frequencies of vaccine-antigen–specific CD4+ T cells and, as a proportion of vaccine-specific cells, higher frequencies of flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells. The proportion of flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells that were CXCR3negCCR4+CCR6+ Th17 cells was reduced in CD and UC patients, with increased proportions of CD39+, PD-1+, and integrin β7+ cells. Microbiome analysis showed differentially abundant bacterial species in patient groups that correlated with immune responses to flagellin. Conclusions Both CD and UC patients have relative increases in the proportion of circulating Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells, which may be associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome.

They are estrogenic and anti-androgenic, and thus have the potential to alter the hormonal regulation of energy metabolism, and in turn affect obesity and metabolic health. Compared to obesity alone, having metabolic syndrome (a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors) further increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. We examined whether exposure to parabens was associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome or its components among Canadians.Methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl paraben concentrations were measured in the urine of 2,56 individuals participating in Cycle  (2014-2015) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey, a national biomonitoring survey. We assessed associations between specific gravity-corrected log10-transformed paraben concentrations and obesity, metabolic syndrome and its components (waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure) via Poisson regression with robust variance estimators for binary outcomes and via linear regression for outcomes expressed continuously. We stratified analyses by age (children aged  to 1 years vs. adults aged 1 years and older) and investigated the presence of effect modification by sex.A 10-fold increase in propyl paraben concentration was associated with a 40% (95% CI: 3, 90) higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome among men, while ethyl paraben was associated with a 63% (95% CI: 2 86) lower prevalence among women. Among women, methyl paraben was inversely associated with obesity, and methyl, propyl and ethyl parabens were associated with higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. No associations were observed among children.This is the first study to report a positive association between parabens and metabolic syndrome in men. Protective associations among women previously reported for obesity were also observed for metabolic syndrome and HDL cholesterol.

These altered interactions, in turn, may exert diversity-driven selection pressure to which plants respond with phenotypic changes. Diverse plant communities may favour the survival and fitness of individuals with traits that avoid competition. Conversely, monocultures may accumulate species-specific pests favouring greater investment in defence traits. Yet, it is unknown how altered plant rhizosphere interactions influence the plant diversity-driven selection for altered plant phenotypes. We tested for plant diversity-driven selection on plant above-ground traits and how these traits are modified by their rhizosphere microbial communities after 11 years in experimental plant monocultures and mixtures. Plants propagated from monocultures or mixtures were grown in combination with their ‘home’ versus ‘away’ arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or non-AMF microbes in two separate experiments using five and eight plant species, respectively. We hypothesized that plants in monocultures may be selected for better defence and better performance in association with rhizosphere microbial communities compared with plants in mixtures. Monoculture and mixture plants significantly differed in their above-ground phenotypes. As predicted, plant traits related to defence (greater leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content, reduced leaf damage) were more pronounced in monoculture plants in both experiments. Effects of the rhizosphere microbial communities, which generally enhanced plant growth, tended to be species-specific. Significant three-way interactions between diversity-driven selection, AMF treatment and plant species showed that home versus away effects could be positive or negative, depending on plant species. We conclude that long-term differences in plant diversity lead to selection for altered plant phenotypes. Such differences may be further modified in association with the AMF microbial communities derived from the different plant diversity treatments, but often outcomes are species-specific. This suggests that plant species differ in their capacity to respond to diversity loss and associated changes in rhizosphere microbial communities, making it complicated to predict community-level responses to such loss.

The fabrication method, which combines lithography, electrodeposition and liquid exfoliation, results in a microscale fluidic reactor capable of handling small volumes (10 μl) of sample. This configuration has advantageous properties, including enhanced sensitivity towards current responses from redox reaction of dopamine to dopamine orthoquinone. The NMIs'spatial orientation inhibits the agglomeration of graphene, while their nanostructured interface enhances adhesion to graphene nanosheets. In turn, this leads to an enlarged surface and to an accumulation of free electrons on the electrode surface. The superior electrocatalytic activity for dopamine is attributed to the high density of π-electrons on graphene nanosheets. In addition, the selectivity of the assay in the presence of other interferents is assumed to be a result of the sp2 π-interactions between the negatively charged graphene layer and the aromatic rings of dopamine. At a working potential of 0.15 V vs Ag/AgCl, the assay has a detection limit of 1.13 nM, a linear range of  nM- 10 μM, and apparent recoveries of 106% in spiked synthetic urine.

Recently established methods for reducing cybersickness include galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to mimic absent vestibular cues in VR, or vibration of the vestibular organs to add noise to the sensory modality. Here, we examined if applying noise to the vestibular system using noisy-current GVS affects sickness severity in VR. Participants were exposed to one of the two VR games that were classified as either moderately or intensely nauseogenic. The VR content lasted for 5 min and was broken down into three blocks: 3 min of gameplay during exposure to either noisy GVS (± 175 μA) or sham stimulation (0 μA), and 1 min of gameplay before and after this block. We characterized the effects of noisy GVS in terms of post-minus-pre-exposure cybersickness scores. In the intense VR condition, we found a main effect of noisy vestibular stimulation on a verbal cybersickness scale, but not for questionnaire measures of cybersickness. Participants reported lower cybersickness scores during and directly after exposure to GVS. However, this difference was quickly extinguished (~ 3-6 min) after further VR exposure, indicating that sensory adaptation did not persist after stimulation was terminated. In contrast, there were no differences between the sham and GVS group for the moderate VR content. The results show the potential for reducing cybersickness with non-invasive sensory stimulation.

The first solvent shell controls boron isotope fractionation in solution, where the β values of both H3BO3 and B(OH)4− decrease with increasing numbers of hydrogen bonds. In supercritical fluids, the weakening of hydrogen bonds and the diversity in configurations of hydrated boron species both contribute to variations in the vibrational frequencies. The 1000lnαTur-fluid value increases with increasing Mg/(Fe+Mg) ratios in the dravite-schorl solid solution series. This effect, together with the crystallization sequence predicted from the Gibbs free energies of tourmaline formation, accounts well for the association of boron isotope and chemical zonation observed in zoned tourmaline grains. The dependence of boron isotope fractionation on the B O bond length in tourmaline group minerals reflects the changes in relevant molar volumes caused by differences in the mass and charge of the atoms occupying the X, Y, and Z sites of tourmalines.

Recently, RIPK1/3 kinase activity has been shown to drive inflammation via activation of MAPK signaling. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this kinase-dependent cytokine production remain poorly understood. In the present study, we establish that the kinase activity of RIPK1/3 regulates cytokine translation in mouse and human macrophages. Furthermore, we show that this inflammatory response is downregulated by type I interferon (IFN) signaling, independent of type I IFN-promoted cell death. Specifically, low-level constitutive IFN signaling attenuates RIPK-driven activation of cap-dependent translation initiation pathway components AKT, mTORC1, 4E-BP and eIF4E, while promoting RIPK-dependent cell death.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the mentoring literature across disciplines in order to bridge existing knowledge and to situate the mentoring in sport literature. Design A citation network analysis. Method A comprehensive literature search was conducted to locate influential career mentoring articles, books, and book chapters across all disciplines. Subsequently, this body of literature was evaluated using citation network to (a) identify the major career mentoring disciplines, (b) locate the most influential career mentoring texts, (c) evaluate the transfer of knowledge across disciplines, and (d) situate and evaluate the mentoring in sport literature. Results The literature search resulted in a mentoring network of 1,819 texts and 10,951 citation links. Five major mentoring disciplines emerged: academic medicine, industrial and organizational psychology, education, nursing, and psychology. The industrial and organizational psychology and academic medicine disciplines were the most substantial mentoring disciplines. Further, the findings suggest the literature is relatively disconnected within and across disciplines. In regard to sport, the mentoring research represented 1.47% of the full-network (29 texts and 50 citation relations) and is interwoven into the industrial and organizational psychology literature. Conclusion Given the limited sport texts uncovered in the citation network analysis, sport scholars can stand to benefit from the wealth of existing career mentoring literature in other disciplines.

However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. This study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. Findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions. • We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach. • This study provides theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. • This study helps improve the delivery of quality STEM education.",2020-08-01,Computers & education,https://openalex.org/V4210172634,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103899,103899,103899,153,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016300065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103899,journal-article,3016300065

The RMVDs are installed in lieu of existing steel moment connections, which occupies no additional architectural space. The system level damping of the steel moment frames could be increased from the viscoelastic segment of the RMVDs. Besides, the proposed damper exhibits passively adaptive performance. The energy dissipation mechanism of the RMVD could be easily shifted between the viscoelastic segment and fuse segment under different levels of inter-story drifts. The sacrificial fuse segment of the damper, which could be easily replaced after an earthquake event, provides ductile and stable performance when the inter-story drifts exceed a predefined threshold. The paper first presents a systemic investigation of the performance of viscoelastic material. Then, a series of dynamic experimental studies were carried out on the viscoelastic segment when subjected to input motions that feature different frequencies and magnitudes, providing a comprehensive overview of the damper performance. Furthermore, the numerical simulation of the damper is provided at the component level. Finally, a steel portal frame is simulated as a case study to present the structural performance with the dampers under static pushover loads. The result of the study shows that the energy dissipation capacity of steel moment frames could be improved throughout the implementation of such devices. • An innovative replaceable moment-resisting viscoelastic damper (RMVD) is developed. • Energy dissipation of the RMVD can be shifted between viscoelastic and fuse segments. • Performance of RMVD is studied by experiment and numerical analyses. • Energy dissipation capacity of steel moment frames can be improved with the device.",2020-07-01,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,https://openalex.org/V154695693,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcsr.2020.106100,106100,106100,170,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018698426,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcsr.2020.106100,journal-article,3018698426

To contain the growth of space debris in the long term, active removal of large defunct spacecraft is needed. A promising solution to this problem is the use of tether-nets. In the envisaged mission, a net is released from a chaser spacecraft toward a target debris; the net entangles the debris and the tether provides a flexible link between chaser and debris to tug the debris to a disposal orbit. The present work is focused on the simulation and control of a tether-actuated closing mechanism. In this concept, proposed only recently, the tether is looped through the center of the net and around the perimeter, and spooling the tether in draws the net perimeter closed. In this paper, a dynamic model of a tether-actuated closing mechanism for net-based capture of space debris is developed. The model of the winch, which is key to the control of the closing mechanism, is established based on literature on the design of reeling mechanisms for tether-nets. Two control laws for the winch velocity during deployment and closure of the net, respectively, are formulated and tested in simulation. Simulations of the capture of a Zenit-2 rocket upper stage are performed using a proportional-derivative tension control law with gain scheduling based on tether length. Results support feasibility of the tether-actuated closing mechanism.",2020-09-01,Acta Astronautica,https://openalex.org/V179591353,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.04.052,347,358,174,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022512983,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.04.052,journal-article,3022512983

We introduce a statistical model for estimating the sample index-hopping rate in multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data and for probabilistic inference of the true sample of origin of hopped reads. We analyze several datasets and estimate the sample index hopping probability to range between 0.003–0.009, a small number that counter-intuitively gives rise to a large fraction of phantom molecules — the fraction of phantom molecules exceeds 8% in more than 25% of samples and reaches as high as 85% in low-complexity samples. Phantom molecules lead to widespread complications in downstream analyses, including transcriptome mixing across cells, emergence of phantom copies of cells from other samples, and misclassification of empty droplets as cells.

Here, using an array of sixteen validated BRET-based biosensors, we analyzed the ability of seven different β-adrenergic ligands to engage five distinct signalling pathways downstream of the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR). In addition to generating signalling signatures and capturing functional selectivity for the different ligands toward these pathways, we also revealed coupling to signalling pathways that have not previously been ascribed to the βAR. These include coupling to G z and G 12 pathways. The signalling cascade linking the β 1 AR to calcium mobilization was also characterized using a combination of BRET-based biosensors and CRISPR-engineered HEK 29 cells lacking the Gαs subunit or with pharmacological or genetically engineered pathway inhibitors. We show that both G s and G 12 are required for the full calcium response.

Understanding the behavior of a geogrid under pullout loading is essential for the analysis and design of reinforced soil systems. The overall behavior of reinforced soils is generally dependent on the properties of the geogrid material, the backfill soil, and the interface condition. Modeling the three-dimensional aspects of soil–geogrid interaction under pullout loading condition is numerically challenging and requires special consideration of the different modes of resistance that contribute to the pullout capacity of the geogrid reinforcement. This study describes the results of a three-dimensional finite-element analysis that has been developed to investigate the behavior of a biaxial geogrid embedded in granular backfill material and subjected to pullout loading. The modeling approach considers the noncontinuous nature of the geogrid geometry and the elastoplastic response of the geogrid material. Model validation is performed by simulating laboratory-size pullout test and comparing the experimental data with the analytical as well as numerically calculated results. The detailed behavior of the geogrid and the surrounding backfill is investigated using the proposed numerical approach.

The main disadvantage of the DRASTIC method is the difficulty associated with identifying appropriate ratings and weight assignments for each parameter. To mitigate this issue, ratings and weights can be approximated using different methods appropriate to the conditions of the study area. In this study, different linear (i.e., Wilcoxon test and statistical approaches) and nonlinear (Genetic algorithm [GA]) modifications for calibration of the DRASTIC framework using nitrate (NO3 ) concentrations were compared through the preparation of groundwater vulnerability maps of the Meshqin-Shahr plain, Iran. Twenty-two groundwater samples were collected from wells in the study area, and their respective NO3 concentrations were used to modify the ratings and weights of the DRASTIC parameters. The areas found to have the highest vulnerability were in the eastern, central, and western regions of the plain. Results showed that the modified DRASTIC frameworks performed well, compared to the unmodified DRASTIC. When measured NO3 concentrations were correlated with the vulnerability indices produced by each method, the unmodified DRASTIC method performed most poorly, and the Wilcoxon-GA-DRASTIC method proved optimal. Compared to the unmodified DRASTIC method with an R2 of 0.22, the Wilcoxon-GA-DRASTIC obtained a maximum R2 value of 0.78.

Appropriate design of these techniques such as CO2 gas injection process needs accurate knowledge of the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) allowing to the injected gas to be miscible with the oil. In this paper, three intelligent models named group method of data handling (GMDH), adaptive boosting support vector regression (AdaBoost SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were implemented for MMP prediction in systems oil - CO2 streams. To this end, a widespread databank covering extended range of reservoirs and thermodynamic conditions was considered. The data bank covers dead and live oils under reservoir temperatures up to 388.73 K, while the gathered real MMP values were ranged between 6.54 MPa and 31.30 MPa. Graphical and statistical assessment criteria were performed to examine the reliability of the implemented paradigms and to compare them with the most well-known models. The results of this study indicated that the established models outperform the existing ones. In addition, among the proposed models, AdaBoost SVR has the highest accuracy with an Average Absolute Percent Relative Error (AAPRE) of 3.09% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9 MPa.

We argue that collective autonomy restriction motivates groups (both structurally advantaged and disadvantaged) to improve their power position within the social hierarchy. Four studies spanning real-world (Studies 1 and 2) and lab-based (Studies 3 and 4) intergroup contexts supported these ideas. In Study 1 (N = 311), Black Americans' (a relatively disadvantaged group) experience of collective autonomy restriction was associated with greater support for collective action, and less system justification. In Study 2, we replicated these findings with another sample of Black Americans (N = 292). We also found that collective autonomy restriction was positively associated with White Americans' (a relatively advantaged group, N = 294) support for collective action and ideologies that bolster White's dominant position. In Study 3 (N = 387, 9 groups), groups that were susceptible to being controlled by a high-power group (i.e., were of low structural power) desired group power more when their collective autonomy was restricted (vs. supported). In Study  (N = 803, 25 groups) experiencing collective autonomy restriction (vs. support) increased low-power group members' support of collective action, decreased system justification, and evoked hostile emotions, both when groups were and were not materially exploited (by being tasked with more than their fair share of work). Across studies, we differentiate collective autonomy restriction from structural group power, other forms of injustice, group agency, and group identification. These findings indicate that collective autonomy restriction uniquely motivates collective behavior.

We were able to achieve data saturation using a limited number of resources. Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by consensus.Eleven US states, the District of Columbia, and Canada have enacted legal recreational cannabis regulations.

Most jurisdictions allow for home growing of up to  (US) or  (Canada) plants and a maximum possession of  oz. (US) or 1.06 oz. (Canada). Cannabis is available for purchase only in private retail stores in US states, while Canada has also legalized online sales. Impaired driving assessment is not cannabis-specific in most US states, while Canada has federal driving limits.Although North American approaches to regulating recreational cannabis use are consistent in many aspects, some exceptions exist (e.g., home growing, personal possession).

Transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples is an excellent tool to understand drug bioactivity, identify candidate biomarkers and assess for mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Methods Thirty-six patients with untreated primary breast cancer were recruited to a window study and transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples carried out before and after metformin treatment. Results Multiple genes that regulate fatty acid oxidation were upregulated at the transcriptomic level and there was a differential change in expression between two previously identified cohorts of patients with distinct metabolic responses. Increase in expression of a mitochondrial fatty oxidation gene composite signature correlated with change in a proliferation gene signature. In vitro assays showed that, in contrast to previous studies in models of normal cells, metformin reduces fatty acid oxidation with a subsequent accumulation of intracellular triglyceride, independent of AMPK activation. Conclusions We propose that metformin at clinical doses targets fatty acid oxidation in cancer cells with implications for patient selection and drug combinations.

Several observational studies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reported inconsistent results, either significant reductions in lung cancer incidence with ICS use or no effect. We assessed this association, using an approach that avoided biases affecting some of the studies. Methods A cohort of patients with COPD, new users of long-acting bronchodilators over 2000–2014, was formed using the Quebec healthcare databases, and followed until 201 for a first diagnosis of lung cancer. A 1-year delay after cohort entry was used to avoid protopathic bias and a 1-year latency period was included after the initiation of ICS use. A time-dependent Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of lung cancer associated with ICS exposure, adjusted for covariates. Results The cohort involved 6 27 subjects, including 63% receiving ICS, with 374 lung cancers occurring during a mean follow-up of  years. The adjusted HR of lung cancer associated with any ICS exposure was 1.0 (95% CI 0.94–1.08), relative to no ICS use. The HR with longer time (&gt; years) since ICS initiation was 0.92 (95% CI 0.83–1.03), while with higher mean daily ICS dose (&gt;100 μg fluticasone equivalents) was 1.3 (95% CI 1.03–1.81).

While saline soils are widely distributed and gradually expanding worldwide, the effect of soil salinity on soil NH3 and N2O emissions is poorly understood. To assess the effect of soil salinity levels on NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions, a field experiment was conducted with three soil salinity levels (S0 = non-saline, S1 = 1.0 dS m−1 and S2 = 5.0 dS m−1) and two N fertilizer types (urea and ammonium sulphate).

Therefore, to estimate the availability of land surface solar irradiance necessary for solar applications and to model available energy potential, physically-based models drawing on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) data and associated statistics for key atmospheric constituents, were employed. To assess wind energy resources, model output statistics (MOS) were integrated from post-processed Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) variables, thereby removing any systematic bias arising from long-term regression methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) served to compare pyranometer- and satellite-sourced solar radiation, under instantaneous (87.90 W m−2 and 16.84 W m−2, respectively) and daily ‘all sky conditions’ (624.98 Wh m−2 d−1 and 13.89 Wh m−2 d−1, respectively). These low values indicate that satellite-based solar irradiance is sufficiently accurate to be used to model future land surface solar energy in North Korea. In the evaluation of wind energy resources, daily wind speeds obtained from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) reanalysis fields showed good accuracy compared to a meteorological tower measurement (RMSE = 0.37 m s−1 and MBE = 0.24 m s−1). In the study region, mean wind energy potential (from 2013–2015) was 3.44 kWh m−2 d−1, whereas solar energy potential was slightly lower at 3.36 kWh m−2 d−1; this can be attributed to the nation's mountainous terrain and high latitude. Although the region's mountainous terrain may be an obstacle for future development of renewable energy infrastructure, these initial annual mean solar and wind power density results illustrate the significant renewable energy potential of North Korea. This situates the country in a position to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #7) of integrating cleaner and more sustainable energy resources through solar and wind power.",2020-03-01,Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,https://openalex.org/V68497187,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2019.109570,109570,109570,119,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990334548,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2019.109570,journal-article,2990334548

Few studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on functional performance, posture, and other outcomes that are important to patients after vertebral fractures. Objective This pilot study will explore the effect of home exercise versus control on functional performance, posture, and patient-reported outcome measures. Design This study was a parallel 2-arm pilot feasibility trial with 1:1 randomization to exercise or attentional control groups. Setting This study took place in 5 Canadian and  Australian academic or community hospitals/centers. Participants This study included 14 women ≥6 years of age with radiographically confirmed vertebral fractures. Intervention A physical therapist delivered exercise and behavioral counseling in 6 home visits over  months and monthly calls. Participants were to exercise ≥ times weekly. Controls received equal attention. Measurements Functional performance, posture, quality of life, pain, and behavior-change outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 6 (questionnaires only) and 1 months. Adherence to exercise was assessed by calendar diary. All t tests examined between-group mean differences (MD) in change from baseline in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Results There was a small effect of exercise on 5 times sit-to-stand test versus control (MD = −1.5 [95% CI = −3.0 to −0.07], intention-to-treat; MD = −1.4 [95% CI = −3.1 to 0.16], per-protocol). There were no other major or statistically significant MDs for any other measured outcomes after follow-up. Adherence declined over time. Limitations Treatment effects on variables may have been underestimated due to multiple comparisons and underpowered analyses. Conclusions Our exploratory estimate of the effect of exercise on functional leg muscle strength was consistent in direction and magnitude with other trials in individuals with vertebral fractures.

We utilized the Sardinilla experiment in Panama, the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment, to test how species mixtures at the plot and neighbourhood scales and abiotic environmental characteristics affected  coarse root traits of  tropical tree species. Sardinilla was planted in 200 with a gradient of native tree species richness of two-, three- and five-species mixtures and their respective monocultures. Root systems of 12 mature trees were excavated 0.5 m radially and one coarse root was fully excavated; unexcavated root lengths were predicted using species-specific allometric relationships. Root traits included the observed traits primary root length, diameter, and number, the number of secondary roots per meter of primary root, predicted root system extent and total predicted length of roots, and coarse root biomass. Tree size scaled positively with most root traits. Species identity (conspecific or heterospecific) and size of near neighbours were found to explain more variation (63.0%) in root traits than abiotic environmental characteristics (30.4%). Trees in waterlogged plots grew fewer, longer roots. Trees reduced root system extent but grew more roots when growing with conspecifics or growing in plots of high soil nitrogen and greater depth to water table. These findings suggest strategies employed by tropical tree species to both reduce competition with neighbours and make the most of local abiotic conditions, bringing us closer to understanding the role of coarse roots in the context of BEF research in forests.",2020-03-15,Forest Ecology and Management,https://openalex.org/V195255895,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117851,,,,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999600408,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117851,journal-article,2999600408

This study aimed to map the complex dynamic systems driving unhealthy eating and to identify potential points for intervention in three dissimilar countries. Stakeholders from across the food system in Jamaica (n = 16), St. Kitts and Nevis (n = 19), and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (n = 6) engaged with researchers in two group model building (GMB) workshops in 2018. Participants described and mapped the system driving unhealthy eating, identified points of intervention, and created a prioritized list of intervention strategies. Stakeholders were also interviewed before and after the workshops to provide their perspectives on the utility of this approach. Stakeholders described similar underlying systems driving unhealthy eating across the three countries, with a series of dominant feedback loops identified at multiple levels. Participants emphasized the importance of the relative availability and price of unhealthy foods, shifting cultural norms on eating, and aggressive advertising from the food industry as dominant drivers. They saw opportunities for governments to better regulate advertising, disincentivize unhealthy food options, and bolster the local agricultural sector to promote food sovereignty. They also identified the need for better coordinated policy making across multiple sectors at national and regional levels to deliver more integrated approaches to improving nutrition.

The sex of the offspring is environmentally determined and mediated via endocrine signalling by the mother. Interestingly, male and female Daphnia can be genetically identical, yet display large differences in behaviour, morphology, lifespan and metabolic activity. Our goal was to integrate multiple omics datasets, including gene expression, splicing, histone modification and DNA methylation data generated from genetically identical female and male Daphnia pulex under controlled laboratory settings with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the underlying epigenetic factors that may contribute to the phenotypic differences observed between the two genders. Results In this study we demonstrate that gene expression level is positively correlated with increased DNA methylation, and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine  (H3K4me3) at predicted promoter regions. Conversely, elevated histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 2 (H3K27me3), distributed across the entire transcript length, is negatively correlated with gene expression level. Interestingly, male Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that globally promote elevated gene expression, while female Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that reduce gene expression globally. For examples, CpG methylation (positively correlated with gene expression level) is significantly higher in almost all differentially methylated sites in male compared to female Daphnia . Furthermore, H3K4me3 modifications are higher in male compared to female Daphnia in more than 3/4 of the differentially regulated promoters. On the other hand, H3K27me3 is higher in female compared to male Daphnia in more than 5/6 of differentially modified sites. However, both sexes demonstrate roughly equal number of genes that are up-regulated in one gender compared to the other sex. Since, gene expression analyses typically assume that most genes are expressed at equal level among samples and different conditions, and thus cannot detect global changes affecting most genes. Conclusions The epigenetic differences between male and female in Daphnia pulex are vast and dominated by changes that promote elevated gene expression in male Daphnia . Furthermore, the differences observed in both gene expression changes and epigenetic modifications between the genders relate to pathways that are physiologically relevant to the observed phenotypic differences.",2020-01-06,BMC Genomics,https://openalex.org/V28614077,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6415-5,,,21,1,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004204579,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6415-5,journal-article,3004204579

The accurate measurement of thiol concentrations is challenging because reduced thiols are easily oxidized during sample manipulation. Derivatization is commonly used to protect thiols from oxidation. The objective of this work was to systematically compare two cell-permeable derivatizing agents: N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) and (R)-(+)-N-(1-phenylethyl)maleimide (NPEM) in terms of derivatization efficiency, ionization enhancement, side product formation, reaction selectivity for thiols, pH dependence of the reaction, and derivative stability. All thiol measurements and the characterization of side products were performed using a biphenyl reversed phase liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Four thiols, cysteine (CYS), homocysteine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and glutathione (GSH), were used for the evaluation. Using 1:10 ratio of thiol:derivatizing agent, complete derivatization was obtained within 30 min for both agents tested with the exception of CYS-NEM, where 97% efficiency was obtained. The more hydrophobic NPEM provided better ionization of the thiols, with enhancement ranging from 2.1x for GSH to 5.7x for CYS in comparison to NEM. NPEM derivatization led to more extensive side reactions, such as double derivatization and ring opening, which hindered the accurate measurement of the thiol concentrations. Both NEM and NPEM also showed poor stability of CYS derivative due to its time-dependent conversion to cyclic cysteine-maleimide derivative. Both reagents also showed significant reactivity with amine-containing metabolites depending on the pH used during derivatization, but overall NEM was found to be more selective towards thiol group than NPEM. Taking into account all evaluation criteria, NEM was selected as a more suitable reagent for the thiol protection and derivatization, but strict control of pH 7.0 is recommended to minimize the side reactions. This work illustrates the importance of the characterization of side products and derivative stability during the evaluation of thiol derivatizing agents and contributes fundamental understanding to improve the accuracy of thiol determinations. The key sources of errors during maleimide derivatization include the derivatization of amine-containing metabolites, poor derivative stability of certain thiols (CYS and NAC), and the side reactions especially if ring opening of the reagent is not minimized.

The mixed initial boundary value problems associated with the adhesive-impermeable indentation are reduced to a set of coupled Fredholm integral equations of the second-kind in the Laplace transform domain. These equations are solved to establish the time-dependant indentation response of the indenter. The results are supplemented by sets of bounds obtained by maintaining a zero radial displacement condition within the contact zone and either zero pore fluid pressure boundary conditions or impermeable conditions on the entire surface of the halfspace or impermeable conditions within the contact region but free-draining exterior to the indenter.

MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  and  (MNK1/2) are downstream effectors of the activated MAPK pathway, and important molecular targets in invasive and metastatic cancer. Despite the well-known role of MNK1 in regulating mRNA translation, little is known concerning the impact of its aberrant activation on gene transcription. Here, we show that changes in the activity, or abundance, of MNK1 result in changes in the expression of pro-oncogenic and pro-invasive genes. Among the MNK1-upregulated genes, we identify Angiopoietin-like  (ANGPTL4), which in turn promotes an invasive phenotype via its ability to induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

One proposed trans-diagnostic neural risk marker for anxiety is the error-related negativity (ERN), a negative deflection in the event-related potential waveform occurring within 100 ms of error commission. The present study sought to investigate whether interpersonal stress experienced over the course of a year interacts with ERN magnitude to prospectively predict anxiety symptoms. A sample of 57 emerging adults performed an arrow flanker task to elicit the ERN at the start of the academic school year (time one). Toward the end of the academic year (time two), participants reported on past-year interpersonal stress and anxiety symptoms. Stress interacted with ERN magnitude to predict anxiety symptoms, whereby, for individuals with an enhanced ERN at time one, greater interpersonal stress over the course of a year was significantly associated with increased anxiety symptoms at time two, even controlling for anxiety symptoms at time one. These findings suggest that enhanced performance monitoring may render individuals more susceptible to the adverse effects of interpersonal stress, thereby increasing risk for heightened anxiety.",2020-07-01,International Journal of Psychophysiology,https://openalex.org/V129135363,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.03.006,27,36,153,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015822769,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.03.006,journal-article,3015822769

Ground-based observatories use multisensor observations to characterize cloud and precipitation properties. One of the challenges is how to design strategies to best use these observations to understand these properties and evaluate weather and climate models. This paper introduces the Cloud-resolving model Radar SIMulator (CR-SIM), which uses output from high-resolution cloud-resolving models (CRMs) to emulate multiwavelength, zenith-pointing, and scanning radar observables and multisensor (radar and lidar) products. CR-SIM allows for direct comparison between an atmospheric model simulation and remote-sensing products using a forward-modeling framework consistent with the microphysical assumptions used in the atmospheric model. CR-SIM has the flexibility to easily incorporate additional microphysical modules, such as microphysical schemes and scattering calculations, and expand the applications to simulate multisensor retrieval products. In this paper, we present several applications of CR-SIM for evaluating the representativeness of cloud microphysics and dynamics in a CRM, quantifying uncertainties in radar–lidar integrated cloud products and multi-Doppler wind retrievals, and optimizing radar sampling strategy using observing system simulation experiments. These applications demonstrate CR-SIM as a virtual observatory operator on high-resolution model output for a consistent comparison between model results and observations to aid interpretation of the differences and improve understanding of the representativeness errors due to the sampling limitations of the ground-based measurements.

SARS-Cov2 has infected over four million people and caused over 290,000 deaths worldwide. Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS). Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS. We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS, and thus, chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

Concerted attention now spans new scientific communities, such as climate focused socio-technical transitions literature, as well as reinvigorated attention to environmental politics or policy. Rather than being interested in abstractly explaining policy stability and change, this latest turn turns feedback theory in order to help find practical answers to long-term policy challenges. This introduction to our special issue of Policy Sciences aims to take stock of recent developments in policy feedback research and highlight some areas that could be addressed to move the field forward. We argue for taking seriously the original dictum of policy feedback as a loop in which policy is treated as both the start and end point of analysis. This requires integrating advances in policy design scholarship through shared conceptualizations of ‘policy,’ ‘actors’ and ‘agency’. Doing so, we posit, will champion more comprehensive understandings of the effectiveness of policy design choices in general, and long-term oriented policy change in particular.",2020-06-01,Policy Sciences,https://openalex.org/V197895017,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-020-09391-2,243,252,53,2,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032177368,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-020-09391-2,journal-article,3032177368

As a corrective, we present a novel conceptual framework that highlights the different causal mechanisms through which consumers contribute to the uptake and sophistication of IBEG.

It is often caused by lack of fetal movement in utero and presents as contractures of varying severity, which may affect the upper and lower extremities, the spine and jaw. Currently, no practice recommendations exist to inform best clinical practice for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.Purpose: To identify the needs surrounding rehabilitation as experienced by youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, caregivers, and clinicians and to propose solutions to develop family- and client-centred rehabilitation recommendations.Materials and methods: A modified experience-based co-design methodology was used where qualitative interviews were conducted with key stakeholders.Results: Twenty-seven participants completed the interviews and demographic information was collected where early-active rehabilitation began at birth in most cases and became less frequent through adolescence. Three overarching themes were determined for each stakeholder group.Conclusions: All participants reported that early-active rehabilitation is beneficial as it helps determine future treatments. Transition times and participation need to be at the center of interventions to ensure that the needs of youth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are being met.

However, relatively lower accuracy of smartphone sensors than on-board diagnostic (OBD)-based systems often leads to lower accuracy. We propose an ensemble learning-based model combined with the heuristic algorithm for smartphone-based vehicle steering detection in this paper. Ensemble learning has been widely recognized for its powerful generalization capability, high accuracy, and rapid convergence. However, applying the ensemble learning approach to steering detection of the smartphone-based vehicle entails many challenges due to the limitation of smartphone storage, the constraint on power consumption, and the requirement of being real-time. To address these challenges, we propose a series of techniques to reduce the complexity of the model and energy consumption, while at the same time maintaining high detection accuracy. The performance of the proposed system has been demonstrated using a real dataset and can achieve an accuracy of 97.37%.

Accordingly, governments and non-state actors have responded through various governance initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable commodity production. While the existing literature focuses largely on transnational standards originating in the North, we investigate “homegrown” approaches in the South by asking: what explains variation in the design and features of sustainable commodity governance led by Southern actors? By comparing sustainable aquaculture governance in Thailand, Vietnam, and China, we derive a novel conceptualization of two distinct types of homegrown governance approaches – certification standards and capability-building programs – and suggest that the choice between the two is contingent on the supply of, and demand for, sustainable commodity governance. We find decisions by Southern governments to supply governance can lock in top-down approaches and exclude potentially more impactful bottom-up approaches. We therefore argue that the material resources and normative concerns of Southern governance entrepreneurs lead to different homegrown approaches.

While the research on polar code decoders mostly targets improved throughput, few implementations address energy consumption, which is critical for platforms that prioritize energy efficiency, such as massive machine-type communications (mMTC). In this work, we first propose a novel Fast-SSC decoder architecture that has novel architectural optimizations to reduce area, power, and energy consumption. Then, we extend our work to an energy-efficient implementation of the fast SC-Flip (SCF) decoder. We show that sorting a limited number of indices for extra decoding attempts is sufficient to practically match the performance of SCF, which enables employing a low-complexity sorter architecture. To our knowledge, the proposed SCF architecture is the first hardware realization of fast SCF decoding. Synthesis results targeting TSMC 65nm CMOS technology show that the proposed Fast-SSC decoder architecture is 18% more energy-efficient, has 14% less area and 30% less power consumption compared to state-of-the-art decoders in the literature.

It focuses primarily on work performed in the last ten years by national laboratories and research institutions and is not restricted to primary standard instruments. The most recent absorbed dose calorimetry review article was published over twenty years ago by Ross and Klassen (199 Phys. Med. Biol. 4 1-29), and even then, its scope was limited to water calorimeters. Since the application of calorimetry to the measurement of radiation has a long and often overlooked history, a brief introduction into its origins is provided, along with a summary of some of the landmark research that have shaped the current landscape of absorbed dose calorimeters. Technical descriptions of water and graphite calorimetry are kept general, as these have been detailed extensively in relatively recent review articles (e.g. McEwen and DuSautoy (2009 Metrologia 46 S59-79) and Seuntjens and Duane (2009 Metrologia 46 S39-58). The review categorizes calorimeters by the radiation type for which they are applied; from the widely established standards for Co-60 and high-energy x-rays, to the prototype calorimeters used in high-energy electrons and hadron therapy. In each case, focus is placed on the issues and constraints affecting dose measurement in that beam type, and the innovations developed to meet these requirements. For photons, electrons, proton and carbon ion beams, a summary of the ionization chamber beam quality conversion factors (k Q ) determined using said calorimeters is also provided.

A stress coupled hydrogen diffusion finite element model has been developed to simulate incremental step load (ISL) test. It is further integrated with a cohesive zone model (CZM) based on a stiffness-separation law. The influence of hydrogen on the cohesive law has been implemented through a newly proposed approach rooted in the hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism. Finally, this coupled model has been utilized to assess hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of materials through the prediction of crack initiation time. The crack initiation time decreases with the increase of initial hydrogen concentration in a quench and tempered 36NiCrMo4 (4340) steel showing a ductile-brittle transition behavior. Similar observations were done from ISL experiments. In addition to initial hydrogen concentration, the influence of yield strength, fracture toughness and hydrogen diffusivity on material susceptibility was also studied.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy gauge that controls anabolic and catabolic processes to maintain a balance between energy supply and demand. The objectives of this study were to assess the role of AMPK on de novo lipid and lactose synthesis, as well as its regulation by glucose and acetate availability in BMEC. We isolated primary BMEC from the mammary tissue of  lactating Holstein cows and differentiated them with lactogenic hormones for 4 d. We measured protein abundance, site-specific phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing by immunoblotting. We quantified the expression of genes involved in lipid and lactose synthesis using real-time quantitative PCR. We measured de novo lipid and lactose synthesis by incorporation of radioactive substrates. We analyzed data by ANOVA using a randomized complete block design with PROC MIXED in SAS. To assess the effect of AMPK activation on milk component synthesis, we treated BMEC with 10 μ<i>M</i> A-769662 (A76; an allosteric activator of AMPK) or vehicle control for 1 h. Consistent with activation of AMPK, A76 increased phosphorylation of its downstream targets ACC Ser7 and TSC2 Ser138 by 144% and 26%, respectively. Activation of AMPK decreased lipid synthesis by 19%. This effect was accompanied by increased expression of <i>FABP3</i>. Activation of AMPK reduced the proportion of mature SREBP-1c. In addition, AMPK activation reduced lactose synthesis by 24% and lowered the expression of <i>SLC2A1</i>, the gene encoding GLUT1. To assess the regulation of AMPK by energy substrate availability, we incubated BMEC in a control medium containing 4 m<i>M</i> D-glucose and  m<i>M</i> sodium acetate, or medium lacking glucose or acetate, for 4 h. Compared with the control medium, deprivation of glucose or acetate promoted AMPKα phosphorylation at Thr172 by 84% or 58%, respectively. Activation of AMPK was significantly increased in BMEC only when the medium was devoid of glucose for at least 4 h. We concluded that activation of AMPK inhibits de novo lipid and lactose synthesis in BMEC. Further studies are needed to assess the physiological relevance of AMPK activation for milk composition in vivo and to identify the mechanisms mediating its effects on milk component synthesis.",2020-01-01,Journal of Dairy Science,https://openalex.org/V28349394,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16343,340,351,103,1,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987558662,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16343,journal-article,2987558662

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) is increasing across the developed countries, whereas the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is declining. Several risk factors have been identified in the pathogenesis of each subtype, however, their epidemiologic characteristics and distribution throughout Canada remain poorly understood. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of demographic data across Canada from 1992 to 201 using two independent population-based cancer registries. The incidence of esophageal cancer, for each subtype, was examined at the levels of provinces/territories, cities, and postal codes. Results A total of 1 79 patients were diagnosed with esophageal cancer in Canada between 1992 and 2010; 74% were males. The average national incidence rate was 33.5 cases per million individuals per year. Incidence of esophageal AC increased over time, with notable high-incidence rates on the Vancouver Island, the coasts of the Great Lakes, and the coasts of the Northumberland Strait in the Maritimes. The overall incidence of esophageal SCC has decreased. However, high incidence of esophageal SCC was detected in the Vancouver city, rural eastern Quebec, and in the Maritimes. We also report clustering for each subtype using postal codes, which sheds light onto new avenues of research for potential environmental etiologies.

While chronic helminth infections are characterized by a well-described Type 2 immune response, the early, tissue-invasive stages are not well understood. Here we investigate the immune pathways activated during the early stages of Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a natural parasitic roundworm of mice. In contrast to the Type 2 immune response present at later stages of infection, a robust Type  immune signature including IFNg production was dominant at the time of parasite invasion and granuloma formation. This early response was associated with an accumulation of activated Natural Killer (NK) cells, with no increase of other innate lymphoid cell populations. Parabiosis and confocal microscopy studies indicated that NK cells were recruited from circulation to the small intestine, where they surrounded parasitic larvae. NK cell recruitment required IFNγ receptor signaling, but was independent of CXCR3 expression. The depletion of tissue-infiltrating NK cells altered neither worm burden nor parasite fitness, but increased vascular injury, suggesting a role for NK cells in mediating tissue protection. Together, these data identify an unexpected role for NK cells in promoting disease tolerance during the invasive stage of an enteric helminth infection.",2020-03-01,Mucosal Immunology,https://openalex.org/V68384121,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-019-0231-8,357,370,13,2,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991211367,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-019-0231-8,journal-article,2991211367

We investigated a novel role of artesunate in regulating innate immunity, including both macrophages (MΦ) and dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to involve in DSS-induced colitis. Effects of artesunate on innate immunity were extensively evaluated, both in vivo using DSS-colitis model with WT and T cell-deficient RAG mice (RAG−/−) and in vitro using cell culture models, including in-depth analyses of MΦ/DC apoptosis and cytokine expression by flow cytometry, Western blot, or immunohistology. Unexpectedly, artesunate significantly ameliorated the DSS colitis of both WT and RAG1−/− mice with similar potency, suggesting a mechanism that involves primarily innate rather than adaptive immunity. In vivo mechanistic studies revealed that artesunate markedly induced apoptosis of lamina propria MΦs and DCs and suppressed mucosal TNF-α and IL-12p70 in DSS-colitis. In vitro, artesunate potently induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis of murine bone marrow-derived DCs and human THP-1 MΦs, through the caspases-9-mediated intrinsic pathway. Artesunate significantly decreased the secretion of IL-12p40/70 by DCs and TNF-α by MΦs. Furthermore, a combination of artesunate with an immunomodulator (methotrexate/triptolide/azathioprine) exhibited superior potency in promoting apoptosis of MΦs than any individual drug alone. The immunomodulatory mechanism of artesunate in colitis involves a novel and potent induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway of proliferating MΦs and DCs and suppression of IL-12 and TNF-α.

The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene is epigenetically regulated, and studies have shown associations between OXTR and social behaviours in various samples, including women with AN. The present study examined differential levels of methylation at various CG sites of the OXTR gene in 6 women with active AN (AN-Active), 2 in whom AN was in remission (AN-Rem) and 3 with no eating disorder (NED). Within each group, we explored the correlation between methylation and measures of social behaviour such as insecure attachment and social avoidance. Hypermethylation of a number of CG sites was seen in AN-Active participants as compared with AN-Rem and NED participants. In the AN-Rem sample, methylation at CG2750175 was significantly positively correlated with insecure attachment (r = .614, p = .003, permutation Q = 0.008) and social avoidance (r = .588, p = .005, permutation Q = 0.0184).

Objectives To describe clinical events during ET-CPAP and to assess accuracy of comprehensive clinical event combinations in predicting successful extubation compared with clinical judgment alone. Design, Setting, and Participants This multicenter diagnostic study used data from 259 neonates seen at  neonatal intensive care units from the prospective Automated Prediction of Extubation Readiness (APEX) study from September 1, 2013, through August 31, 2018. Neonates with birth weight less than 125 g who required mechanical ventilation were eligible. Neonates deemed to be ready for extubation and who underwent ET-CPAP before extubation were included. Interventions In the APEX study, cardiorespiratory signals were recorded during 5-minute ET-CPAP, and signs of clinical instability were monitored. Main Outcomes and Measures Four clinical events were documented during ET-CPAP: apnea requiring stimulation, presence and cumulative durations of bradycardia and desaturation, and increased supplemental oxygen. Clinical event occurrence was assessed and compared between extubation pass and fail (defined as reintubation within  days). An automated algorithm was developed to generate SBT definitions using all clinical event combinations and to compute diagnostic accuracies of an SBT in predicting extubation success. Results Of 259 neonates (13 [54%] male) with a median gestational age of 26.1 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 24.9-27.4 weeks) and median birth weight of 83 g (IQR, 690-1019 g), 14 (57%) had at least  clinical event during ET-CPAP. Apneas occurred in 10% (2 of 259) of neonates, bradycardias in 19% (48), desaturations in 53% (138), and increased oxygen needs in 41% (107). Neonates with successful extubation (71% [18 of 259]) had significantly fewer clinical events (51% [9 of 184] vs 72% [5 of 75],P = .002), shorter cumulative bradycardia duration (median, 0 seconds [IQR,  seconds] vs  seconds [IQR, 0-9 seconds],P  Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that extremely preterm neonates commonly show signs of clinical instability during ET-CPAP and that the accuracy of multiple clinical event combinations to define SBTs is low.

Current practice of spectral quasi B-factor flattening,"Abstract The analysis of structure factors in 3D cryo-EM Coulomb potential maps and their “enhancement” at the end of the reconstruction process is a well-established practice, normally referred to as sharpening. The aim is to increase contrast and, in this way, to help tracing the atomic model. The most common way to accomplish this enhancement is by means of the so-called B-factor correction, which applies a global filter to boost high frequencies with some dampening considerations related to noise amplification. The results are maps with a better visual aspect and a quasiflat spectrum at medium and high frequencies. This practice is so widespread that most map depositions in the Electron Microscopy Data Base (EMDB) only contain sharpened maps. Here, the use in cryoEM of global B-factor corrections is theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Results clearly illustrate that protein spectra present a falloff. Thus, spectral quasi-flattening may produce protein spectra with distortions when compared with experimental ones, this fact, combined with the practice of reporting only sharpened maps, generates a sub-optimal situation in terms of data preservation, reuse and reproducibility. Now that the field is more advanced, we put forward two suggestions: (1) to use methods which keep more faithfully the original experimental signal properties of macromolecules when “enhancing” the map, and (2) to further stress the need to deposit the original experimental maps without any postprocessing or sharpening, not only the enhanced maps.

To date, information on the interactions of gold nanoclusters with biological macromolecules is limited and restricts their use in living cells. Methods: Our multidisciplinary study begins to fill the current knowledge gap by focusing on lysosomes and associated biological pathways in U251N human glioblastoma cells. We concentrated on lysosomes, because they are the intracellular destination for many nanoparticles, regulate cellular homeostasis and control cell survival. Results: Quantitative data presented here show that gold nanoclusters (with 1 and 2 gold atoms), surface-modified with glutathione or PEG, did not diminish cell viability at concentrations ≤1 µM. However, even at sublethal concentrations, gold nanoclusters modulated the abundance, positioning, pH and enzymatic activities of lysosomes. Gold nanoclusters also affected other aspects of cellular homeostasis. Specifically, they stimulated the transient nuclear accumulation of TFEB and Nrf2, transcription factors that promote lysosome biogenesis and stress responses. Moreover, gold nanoclusters also altered the formation of protein aggregates in the cytoplasm. The cellular responses elicited by gold nanoclusters were largely reversible within a 24-hour period. Conclusions: Taken together, this study explores the subcellular and molecular effects induced by gold nanoclusters and shows their effectiveness to regulate lysosome biology. Our results indicate that gold nanoclusters cause homeostatic perturbations without marked cell loss. Notably, cells adapt to the challenge inflicted by gold nanoclusters.

Drawing on evidence from the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the USA, this paper examines the relationship between policy mixes and policy resilience or the ability of a policy to withstand challenges to its elements and to remain effective over time, even when deliberate efforts are made to alter, adapt, or repeal all or part of its original content or intention.

Shearing forces transmitted across the brain during concussions often result in white matter damage. The neuropathological impact of concussions has been discerned from animal studies and includes inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss. These pathologies can overlap during the sub-acute stage of recovery. However, due to the challenges of accurately modeling complex white matter structure, these neuropathologies have not yet been differentiated in children in vivo. In the present study, we leveraged recent advances in diffusion imaging modeling, tractography, and tractometry to better understand the neuropathology underlying working memory problems in concussion. Studying a sample of 1 concussed and 4 healthy youths, we used novel tractography methods to isolate 1 working memory tracks. Along these tracks, we measured fractional anisotropy, diffusivities, track volume, apparent fiber density, and free water fraction. In three tracks connecting the right thalamus to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we found microstructural differences suggestive of myelin alterations. In another track connecting the left anterior-cingulate cortex with the left DLPFC, we found microstructural changes suggestive of axonal loss. Structural differences and tractography reconstructions were reproduced using test-retest analyses. White matter structure in the three thalamo-prefrontal tracks, but not the cingulo-prefrontal track, appeared to play a key role in working memory function.

Their large somatic size, their relatively uniform and dense clustering in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and their large axon terminals in the neurohypophysis make them an attractive target for direct electrophysiological interrogation. Here, we provide a brief review of significant recent findings in the neuroplasticity and neurophysiological properties of these neurones that were presented at the symposium Electrophysiology of Magnocellular Neurons during the 13th World Congress on Neurohypophysial Hormones in Ein Gedi, Israel in April 2019. Magnocellular vasopressin (VP) neurones respond directly to hypertonic stimulation with membrane depolarisation, which is triggered by cell shrinkage-induced opening of an N-terminal-truncated variant of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channels. New findings indicate that this mechanotransduction depends on actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks, and that direct coupling of the TRPV1 channels to microtubules is responsible for mechanical gating of the channels. Vasopressin neurones also respond to osmostimulation by activation of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC). It was shown recently that changes in ENaC activity modulate magnocellular neurone basal firing by generating tonic changes in membrane potential. Both oxytocin and VP neurones also undergo robust excitatory synapse plasticity during chronic osmotic stimulation. Recent findings indicate that new glutamate synapses induced during chronic salt loading express highly labile Ca2+ -permeable GluA1 receptors requiring continuous dendritic protein synthesis for synapse maintenance. Finally, recordings from the uniquely tractable neurohypophysial terminals recently revealed an unexpected property of activity-dependent neuropeptide release. A significant fraction of the voltage-dependent neurohypophysial neurosecretion was found to be independent of Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Here, we investigated the profile of accessible chromatin enhanced in stimulated human macrophages using ATAC-seq to assess the role of different TE subfamilies in regulating gene expression following an immune response. We found that both previously identified and new repeats belonging to the MER44, THE1, Tigger3 and MLT1 families provide 14 subfamilies that are enriched in differentially accessible chromatin and found near differentially expressed genes. These TEs also harbour binding motifs for several candidate transcription factors, including important immune regulators AP-1 and NF-κB, present in 96% of accessible MER44B and 83% of THE1C instances, respectively. To more directly assess their regulatory potential, we evaluated the presence of these TEs in regions putatively affecting gene expression, as defined by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, and found that repeats are also contributing to accessible elements near QTLs. Together, these results suggest that a number of TE families have contributed to the regulation of gene expression in the context of the immune response to infection in humans.

On going from baseline to lower body negative pressure (LBNP; simulated orthostatic stress), baroreflex slopes for some clusters of medium APs expressed the greatest increase, while slopes for large APs also increased but to a lesser degree. A subpopulation of previously silent larger APs was recruited with LBNP but these APs expressed weak baroreflex slopes. The arterial baroreflex heterogeneously regulates sympathetic AP subpopulations, exerting its strongest effect over medium APs. Weak baroreflex mechanisms govern the recruitment of latent larger AP subpopulations during orthostatic stress. Abstract Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) occurs primarily in bursts of action potentials (AP) with subpopulations that differ in size and discharge probabilities. The mechanisms determining these discharge patterns remain unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that variations in AP discharge are due to subpopulation-specific baroreflex control. We employed multi-unit microneurography and a continuous wavelet analysis approach to extract sympathetic APs in 1 healthy individuals during baseline (BSL) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -40, -60, -80 mmHg). For each AP cluster, the baroreflex threshold slope was measured from the linear regression between AP probability (%) and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). During BSL, the baroreflex exerted non-uniform regulation over AP subpopulations: medium-sized AP clusters expressed the greatest slopes while clusters of small and large APs expressed weaker slopes. On going from BSL to LBNP, the baroreflex slopes for each AP subpopulation were modified differently. Baroreflex slopes (%/mmHg) for some medium APs (cluster 5: -4.4 ±  to -9.1 ± 5) expressed the greatest increase with LBNP, while slopes for large APs (cluster 9: -1.3 ±  to -2. ± 2) also increased, but to a lesser degree. Slopes for small APs present at BSL exhibited reductions with LBNP (cluster 2: -3.9 ±  to -2. ± 3). Larger previously silent AP clusters recruited with LBNP expressed weak baroreflex regulation (cluster 14: -0.9 ± 1%/mmHg). The baroreflex exerts the strongest control over medium-sized APs. Augmenting baroreflex gain and upward resetting of discrete AP subpopulations active at BSL, as well as recruiting larger previously silent APs with weak baroreflex control, facilitates elevated MSNA during orthostatic stress.",2020-05-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279326,1881,1895,598,10,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008567013,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279326,journal-article,3008567013

Attenuation of KDM5B and KDM5C mRNA hampered embryo development to the blastocyst stage in fertilized, parthenogenetically activated and nuclear transfer embryos. While KDM5B attenuation increased H3K4me2-3 levels on D3 embryos and H3K4me1-2-3 on D5 embryos, KDM5C attenuation increased H3K9me1 on D3 embryos, and H3K9me1 and H3K4me1 on D5 embryos. The relative mRNA abundance of EIF1AX and EIF2A on D3 embryos, and the proportion of D embryos presenting a fluorescent signal for uridine incorporation were severely reduced in both KDM5B- and KDM5C-attenuated compared to control embryos, which indicate a delay in the initiation of the embryo transcriptional activity. Moreover, KDM5B and KDM5C attenuation affected DNA damage response and increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and decreased development of UV-irradiated embryos. Findings from this study revealed that both KDM5B and KDM5C are important regulators of early development in porcine embryos as their attenuation altered H3K and H3K methylation patterns, perturbed embryo genome activation, and decreased DNA damage repair capacity.",2020-03-10,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,https://openalex.org/V2596924766,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00151,,,8,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011460553,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00151,journal-article,3011460553

Recently, the 1,2-Markovnikov hydroalkylation of 1,3-dienes with simple hydrazones was reported to generate branched allylic compounds when a nickel catalyst was used. As part of the effort, shown here is that a complete switch of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov addition is obtained by changing to a ruthenium catalyst, thus providing direct and efficient access to homoallylic products exclusively.

Past research has identified various chemotropic cues that guide pollen tubes through the transmitting tract of the pistil, which represents the longest segment of its growth path. In addition, physical mechanisms also play a role in pollen tube guidance; however, these processes remain poorly understood. Here we show that pollen tubes from plants with solid transmitting tracts actively respond to the stiffness of the environment. We found that pollen tubes from Nicotiana tabacum and other plant species with a solid or semisolid transmitting tract increase their growth rate in response to an increasing matrix stiffness. By contrast, pollen tubes from Lilium longiflorum and other plant species with a hollow transmitting tract decrease their growth rate with increasing matrix stiffness, even though the forces needed to maintain a constant growth rate remain far below the maximum penetration force these pollen tubes are able to generate. Moreover, when confronted with a transition from a softer to a stiffer matrix, pollen tubes from N. tabacum display a greater ability to penetrate into a stiffer matrix compared with pollen tubes from L. longiflorum, even though the maximum force generated by pollen tubes from N. tabacum (1 µN) is smaller than the maximum force generated by pollen tubes from L. longiflorum (3 µN). These findings demonstrate a mechano-sensitive growth behavior, termed here durotropic growth, that is only expressed in pollen tubes from plants with a solid or semisolid transmitting tract and thus may contribute to an effective pollen tube guidance within the pistil.",2020-06-01,Plant Physiology,https://openalex.org/V42294715,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.01505,558,569,183,2,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014224829,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.01505,journal-article,3014224829

As with other MS treatments, this is often interpreted as 'pseudoatrophy', related to reduced inflammation. Treatment-related neurotoxicity may be contributory. We sought objective evidence of post-IAHSCT toxicity by quantifying levels of Neurofilament Light Chain (sNfL) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (sGFAP) before and after treatment as markers of neuroaxonal and glial cell damage.Sera were collected from 2 MS patients pre- and post-IAHSCT at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months along with 2 noninflammatory controls. sNfL and sGFAP quantification was performed using the SiMoA single-molecule assay.Pre-IAHSCT levels of sNfL and sGFAP were elevated in MS patients compared with controls (geometric mean sNfL 21.8 vs. 6.4 pg/mL, sGFAP 107.4 vs. 50.7 pg/mL, P = 0.000 for both). Three months after IAHSCT, levels of sNfL and sGFAP increased from baseline by 32.1% and 74.8%, respectively (P = 0.002 and 0.0004). sNfL increases correlated with total busulfan dose (P = 0.034), EDSS score worsening at 6 months (P = 0.041), and MRI grey matter volume loss at 6 months (P = 0.0023).

Especially in mammalian cells, the metabolic switch from mitochondrial respiration to aerobic glycolysis provides flexibility to sustain cellular energy in pathophysiological conditions. For example, attenuation of mitochondrial respiration and/or metabolic shifts to glycolysis result in a metabolic rewiring that provide beneficial effects in neurodegenerative processes. Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death triggered by an impaired redox balance is gaining attention in the field of neurodegeneration. We showed recently that activation of small-conductance calcium-activated K + (SK) channels modulated mitochondrial respiration and protected neuronal cells from oxidative death. Here, we investigated whether SK channel activation with CyPPA induces a glycolytic shift thereby increasing resilience of neuronal cells against ferroptosis, induced by erastin in vitro and in the nematode C. elegans exposed to mitochondrial poisons in vivo. High-resolution respirometry and extracellular flux analysis revealed that CyPPA, a positive modulator of SK channels, slightly reduced mitochondrial complex I activity, while increasing glycolysis and lactate production. Concomitantly, CyPPA rescued the neuronal cells from ferroptosis, while scavenging mitochondrial ROS and inhibiting glycolysis reduced its protection. Furthermore, SK channel activation increased survival of C. elegans challenged with mitochondrial toxins. Our findings shed light on metabolic mechanisms promoted through SK channel activation through mitohormesis, which enhances neuronal resilience against ferroptosis in vitro and promotes longevity in vivo.",2020-04-23,Cell Death and Disease,https://openalex.org/V185208586,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2458-4,,,11,4,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3019078212,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2458-4,journal-article,3019078212

The data were drawn from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a pan-Canadian cohort of 185 pregnant women enrolled between 200 and 2011. We quantified urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites that were detected in > 70% of urine samples collected during the first trimester. Gestational age was obtained from either the last menstrual period or early ultrasound. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the associations of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations, plus the molar sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP), with time to delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. We also examined PTB by clinical presentation. PTBs presented with either spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membrane were considered spontaneous PTB (sPTB). Additionally, we used multiple linear regression to model changes in mean gestational age in relation to phthalate exposure. We found no evidence of an association between first trimester phthalate metabolite concentrations and PTB among the MIREC study participants. For example, each 2-fold increase in any of the 7 phthalate concentrations or ∑DEHP was associated with hazard ratios (HRs) for PTB ranging from 0.95 to 1.07 with 95% confidence intervals including the null. An assessment of non-linear trends showed some evidence of non-monotonic dose-response relationships between phthalates and PTB.

VGLUTs contain two independent transport modes that facilitate glutamate packaging into synaptic vesicles and phosphate (Pi) ion transport into the synaptic terminal. While a transmembrane proton electrical gradient established by a vacuolar-type ATPase powers vesicular glutamate transport, recent studies indicate that binding sites and flux properties for chloride, potassium, and protons within VGLUTs themselves regulate VGLUT activity as well. These intrinsic ionic binding and flux properties of VGLUTs can therefore be modulated by neurophysiological conditions to affect levels of glutamate available for release from synapses. Despite their extraordinary importance, specific and high-affinity pharmacological compounds that interact with these sites and regulate VGLUT function, distinguish between the various modes of transport, and the different isoforms themselves, are lacking.

The skeleton is the major site of bone metastases from solid cancers, including breast and prostate carcinoma. Bone metastasis is facilitated by activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, terminally differentiated multinucleated cells formed by fusion from monocytic precursors. Cancer cells are known to produce specific factors that stimulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Of interest, cancer cells are also known to alter their own bioenergetics increasing the use of glycolysis for their survival and function. Such change in energy utilization by cancer cells would result in altered levels of cell-permeable metabolites, including glucose, lactate, and pyruvate. Osteoclast resorption is energy-expensive, and we have previously demonstrated that during differentiation osteoclasts actively adapt to their bioenergetics microenvironment. We hypothesize that altered bioenergetics state of cancer cells will also modify the bioenergetics substrate availability for the tissue-resident bone cells, potentially creating a favorable milieu for pathological osteolysis.

Children's Cognitive Skills and Concealing Responses to a Parent,"Children begin to use methods of concealment to achieve interpersonal goals at an early age, and the ability to conceal information requires cognitive skills to be effective. Despite research on children's lie telling, there is little known about the spectrum of concealment methods that children use, which can range from full disclosures to active concealment through the use of deception. This study focused on children's use of concealment methods in a prosocial situation, in relation to their cognitive ability. Children aged 4-11 years (N = 106) completed several cognitive activities that measured theory of mind (ToM), working memory, and inhibitory control with an experimenter and created a surprise gift for a parent. After the activities were complete, children were told to keep the surprise gift a secret until it was ready, then they were sent back to their parents, who questioned them about their activities. Children were coded based on their concealment behavior (full disclosers, partial concealers, passive concealers, and active concealers) in response to their parents' questions. A discriminant function analysis indicated that age and children's cognitive scores (first-order ToM, second-order ToM, and working memory) differentiated between children who disclosed the secret about the surprise gift and children who used partial-to-active concealment methods to keep the secret. Results suggest that younger children, and children with lower ToM and working memory were more likely to disclose the secret.

This study examined whether and when specific interventions (as part of a new cognitive therapy for compulsive checking) addressing these cognitive targets changed feelings of responsibility and memory confidence. Methods Participants were nine adults with a primary or secondary diagnosis of OCD who reported significant checking symptoms (at least one hour per day) on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A single-case multiple baseline design was used, after which participants received 1 sessions of cognitive therapy. From the start of the baseline period through to the  month post-treatment follow-up assessment session, participants completed daily monitoring of feelings of responsibility, memory confidence, and their time spent engaging in compulsive checking. Results Results revealed that feelings of responsibility significantly reduced and memory confidence significantly increased from baseline to immediately post-treatment, with very high effect sizes. Multilevel modelling revealed significant linear changes in feelings of responsibility (i.e., reductions over time) and memory confidence (i.e., increases over time) occurred following the sessions when these were addressed. Finally, we found that improvements in these over the course of the treatment significantly predicted reduced time spent checking.

Reviewers independently selected and appraised the recommendations according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. We identified similarities and discrepancies among recommendations. Results Of 4,077 unique citations, 39 recommendations were identified, of which half described their consensus process. Average scores for the AGREE II domains ranged from 33% to 87%. Cancer risk in RA was addressed in 79% of recommendations, with acknowledgement of increased overall cancer risk. Recommendations did not agree on the safety of using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in RA patients with cancer, except for the contraindication of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients at risk for lymphoma. Most recommendations agreed that RA treatment should be stopped and re-evaluated with a new diagnosis of cancer. Recommendations for patients with a history of cancer differed depending on the drug, cancer type, and time since cancer diagnosis. Few recommendations addressed all issues. Conclusion Recommendations for the treatment of RA in patients with cancer often fail to meet expected methodologic criteria. There was agreement on the need for caution when prescribing DMARDs to these patients.

The instability detector is a moving window classifier that predicts impending instability using rate of change of individual generator transient energy indices evaluated from the d–q axis voltage as well as conventional severity indices based on generator angle and frequency. A comparative performance analysis of a spectral feature based ensemble decision tree classifier with a multivariate long short-term memory network is also presented. The proposed RAS identifies critical generators through individual machine transient energy formulation and recursive coherency matrix, evaluated solely from system-wide generator dynamic states, and maintains stability by tripping adaptively the run-away generators. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme has been made on IEEE 39-bus network and it has been demonstrated that the proposed RAS is robust with regards to instability prediction and it can effectively identify critical generators and stabilize the network by tripping the same.",2020-05-01,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,https://openalex.org/V201921491,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2926243,1707,1717,35,3,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955239318,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2926243,journal-article,2955239318

This approach can also address the limitations encountered in preparing detailed measured samples using direct measurements. The current paper developed and compared the performance of three standalone tree-based machine learning models (random forest (RF), M5 model tree, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)) for the prediction of UCS in travertine rocks from the Azarshahr area of northwestern Iran. Additionally, an ensemble committee-based artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to integrate the advantages of the three standalone models and obtain further accuracy in UCS prediction. To date, an ensemble approach for estimating UCS has not been explored. To construct and validate the models, a set of rock test data including p-wave velocity (Vp (Km/s)), Schmidt Hammer (Rn), porosity (n%), point load index (Is (MPa)), and UCS (MPa) were acquired from 93 travertine core samples. To develop the ensemble tree-based machine learning model, the input matrix representing Vp, Rn, n%, and Is data with the corresponding target variable (i.e., UCS) was incorporated with a ratio of 70:15:15 (train: validate: test). Results indicated that a standalone MARS model outperformed all other standalone tree-based models in predicting UCS. The ANN-committee model, however, obtained the best performance with an r-value of approximately 0.890, an RMSE of 3.980 MPa, an MAE of 3.225 MPa, a WI of 0.931, and an LMI of 0.537, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the ensemble model for the prediction of UCS relative to the standalone models. The results suggest that the proposed ensemble committee-based model is a useful approach for predicting the UCS of travertine rocks with a limited set of model-designed datasets.",2020-07-01,Neural Computing and Applications,https://openalex.org/V147897268,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04418-z,9065,9080,32,13,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2967114421,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04418-z,journal-article,2967114421

Testing of such modeling tools relies upon an automatically generated set of models as a test suite. While many software testing practices recommend that this test suite should be diverse, model diversity has not been studied systematically for graph models. In the paper, we propose different diversity metrics for models by generalizing and exploiting neighborhood and predicate shapes as abstraction. We evaluate such shape-based diversity metrics using various distance functions in the context of mutation testing of graph constraints and access policies for two separate industrial DSLs.

A transparent real-time market for road use is essential for MaaS to reach its full potential. We focus on how network-wide, real-time markets for road use support MaaS, and how such markets can be developed. In our proposed network-management scheme, roadway tolls (for entire trips – from origin to destination) are determined in a two-stage market hosted by an independent system operator or “ISO”. Service providers purchase the product (the right to use a series of road segments at a reasonably specific time of day) in the day-ahead market. In real-time, the market becomes physical and operates under the principle of open access: road capacity cannot be withheld in real time and its use is determined by users’ decisions, guided by prices and suggested routings. Real-time road-use prices are computed using clearing prices that balance real-time supply and demand. Those with pre-paid slots can be paid to delay their travel, to create space for high bidders during periods of suddenly low capacity or unexpectedly high demand. Such policies and programs can avoid excessive congestion, provide reliable travel times, and keep traffic moving, especially as automation makes car and truck travel easier. Such policies are critical in helping cities and regions avoid gridlock. They ensure that travelers internalize congestion externalities, while enabling MaaS and other transport providers to deliver higher-quality mobility service for all travelers. Thoughtful marriage of week-ahead, day-ahead and real-time road pricing for travelers on congested networks can deliver efficient transportation systems that save time and energy, while providing signals for optimal infrastructure investment.",2020-01-01,Transportation Research Part A-policy and Practice,https://openalex.org/V159637997,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.021,58,69,131,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980375969,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.021,journal-article,2980375969

Second, immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 (IGSF1, then called p120) was proposed to mediate inhibin B antagonism of activin signaling via its type I receptor. These ideas have been challenged over the past few years. Rather than playing a role in inhibin action, IGSF1 is involved in the central control of the thyroid gland.

Thus, analyzing the cold spray characteristics of two metal powders can lead to a better understanding of mechanisms of cold spray deposition and consolidation. In this study, average 43 μm 316L stainless steel and 22 μm commercial purity Fe powders were used as feedstock. The following coatings were deposited through cold spray: single component 316L and Fe, and their binary composites with different feedstock mixing compositions of 316L-20 wt% Fe (20Fe), 316L-50 wt% Fe (50Fe), and 316L-80 wt% Fe (80Fe). Results show that the composite coating microstructure and cold sprayability (DE, porosity, coating bond strength) exhibit strong effects of mixing powders. Several particle and coating metrics (particle in-flight velocity, coating flattening ratio, coating microhardness) were also measured to further exhibit the effects of mixing. To explain these observations, a multiple particle arrangement model based on the calculated particle number fraction of the mixture is proposed.

It draws from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 201 and 201 in a coastal village located inside the boundaries of a marine park. The paper first examines why villagers have come to contest the park, and subsequently outlines the various forms of resistance they employ to mobilize their opposition. Some people are willing to protest openly, as evidenced by the destruction of the park's gatehouse office and directory signs in 2013. However, an immediate violent response to such acts from state paramilitary forces has instilled fear in villagers. The swift crackdown, coupled with ongoing surveillance from ranger patrols, has engendered a degree of discipline in some people. Rather than risking further repercussions, many villagers engage in ‘everyday forms of resistance’ through subtle acts of noncompliance to the conservation regulations.

Flood extremes, however, can have devastating impacts for riverine populations, yet there is minimal understanding of what distinguishes a ‘normal’ flood from a ‘bad’ flood, or flooding as integral to riverine settlement from flooding as environmental hazard. We address this limitation by drawing upon hydrograph data and field data collected in a riverine village in the Peruvian Amazon.

However, more distal pathways that could link urbanization to rural agriculture, including enhanced connectivity through rural-urban migration and market access, remain poorly understood. Here, we assess whether greater rural-urban connectivity is associated with changes in agricultural land management across the Global South. Such associations are complex, and thus difficult to measure at this scale. We therefore take a two-step approach to investigate these relationships. First, using a multivariate clustering approach, we define a series of rural-urban connectivity typologies from existing spatial data on land use, demographics, rural market access, and rural population change (as a proxy for outmigration). We examine the variation in key agricultural outcome variables (mean cereal crop yields, % of attainable yields met, and cropping frequency) within the typologies, which shows that greater overall connectivity (market access and population change) is associated with higher cereal yields, yield attainment, and cropping frequency. Second, building on these clustering results, we develop hypotheses about the relationship between rural-urban connectivity and agricultural land use intensity. We then use propensity score matching to test these hypotheses by comparing locations with similar sociodemographic and land use characteristics. When controlling for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, agricultural land, and population density, rural locations with relatively high market access, negative population change, and greater built-up area have significantly higher mean nitrogen application rates, irrigated areas, and cereal yields across the Global South. Results vary by region, but greater rural-urban connectivity and urban extents are generally associated with higher overall agricultural inputs and yields, particularly in Asia. However, we find little support for a relationship between connectivity and either % attainable yields met or field size.

The 14C-BDE209 and its 14C-metabolites in soil could be absorbed by the rice and gradually transported to its root, stem, leaf, and grain, with the total whole-plant uptake of 8.52, 4.55 and 3.43 nmol for HHZ, YD1, and NJ3, respectively. The cultivar of HHZ had the greatest whole-plant 14C absorption but the lowest ΣPBDEs residues in its grain, with the ΣPBDEs of 421.8, 454.2 and 967.0 ng g-1 for HHZ, YD1, and NJ3, respectively. BDE-209 accounted for 90%, 31% and 50% of the ΣPBDEs in the grain from HHZ, YD1, and NJ3, respectively. The estimated daily intake (EDI) amounts of ΣPBDEs were 928, 1056, and 2675 ng kg-1 bw d-1 via consuming rice grains from HHZ, YD1, and NJ3, respectively, which were below the safe threshold limits for human consumption. This study proved the different BDE-209 absorption, accumulation and transformation in different rice cultivars, which potentially suggests the need of considering cultivar differences in assessing the dietary risks of PBDEs.",2020-02-20,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135398,135398,135398,704,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991565584,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135398,journal-article,2991565584

Currently, new chemotherapeutic strategies are required to improve patient outcome and survival. Biguanides, classic anti-diabetic drugs, have gained importance for theiri antitumor potency demonstrated by various studies. Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor approved for maintenance therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, Snai1, a transcription factor that works as a master regulator of the epithelial/mesenchymal transition process (EMT) is involved in ovarian cancer resistance and progression. Here we aimed to demonstrate the possible cross talk between biguanides and Snail in response to olaparib combination therapy. In this study, we have shown that while in A2780CR cells biguanides reduced cell survival (single treatments ~20%; combined treatment ~44%) and cell migration (single treatments ~45%; biguanide-olaparib ~80%) significantly, A2780PAR exhibited superior efficacy with single (~60%) and combined treatments (~80%). Moreover, our results indicate that knock-down of Snail further enhances the attenuation of migration, inhibits EMT related-proteins (~90%) and induces a synergistic effect in biguanide-olaparib treatment.

However, current challenges for SG stem cells to reach the clinic include surgical invasiveness, amount of tissue needed, cell delivery, and storage methods. The objective of this study was to develop a clinically less invasive method to isolate and expand human SG stem cells and then to obtain a cell-free extract to be used as a therapy for IR-injured SGs. Human labial glands were biopsied, and labial stem cells (LSCs) were expanded by explant culture. The LSC extract (LSCE) was obtained by releasing the cellular components after  freeze-thaw cycles and 17,000g force centrifugation. LSCE was injected intravenously into mice that had their SGs injured with 13-Gy IR. Positive (non-IR) and negative (IR) control mice received injections of saline (vehicle control). Three pieces of labial glands (0.1 g weight) could expand  to  million cells. LSCs had a doubling time of 18.8 h; could differentiate into osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes; and were positive for mesenchymal stem cell markers. Both angiogenic (FGF-1, FGF-2, KGF, angiopoietin, uPA, VEGF) and antiangiogenic factors (PAI-1, TIMP-1, TSP-1, CD26) were detected in LSCE. In addition, some angiogenic factors (PEDF, PTX3, VEGF) possessed neurotrophic functions. Mice treated with LSCE had 50% to 60% higher salivary flow rate than saline-treated mice at  and 1 wk post-IR. Saliva lag time measurements also confirmed that LSCE restored SG function. Histologic analyses of parotids and submandibular glands reported comparable numbers of acinar cells, blood vessels, and parasympathetic nerves and cell proliferation rates in sham IR and LSCE-treated mice, though significantly lower in saline-treated mice.

Despite the important evolutionary implications of matching habitat choice, examples from natural populations are rare. One possible reason for this apparent rarity is that phenotype-matching habitat choice might be manifest only in those population segments for which the cost of a phenotype–environment mismatch is high, although this hypothesis remains to be tested. Here, we test for matching habitat choice in a breeding population of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka where the strength of performance tradeoffs across environments, and therefore the costs of mischoosing, can be evaluated in meaningful discrete groups (e.g. male versus females, and ocean-age 2 versus ocean-age 3). Consistent with matching habitat choice, salmon of similar ocean-age and size tended to cluster together in sites of similar water depth. However, matching habitat choice was only favored (longer life span) in 3-ocean females – the segment of the population most vulnerable to bear predation. Our findings support the hypothesis that matching habitat choice is more likely to be evident in those segments of a population that suffer a major cost of mischoosing, leading to ‘partial matching habitat choice’.

2020,2,4,1,0.00103359173126615,https://openalex.org/W3006360868,Emulation Differences vs. Biases When Calibrating Real‐World Evidence Findings Against Randomized Controlled Trials,"Actionable real-world evidence (RWE) requires accurate estimation of causal treatment effects. Calibration of RWE against randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is sometimes done to demonstrate that RWE can support the same causal conclusion as RCTs. Disagreements can occur when studies in each pair asked different questions in different populations or due to the presence of residual bias. Distinguishing among reasons for differences will impact the level of confidence in RWE.

Several projects, such as the RCT DUPLICATE initiative funded by US FDA, NIH, and others, have launched in the last few years with the aim of assessing whether nonrandomized database studies can in some circumstances produce conclusions on the effectiveness of medications that are similar to those provided by RCTs.1,2 While comparison of randomized and nonrandomized findings is not new, heightened current interest is in part spurred by new initiatives at several regulatory agencies focused on assessing the role real-world evidence (RWE) can play in regulatory decision-making.3,4 FDA defines RWE as evidence on the benefits and risks of medications derived from routinely collected healthcare data, although other data sources such as patient registries may also be used.

A key challenge for any project attempting to calibrate RWE findings against RCT findings is that differences between treatment effect estimates from the two study types can be driven by bias due to lack of randomization in RWE and/or by other differences in the design, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measurement, or motivations for patients to adhere to study medications. Even if RWE studies are designed to match the corresponding RCT as closely as possible, emulation of all study components is typically impossible.

Emulating target trials
In clinical epidemiology, it has been recommended for several decades to contemplate how a randomized trial would be designed to answer a specific question before designing the nonrandomized counterpart to study the same question. Hernan and Robins call the former a hypothetical “target trial,” which would then be emulated by a nonrandomized study.5 This process has proven very useful in clarifying design choices for nonrandomized research on medications. It is also a highly flexible process, as specification of the target trial is often iterative. Realities of data collection, patient access, and other practical considerations impose constraints to the nonrandomized emulation; the hypothetical target trial can thus be adjusted so that the design that is feasible in a given healthcare database can accord with the design of the target trial.

In calibrating RWE studies against existing RCTs, the process of emulating a target RCT in nonrandomized data is similar, except that in this case the target trial is already underway or completed. Thus, adjusting the design of the target RCT to improve the feasibility of the design in existing data is not possible, making exact emulation more difficult. Instead, investigators must adapt the design elements that they can from the trial, given the constraints of the database, and note the trial specifications that cannot be completely emulated. This process will highlight unavoidable emulation differences between a completed or in-progress RCT and the RWE replication.

When assembling a series of RWE replications of RCTs, as in the RCT DUPLICATE initiative, there will be some trials where RWE specifications can closely emulate the RCT and others that cannot be emulated as closely. Examples of the latter are run-in periods during which non-adherent or drug intolerant patients are excluded before randomization, or, to homogenize patients, run-in periods that place all patients on a common medication before randomization. Therefore, enumerating – and quantifying to the extent possible – such emulation differences can provide insight into whether and to what extent differences in treatment effect estimates between RWE and corresponding RCTs are due to bias related to a lack of randomization versus other differences in design between the two study types. Specifically, attempting to correlate measures of emulation difference, such as those suggested in Table 1, with the magnitude of differences in treatment effect estimates may provide understanding of which emulation differences are most important in contributing to the “efficacy-effectiveness gap” between RWE and RCT findings, as long as bias due to confounding is not also correlated with the emulation difference of interest. Once better understood, such metrics could possibly be transformed into a simple three-point emulation scale.

Predicting population collapse with the help of generic early warning signals (EWS) may provide a prospective tool for identifying species or populations at highest risk. However, pattern-to-process methods such as EWS have a multitude of challenges to overcome to be useful, including the low signal-to-noise ratio of ecological systems and the need for high quality time series data. The inclusion of trait dynamics with EWS has been proposed as a more robust tool to predict population collapse. However, the length and resolution of available time series are highly variable from one system to another, especially when generation time is considered. As yet, it remains unknown how this variability with regards to generation time will alter the efficacy of EWS. Here we take both a simulation- and experimental-based approach to assess the impacts of relative time series length and resolution on the forecasting ability of EWS. We show that EWS' performance decreases with decreasing time-series length. However, there was no evident decrease in EWS performance as resolution decreased. Our simulations suggest a relative time series length between 10 and five generations as a minimum requirement for accurate forecasting by abundance-based EWS. However, when trait information is included alongside abundance-based EWS, we find positive signals at lengths one-half of what was required without them. We suggest that, in systems where specific traits are known to affect demography, trait data should be monitored and included alongside abundance data to improve forecasting reliability.",2020-07-01,Ecology,https://openalex.org/V35917800,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3040,,,101,7,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009818955,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3040,journal-article,3009818955

Purpose We evaluated whether sleep-phasing regularity associates with the regularity of daily eating events. Methods ED patients (n = 29) completed hourly charts of mood and eating occasions for  weeks. Locomotor activity was recorded continuously by wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 1 days, and sleep was calculated based on periods of inactivity. We computed the center of daily inactivity (CenDI) as a measure of sleep phasing and consolidation of the daily inactivity (ConDI) as a measure of daily sleep rhythm strength. We assessed interday irregularities in the temporal structure of food intake using the standard deviation (SD) of frequency (IFRQ), timing (ITIM), and interval (IINT) of food intake. A self-evaluation of other characteristics included mood, anxiety, and early trauma. Results A later phasing of sleep associated with a lower frequency of eating (eating frequency with the CenDI rho = −0.49, p = .007). The phasing and rhythmic strength of sleep correlated with the degree of eating irregularity (CenDI with ITIM rho = 0.48, p = .008 and with IINT rho = 0.56, p = .002; SD of CenDI with ITIM rho = 0.47, p = .010, and SD of ConDI with IINT rho = 0.37, p = .048).

The utility of these molecules is severely threatened by high rates of drug resistance. The ABC transporter MRPA is one of the few key Sb resistance proteins described to date, whose role in detoxification has been thoroughly studied in Leishmania parasites. Nonetheless, its rapid amplification during drug selection complicates the discovery of other mechanisms potentially involved in Sb resistance. In this study, stepwise drug-resistance selection and next-generation sequencing were combined in the search for novel Sb-resistance mechanisms deployed by parasites when MRPA is abolished by targeted gene disruption. The gene mrpA is not essential in L. infantum, and its disruption leads to an Sb hypersensitive phenotype in both promastigotes and amastigotes. Five independent mrpA−/- mutants were selected for antimony resistance. These mutants displayed major changes in their ploidy, as well as extrachromosomal linear amplifications of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 23, which includes the genes coding for ABCC1 and ABCC2. Overexpression of ABCC2, but not of ABCC1, resulted in increased Sb tolerance in the mrpA−/- mutant. SNP analyses revealed three different heterozygous mutations in the gene coding for a serine acetyltransferase (SAT) involved in de novo cysteine synthesis in Leishmania. Overexpression of satQ390K, satG321R and satG325R variants led to a 2–3.2 -fold increase in Sb resistance in mrpA−/- parasites.

A total of 1 out of 388 cows (34.5%) were chronicPC,  cows (14.7%) were chronicNC,  cows (20.1%) were non-chronic and 1 cows (30.7%) were considered healthy, which resulted in a grand total of 11 cow records included in the statistical model. The healthy cows produced more milk than each of the other groups (+2.1 to +5.7 kg/cow/day) and produced higher milk component yields than the chronicPC cows. The healthy cows produced more milk than cows with chronicPC caused by minor (+5.2 kg/cow/day) and major pathogens (+7.1 kg/cow/day) and losses varied from 5.8 to 11.8 kg/cow/day depending on the pathogen causing chronicPC mastitis.

One potential underlying mechanism is sex differences in physiological and psychological responses to stress; however, no studies to date have investigated this proposed mechanism experimentally. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, pharmacological challenges were administered to individually suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) prior to stress exposure, to investigate sex differences in the resulting cross talk among the physiological and psychological stress responses. Sex-specific compensatory patterns and psychological effects emerged when the stress systems were manipulated. Men demonstrated heightened SNS reactivity to stress when the HPA axis was suppressed, and greater HPA reactivity after SNS suppression. This ability to react appropriately to the stressor, even with one system, did not lead to significant negative mood effects. In women, higher baseline activation (but dampened reactivity to stress) of SNS or HPA was observed when the other system was suppressed. This was coupled with worsened mood in response to stress when either stress system was compromised. Our results indicate that men and women may be differentially sensitive to fluctuations of their stress systems. This might be a potential link that underlies the sexual dimorphism in vulnerability for psychopathology.",2020-06-04,Neuropsychopharmacology,https://openalex.org/V175030738,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0726-8,1672,1680,45,10,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033220742,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-0726-8,journal-article,3033220742

Since moving to the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility, the CPT experimental program has focused on neutron-rich nuclei whose masses may play an important role in the astrophysical r process. Through a recent upgrade of the detector system, the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) technique has been successfully implemented. This method offers several benefits which drastically improve the experimental sensitivity of the CPT to the most neutron-rich nuclei produced at CARIBU.

Repeated exposure to an amphetamine regimen of 4 mg/kg during early adolescence induces, in male mice, downregulation of DCC expression in dopamine neurons by recruiting the Dcc microRNA repressor, microRNA-218 (miR-218). This adolescent amphetamine regimen also disrupts mesocortical dopamine connectivity and behavioral control in adulthood. Whether low doses of amphetamine in adolescence induce similar molecular and developmental effects needs to be established. Here, we quantified plasma amphetamine concentrations in early adolescent mice following a 4 or 0.5 mg/kg dose and found peak levels corresponding to those seen in humans following recreational and therapeutic settings, respectively. In contrast to the high doses, the low amphetamine regimen does not alter Dcc mRNA or miR-218 expression; instead, it upregulates DCC protein levels. Furthermore, high, but not low, drug doses downregulate the expression of the DCC receptor ligand, Netrin-1, in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Exposure to the low-dose regimen did not alter the expanse of mesocortical dopamine axons or their number/density of presynaptic sites in adulthood. Strikingly, adolescent exposure to the low-dose drug regimen does not impair behavioral inhibition in adulthood; instead, it induces an overall increase in performance in a go/no-go task. These results show that developmental consequences of exposure to therapeutic- versus abused-like doses of amphetamine in adolescence have dissimilar molecular signatures and opposite behavioral effects.

Assessing synchrony is challenging because many interactive behaviors may be subtlety, if at all, observable in overt behaviors. Physiological measures, therefore, may provide valuable physiological/biological markers of mother–infant synchrony. We have developed a multilevel measurement platform to assess physiological synchrony, attention, and vocal congruency during dynamic face-to-face mother–infant interactions. The present investigation was designed to provide preliminary data on its application in a group of 1 mother–infant dyads (20 subjects) ranging in age from  to 8.5 months at the time of the experimentation. Respiratory kinematics, heart rate, and vocalization were recorded simultaneously from mothers and infants during nonstructured, face-to-face interactions. Novel statistical methods were used to identify reliable moments of synchrony from cross-correlated, mother–infant respiration and to tag infant attention from heart rate deceleration. Results revealed that attention, vocal contingency, and respiratory synchrony are temporally clustered within the dyad interaction.

First, we propose a distributed runtime model to capture the operational state and the context information of a smart CPS using directed, typed and attributed graphs as high-level knowledge representation. The runtime model is distributed among the participating nodes, and it is consistently kept up to date in a continuously evolving environment by a time-triggered model management protocol. Our runtime models offer a (domain-specific) model query and manipulation interface over the reliable communication middleware of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard widely used in the CPS domain. Then, we propose to carry out distributed runtime monitoring by capturing critical properties of interest in the form of graph queries, and design a distributed graph query evaluation algorithm for evaluating such graph queries over the distributed runtime model. As the key innovation, our (1) distributed runtime model extends existing publish–subscribe middleware (like DDS) used in real-time CPS applications by enabling the dynamic creation and deletion of graph nodes (without compile time limits). Moreover, (2) our distributed query evaluation extends existing graph query techniques by enabling query evaluation in a real-time, resource-constrained environment while still providing scalable performance.

This work studies the erosion of three pin electrode materials (hafnium, copper, stainless steel) in two gas atmospheres (oxygen, air). They are powered by repetitive high-voltage nanosecond pulses, producing pulsed streamer discharges above water. The electrode material does not affect the energy deposited per pulse. The surfaces of all three electrodes erode, releasing metal particles into the water. Stainless steel is the material with least erosion, in both gas atmospheres. Overall, copper in air shows the highest erosion. We also examine how the metals released into the water affect three long-lived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), H2O2, NO2− and NO3−, during four weeks post-discharge. After treatment with air plasma, NO2− and NO3− are measured in the treated water, but H2O2 is not detected. NO2− is almost completely converted into NO3− after two weeks.

The uncertainty results from both the rapid adjustment that occurs before SST changes and the slow feedbacks that occur after SST changes. The analysis in this paper focuses on the rapid adjustment. We use a novel method to decompose the temperature change in AMIP-type climate simulation in order to understand the adjustment at the process level. We isolate the effects of different processes, including radiation, convection, and large-scale circulation in the temperature adjustment, through a set of numerical experiments using a hierarchy of climate models. We find that radiative adjustment triggers and largely controls the zonal mean atmospheric temperature response pattern. This pattern is characterized by stratospheric cooling, lower-tropospheric warming, and a warming center near the tropical tropopause. In contrast to conventional views, the warming center near the tropopause is found to be critically dependent on the shortwave absorption of CO 2 . The dynamical processes largely counteract the effect of the radiative process that increases the vertical temperature gradient in the free troposphere. The effect of local convection is to move atmospheric energy vertically, which cools the lower troposphere and warms the upper troposphere. The adjustment due to large-scale circulation further redistributes energy along the isentropic surfaces across the latitudes, which cools the low-latitude lower troposphere and warms the midlatitude upper troposphere and stratosphere. Our results highlight the importance of the radiative adjustment in the overall adjustment and provide a potential method to understand the spread in the models.",2020-02-01,Journal of Climate,https://openalex.org/V80591372,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-19-0032.1,787,803,33,3,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981493645,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-19-0032.1,journal-article,2981493645

Intracorporeal anastomosis for right colectomy may hasten GI recovery. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis on GI recovery after elective laparoscopic right colectomy within an established ERAS program. Adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic right colectomy at a single high-volume institution from 07/2014 to 12/2018 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: intracorporeal (IC) and extracorporeal (EC). The primary outcome was time to GI-3 defined as days to tolerance of solid diet and first flatus/bowel movement. Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) was defined as GI-3 not met by postoperative day 4. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and overall 30-day complications. Sensitivity analysis was performed using coarsened exact matching to account for unmeasured confounding. Multiple regression was performed using a Cox proportional hazard model to identify predictors of GI recovery. A total of 34 patients were reviewed, of which 22 were included (71IC, 155EC). Patient characteristics were well balanced between groups: mean age was 64.9 years (SD 15.9), BMI was 26.3 (SD 5.7), 38.1% of patients had ASA ≥ 3, and 78.3% underwent surgery for neoplasms. IC anastomosis was associated with longer operative duration (165 min (SD 40); 144 min (SD 48), p = 0.002). There was no difference in the median time to GI-3 (IC 2 days [IQR1-2]; EC 2 days [IQR2-3], p = 0.135).

Focusing on plant pathogenic fungi, the increased efflux of the active ingredients (a.i.) from the cytoplasm is highly correlated to elevated resistance levels to the applied fungicides. Such mechanism is regulated by ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), and although it has been investigated for the past two decades, the latest developments in “omics” technologies could provide new insights with potential applications in crop protection. Within this context, and based on results from preliminary experiments, we have undertaken the task of mining the involvement of the ABC transporter YCF1, which is located in the vacuole membrane, in the fungicide resistance development, applying a functional genomics approach and using yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) as the model organism. Among the fungicides being assessed, flusilazole, which belongs to the azole group of dimethylation inhibitors (DMIs), was discovered as a possible substrate of the YCF1. GC/EI/MS metabolomics analysis revealed the effect of the fungicide's toxicity and that of genotype on yeast's metabolism, confirming the role of this transporter. Fluctuations in the activity of various yeast biosynthetic pathways associated with stress responses were recorded, and corresponding metabolites-biomarkers of flusilazole toxicity were discovered. The metabolites α , α -trehalose, glycerol, myo-inositol-1-phosphate, GABA, l -glutamine, l -tryptophan, l -phenylalanine, l -tyrosine, and phosphate, were the major identified biomarkers of toxicity. Among these, are metabolites that play important roles in fungal metabolism ( e.g. , cell responses to osmotic stress) or serve as signaling molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the implication of YCF1 in fungal resistance to PPPs. Additionally, the results of GC/EI/MS yeast metabolomics confirmed the robustness of the method and its applicability in the high-throughput study of fungal resistance to fungicides. • Yeast GC/EI/MS metabolomics is a robust functional genomics tool. • The osmotic stress level provides information on the impact of flusilazole toxicity and YCF1 transporter deletion on yeast. • The YCF1 transporter is implicated in the sequestration of flusilazole in yeast vacuoles.",2020-05-01,Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,https://openalex.org/V9324707,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.09.013,104475,104475,165,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981973566,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.09.013,journal-article,2981973566

Subset of corticostriatal projection neurons uses Zn2+ as a co-transmitter alongside glutamate, but the role of synaptically released Zn2+ in PD remains unexplored. We used genetically modified mice and pharmacological tools in combination with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion models of PD to investigate the contribution of synaptic zinc to disease associated behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration. Vesicular zinc transporter-3 (ZnT3) knockout mice lacking releasable Zn2+ were more resistant to locomotor deficit and memory impairment of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) denervation compared to wildtype littermates. The loss of striatal dopaminergic fibers was comparable between genotypes, indicating that synaptically released Zn2+ contributes to behavioral deficits but not neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of Zn2+ actions, we used the extracellular Zn2+ chelator CaEDTA and knock-in mice lacking the high affinity Zn2+ inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2A-NMDARs). Acute chelation of extracellular Zn2+ in the striatum restored locomotor deficit of 6-OHDA lesion, confirming that synaptic Zn2+ suppresses locomotor behavior.

Lack of data remains one of the main challenges of hydrological analyses. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to extend streamflow records using a proposed approach where the wavelet transform (WT) is incorporated as a pre-processing method into eight existing record extension techniques, namely the ordinary least-square regression (OLS), maintenance of variance (MOVE) types 1–4, Kendall-Theil robust line (KTRL), KTRL2 and robust line of organic correlation (RLOC). The performance of the WT-based methods in estimating individual data values, means and standard deviations of the extended records, and a series of percentiles of the extended records was then compared with that of the respective conventional methods (i.e., without the WT). The data used in the analysis consisted of 67 pairs of target-index stations that were obtained from Canada’s Reference Hydrometric Basin Network database, all of which contain outliers. As such, the results and discussions obtained are applicable for cases where the data contain outliers. The WT-based methods (particularly the KTRL-WT, KTRL2-WT and RLOC-WT) demonstrated consistent improvements in precision and accuracy compared with their conventional counterparts, especially in estimating the means and standard deviations of the extended records. In estimating individual data values, the WT-based methods showed inconsistent improvements. Finally, in terms of percentiles, greater improvements were seen in the estimation of higher percentiles, more specifically for the MOVE1-WT, MOVE2-WT, KTRL2-WT and RLOC-WT compared with their conventional counterparts.",2020-03-01,Journal of Hydrology,https://openalex.org/V55737203,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124503,124503,124503,582,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998586783,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124503,journal-article,2998586783

The dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) may be particularly implicated in these effects, including disturbed eating behaviors that might lead to obesity. Here, we explore differential susceptibility to positive environments according to the predicted genetically regulated gene expression of prefrontal cortex DRD4 gene. Using MAVAN as the discovery cohort (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment) and GUSTO as the replication cohort (Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes), we analyzed the interaction between a) a Positive postnatal environmental score, that accounts for positive outcomes in the postnatal period and b) the genetically regulated gene expression of prefrontal DRD4, computed using a machine learning prediction method (PrediXcan). The outcome measures were the pro-intake domains (Emotional over-eating, Food Responsiveness, Food Enjoyment and Desire to Drink) from the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire at 4 months of age (MAVAN) and 6 months of age (GUSTO).

The surveillance catherization includes hemodynamic assessment with inhaled nitric oxide, angiography, liver biopsy, and transcatheter intervention if indicated. We aimed to describe hemodynamic and liver biopsy findings, response to pulmonary vasoreactivity testing, rates of transcatheter intervention, and changes in medical therapy following surveillance catheterization in stable Fontan patients. A single-center retrospective review of Fontan patients undergoing surveillance catheterization between November 201 and May 201 was performed. Liver biopsies were independently scored by two pathologists. Sixty-three patients underwent surveillance catheterization (mean age 14.6 ± 3. years). The mean Fontan pressure was 11.8 ± 2. mmHg. The mean cardiac index was 2. ± 0.6 L/min/m2. In the 5 patients who underwent pulmonary vasoreactivity testing, there was a significant decrease in median pulmonary vascular resistance (1.8 [range 0.8-4.1] vs 1.4 [range 0.7-3.0] Wood units × m2; p < 0.001). The mean cardiac index increased (3.0 ± 0.6 vs 3. ± 0. L/min/m2, p = 0.009). The Fontan pressure did not change significantly.

Depression is common among patients with excess weight, but more importantly, these patients may be at risk for poor response when treated with antidepressant medications (AD). Methods We conducted a comprehensive scoping review to summarize the evidence regarding the difference in response to treatment of depression with AD among patients with excess weight as compared to normal weight patients and to identify knowledge gaps. Results The search of the Medline and PsycINFO (2004–2019) identified twelve relevant studies. Tabulation and frequency analysis of the charted data along with a narrative synthesis were performed. Nine studies (75%) reported clinically relevant negative association between patients’ high BMI or obesity and treatment response to either nortriptyline, fluoxetine, or various AD; one study (8.3%) reported no difference in response to various AD combinations between BMI groups. One study showed benefits of bupropion and escitalopram combination in patients with morbid obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2) as compared with escitalopram monotherapy. Another study reported benefits when using venlafaxine-XR in patients with morbid obesity. We also acknowledge the possible role of sex and genetic factors predicting AD treatment response. Limitations The search was restricted to two most relevant sources, publications in four languages and adult population. Conclusion The synthesized data may be useful to physicians in their decision regarding the choice of AD in patients with excess weight.

FRAX® accepts baseline height and weight as input variables, but does not consider change in these parameters over time. To evaluate the association between measured height or weight loss on subsequent fracture risk adjusted for FRAX scores, risk factors, and competing mortality. Using a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) registry for the Province of Manitoba, Canada, we identified women and men age 40 years or older with height and weight measured at the time of two DXA scans. Cox regression analyses were performed to test for a covariate-adjusted association between prior height and weight loss with incident fractures occurring after the second scan using linked population-based healthcare data. The study population consisted of 11,495 individuals (average age 68.0 ± 9.9 years, 94.6% women). During median follow-up 6.0 years, records demonstrated incident major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in 869 individuals, hip fractures in 265, clinical vertebral fractures in 207, and any fracture in 1203. Prior height loss was significantly greater in individuals with fracture compared with those without fracture, regardless of fracture site. Mortality was greater in those with prior height loss (HR per SD 1.11, 95% CI 1.06–1.17) or weight loss (HR per SD 1.26, 95% CI 1.19–1.32). Each SD in height loss was associated with increased fracture risk (MOF 12–17%, hip 8–19%, clinical vertebral 28–37%, any fracture 14–19%). Prior weight loss was associated with 21–30% increased risk for hip fracture, but did not increase risk for other fractures. Height loss of 3.0 cm or greater more than doubled the risk for subsequent fracture.

In this study, we examined the effects of aging and the Sod−/− mutation on mice epididymal histology and the expression of markers of oxidative damage. We found that both oxidative nucleic acid damage (via 8-hydroxyguanosine) and lipid peroxidation (via 4-hydroxynonenal) increased with age and in Sod1−/− mice.

In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the pain-relief potential of a pepducin series derived from the first intracellular loop of neurotensin receptor type  (NTS1), a class A GPCR that mediates many of the effects of the neurotensin (NT) tridecapeptide, including hypothermia, hypotension and analgesia. We used BRET-based biosensors to determine the pepducins' ability to engage G protein signaling pathways associated with NTS1 activation. We observed partial Gq and G1 activation at a 1 {\mu}M concentration, indicating that these pepducins may act as allosteric agonists of NTS1. Additionally, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as a label-free assay to monitor pepducin-induced responses in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hNTS1. This whole-cell integrated assay enabled us to subdivide our pepducin series into three profile response groups. In order to determine the pepducins' antinociceptive potential, we then screened the series in an acute pain model (tail-flick test) by measuring tail withdrawal latencies to a thermal nociceptive stimulus, following intrathecal pepducin administration (275 nmol/kg). We further evaluated promising pepducins in a tonic pain model (formalin test), as well as in neuropathic (Chronic Constriction Injury) and inflammatory (Complete Freund's Adjuvant) chronic pain models.

Tobacco and alcohol consumption have long been identified as risk factors for both OCC and OPC. In addition, human papilloma virus (HPV) is gaining its position as the main causal agent for OPC. Objective The objective of this study is to analyze the epidemiology of OCC and OPC in Canada. Methods Data pertaining to the year of diagnosis, the patient’s sex, age at the time of diagnosis, province/territory, city and postal code of oral cavity, and oropharyngeal malignancies diagnosed during 1992-2010 were extracted from the Canadian Cancer Registry and Le Registre Québécois du Cancer. Results In total, 2 68 OCC cases and 1 96 OPC cases were identified from 199 to 2010. Of those, 84.97% were oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 88.10% were oropharyngeal SCCs, and both had a significant male predominance. While oral cavity SCC incidence stabilized over the study period, oropharyngeal SCC continued to increase. Oral cavity SCC incidence increased with age, while oropharyngeal SCC incidence peaked in the 50- to 59-year age group. Detailed geographic distribution analysis of patients at the provincial/territorial, city, and postal code levels identified several patient clusters.

Negotiating the curve of a new narrative,"The central government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Hanoi's municipal authorities are enthusiastically embracing a series of plans and policies for the capital city to create a sustainable mega-city. This state imaginary privileges 'modern' mobilities, championing highways, a bus rapid transport system, and an elevated metro, while so called 'traditional' means of moving around the city such as motorbikes, bicycles, or cyclos are being strongly discouraged and increasingly marginalised. For example, Hanoi officials are implementing a step-wise ban on motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030, while the majority of the urban population travels by motorbike, with about five million motorbikes plying the city's streets. While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe ôm). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi's xe ôm drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe ôm drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security.

In this study, the dynamic response of these synthetic arterial substitutes to physiological pulsatile conditions is investigated in depth. Experiments were performed on a mock circulatory loop developed to replicate physiological pulsatile pressure and flow. Two different models of Dacron grafts (branched and straight) were tested at various heart rate conditions. Results are presented in terms of cyclic axisymmetric diameter changes, hysteretic loops of the pressure-diameter change, and viscoelastic parameters, such as loss factor and storage modulus that are identified from the hysteresis loop. The amplitude of cyclic diameter change of the Dacron graft was found to be always below 0.2% for all the heart rates considered (from 5 to 18 bpm). The loss factor of the Dacron graft slightly increased with the heart rate; almost no effect of the pulse rate was observed on the storage modulus, which was identified to be around 100 MPa. Both glycerol-water mixture (i.e. the blood analogue fluid) and saline solution were used in the circulatory loop and results did not present significant differences between the two cases. This shows that the effect of the shear load on the dynamic response of Dacron grafts is negligible.

A basic demand in such a geo-distributed data center system is to transfer bulk volumes of data from one data center to another. Geographic distribution and large delay-tolerance of such inter-data-center bulk data transfers provide cloud service providers opportunities to optimize the operating cost. Most existing studies on inter-data-center bulk data transfers focus on minimizing the network bandwidth cost. However, the energy-cost of the bulk data transfers, which also accounts for a large proportion of operating cost in the data centers, still remains unexplored. This is an important problem, especially in the multi-electricity-market environment, where the electricity price exhibits both spatial and temporal diversities. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of how to route and schedule inter-data-center bulk data transfers to minimize the energy-cost for geo-distributed data centers.

Numerical simulations based on the two-dimensional reactive Euler equations with a detailed hydrogen/oxygen chemistry model were first performed to observe key characteristics of cellular detonation wave diffraction and to obtain required input parameters for the model construction. The present numerical observations indicate that the transverse detonation stems from a location on the expansion wave front, and the horizontal distance from this initial location to the channel exit can be scaled by a constant multiplied by the detonation cell width for large deviation angles of the channel. The velocity of the transverse detonation basically equals the Chapman–Jouguet detonation wave velocity consisting of two orthogonal components: the expansion velocity of the diffracted wave front and the relative velocity to the diffracted wave front. The shape of the decoupled wave front is not affected by local explosion and thus can be predicted by the Chester–Chisnell–Whitham theory. Based on these numerical observations and the Chester–Chisnell–Whitham theory, a semi-analytical model is constructed to predict the wave trajectories as well as the distances of the wall reflection point for various deviation angles and initial pressures. The model prediction agrees with the corresponding numerical results. The model result shows that the distance of the wall reflection point varies from 1 to 2 multiples of the cell width with a minimal dependence on deviation angle, independent of the initial pressure. The trajectory calculated by the model is self-similar and determined by the horizontal distance of the initial location. The dimensionless trajectories divided by the horizontal distance are coincident for different initial pressures.",2020-01-01,Shock Waves,https://openalex.org/V188738898,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00193-019-00904-4,13,27,30,1,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2946293284,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00193-019-00904-4,journal-article,2946293284

Although we have hypothesized and proposed 41 elements, which make up the model's five domains, we have yet to assess the external validity of the PDDM's elements by expert consensus. Research objectives This study aimed to reach consensus among experts regarding the different elements that should be included in each domain of the PDDM model. Relevance The PDDM may assist clinicians and researchers in the delivery of targeted care and ultimately enhance treatment outcomes in LBP. Methods Using a modified Delphi survey, a two-round online questionnaire was administered to a group of experts in musculoskeletal pain management. Participants were asked to rate the relevance of each element proposed within the model. Participants were also invited to add and rate new elements. Consensus was defined by a greater than or equal to 75% level of agreement. Results A total of 4 (round 1) and 3 (round 2) participants completed the survey. Following the first round, 3 of 41 of the former model elements reached consensus, and 1 new elements were proposed and later rated in the second round.

Specifically, we introduce the concept of basic psychological need sacrifice and suggest it is distinguishable from the sacrifice of maintenance and leisure activities. We found that sacrificing basic psychological needs had enduring affective and self-regulatory costs through the effect of increased need frustration over the academic year. Moreover, we found that the sacrifice of psychological needs stemmed from controlling motivational processes, such as extrinsic life aspirations, controlled career goal motivation (assessed at the start of the academic year) and controlled motivation for sacrificing (assessed midyear along with the three types of sacrifices).

Heterogeneity of HLA-DR+SIRPα + mononuclear phagocytes [MNPs], including macrophages [MΦ], monocyte-derived [Mono] cells, and dendritic cells [DCs], was reported in gut tissue but not yet investigated in mesenteric lymph nodes [MLNs] of IBD patients. We here compared the phenotype, function, and molecular profile of HLA-DR+SIRPα + MNPs in CD and UC MLNs. Methods Cell distribution, morphology, immune function, and transcriptomic [bulk RNAseq] and high-dimensional protein expression profiles [CyTOF] of HLA-DR+SIRPα + MNPs were examined in MLNs of UC [n = 14], CD [n = 35], and non-IBD [n = 12] patients. Results Elevated frequencies of CD14+CD64+CD163+ [Mono/MΦ-like] MNPs displaying monocyte/MΦ morphology and phagocytic function were a distinct feature of UC MLNs. In CD, the proportion of CD14-CD64-CD163- [DC-like] cells was augmented relative to Mono/MΦ-like cells; DC-like cells drove naïve T cell proliferation, Th polarisation, and Th1 TCM plasticity. Gene expression profile corroborated the nature of DC-like cells, best represented by BTLA, SERPINF, IGJ and, of Mono/MΦ-like cells, defined by CD163, MARCO, MAFB, CD300E, S100A9 expression. CyTOF analysis showed that CD123+ plasmacytoid cells predominated over conventional DCs in DC-like cells. Four CD163+ clusters were revealed in Mono/MΦ-like cells, two of which were enriched in MARCO-CD68dimHLA-DRdim monocyte-like cells and MARCOhiCD68hiHLA-DRhi Mɸ, whose proportion increased in UC relative to CD.

The evolution of beak morphology in the Darwin's finches in response to competition for seed resources is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. The seeds of Tribulus cistoides are an important food source for the largest ground finch species (Geospiza fortis, G. magnirostris, and G. conirostris) in dry months, and the hard spiny morphology of the fruits is a potent agent of selection that drives contemporary evolutionary change in finch beak morphology. Although the effects of these interactions on finches are well known, how seed predation affects the ecology and evolution of the plants is poorly understood. Here we examine whether seed predation by Darwin's finches affects the ecology and evolution of T. cistoides. We ask whether the intensity of seed predation and the strength of natural selection by finches on fruit defense traits vary among populations, islands, years, or with varying finch community composition (i.e., the presence/absence of the largest beaked species, which feed on T. cistoides most easily). We then further test whether T. cistoides fruit defenses have diverged among islands in response to spatial variation in finch communities. We addressed these questions by examining seed predation by finches in 3 populations of T. cistoides over  yr. Our study reveals three key results. First, Darwin's finches strongly influence T. cistoides seed survival, whereby seed predation varies with differences in finch community composition among islands and in response to interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Second, finches impose phenotypic selection on T. cistoides fruit morphology, whereby smaller and harder fruits with longer or more spines exhibited higher seed survival. Variation in finch community composition and precipitation also explains variation in phenotypic selection on fruit defense traits. Third, variation in the number of spines on fruits among islands is consistent with divergent phenotypic selection imposed by variation in finch community composition among islands. These results suggest that Darwin's finches and T. cistoides are experiencing an ongoing coevolutionary arms race, and that the strength of this coevolution varies in space and time.",2020-02-01,Ecological Monographs,https://openalex.org/V201386569,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1392,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2974410073,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1392,journal-article,2974410073

Since the 1,3,5-triazine molecule has significant biological activity, we thought that the development of new metallo-chemotherapeutic agents involving the triazine moiety might be of interest. With this in mind, we have now synthesized several mixed-ligand transition metal complexes with the 2-amino-4,6-dithio-1,3,5-triazine (Hat) ligand that also contain 2,2'bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as a secondary ligand. On the basis of various spectral [IR, NMR (1H, 13C, 31P), UV–vis and EI-mass] measurements and other physical analyses (molar conductivity, elemental analysis and TGA), two modes of coordination are proposed for the Hat ligand. The first is a neutral bidentate mode through either the amino-N(2) and cyclic-N(3) atoms or the thione-S(4) and cyclic-N(3) atoms. The second mode is a mononegative bidentate one via the deprotonated cyclic-N(1) atom and either the amino-N(2) or the thione-S(6) atom. The dissociation constant of Hat, as well as the stoichiometries and the formation constants of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Pd(II), Pt(II), [M(L)Cl2] (L = bpy, 2PPh3) and Ag(I) complexes in saline solution (pH 7.4), have been determined using both Job's and the molar ratio methods. The calf thymus (CT-DNA)-binding properties of several of the complexes have been determined using UV–vis spectroscopy.

The pipe under consideration discharges fluid downwards, which accumulates in a relatively large tank, and then flows upwards through a generally shorter annular region surrounding the pipe. Thus, the internal and external flows are interdependent and in opposite directions. A practical application of this system may be found in solution mining processes for brine production, and in the subsequent usage of the salt-mined caverns for hydrocarbon storage. The equation of motion is derived using the extended Hamilton’s principle to third-order accuracy with a separate derivation of the fluid-related forces associated with the internal and external flows. The equation is discretized using Galerkin’s scheme and solved via the pseudo-arclength continuation method and a direct time integration technique. Two pipes of different dimensions and materials are considered in this study; the stability of these pipes is investigated with increasing flow velocity. Also, the influence of varying the length and tightness of the annular region on the dynamical behaviour of the pipes is explored theoretically. The predictions of the proposed model are compared to experimental observations from the literature for systems with the same parameters as those considered in this paper, as well as to predictions of an earlier linear theory. The results obtained are in excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement with the experimental observations. Furthermore, this model predicts the frequencies of oscillation more accurately than linear theory.",2020-01-01,International Journal of Non-linear Mechanics,https://openalex.org/V152063775,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2019.103290,103290,103290,118,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975581682,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2019.103290,journal-article,2975581682

Findings are presented along the dimensions of urban resilience detailed in the City Resilience Framework (ARUP/Rockefeller Foundation): Health and Wellbeing, Economy and Society, Infrastructure and Environment, and Leadership and Strategy (which we present as a cross‐cutting theme). While some enabling and impeding factors in implementation are associated with a specific dimension, others are common to all three. Across dimensions, we find that transparent, inclusive and supportive governance reduces the risk of negative impact that resilience implementation will have on communities. Conflicting priorities of managing risk and meeting short‐term needs are found to diminish the potential for transformative resilience action. Integrating risk into planning appears as a promising strategy in all dimensions of resilience.

MDE promotes the creation of domain-specific metamodels, but without proper reuse mechanisms, model transformations need to be developed from scratch for each new metamodel. In this paper, our goal is to understand whether transformation reuse across metamodels is needed by the community, evaluate its current state, identify practical needs and propose promising lines for further research. For this purpose, we first report on a survey to understand the reuse approaches used currently in practice and the needs of the community. Then, we propose a classification of reuse techniques based on a feature model and compare a sample of specific approaches—model types, concepts, a-posteriori typing, multilevel modeling, typing requirement models, facet-oriented modeling, mapping operators, constraint-based model types, and design patterns for model transformations—based on this feature model and a common example.

It offers a straightforward factor-income approach to calculating payments for ecosystem services (PES) to livestock producers who reduce or suspend grazing for the purpose of grassland restoration. Our approach requires only cross-sectional farm-level accounting data and is thus feasible where policies have either not yet been applied or specialized data is sparse, as is common in many developing regions. We apply and validate this approach with empirical analysis of sheep and goat herders in the Ulanqab prefecture in Inner Mongolia, China where herders currently receive payments in exchange for reduced grazing intensity on vulnerable land. However, observed stocking rates are still commonly higher than recommended. Our results suggest payments are currently insufficient to offset the financial loss incurred by herders who reduce their grazing intensity, a finding consistent with previous studies. Using an approach we refer to as the factor-income method, we estimate and validate new levels of recommended payments. This demonstrates how future payments could be tailored to meet the financial needs of individual herding communities using basic farm-level data.",2020-02-01,Land Use Policy,https://openalex.org/V80485027,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104352,104352,104352,91,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990260319,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104352,journal-article,2990260319

The best known of them is the Strange Lake pluton (Canada) with a resource of 20 Mt grading 1.44 wt% REE2O3, of which ~50% are heavy rare-earth oxides. In this paper, we examine the various processes that are likely to be responsible for the hyper-enrichment of the HFSE, starting with the generation of a parental magma through a very low degree of partial melting of a mantle plume or a metasomatically enriched mantle, in both cases, below a continental crust (continental rift). We trace the evolution of this magma (olivine nephelinite) through fractional crystallisation of olivine and clinopyroxene followed by plagioclase, K-rich alkali feldspar and arfvedsonite to the final residues of hyper-enriched HFSE granitic pegmatites. In so doing, we show that at least two additional steps are essential to the process of HFSE enrichment. The first of these is the abrupt termination of plagioclase crystallisation prior to the final consumption of Ca or assimilation of a Ca source and the resulting exsolution of an immiscible Ca-fluoride melt that sequesters the LREE and Y. The second of these steps is prolonged crystallisation of arfvedsonite, which delays saturation of the magma with an aqueous phase and ensures the development of an agpaitic assemblage of Na-bearing HFSE minerals (e.g., Na-zirconosilicates and Na-titanosilicates). Finally, we show that saturation of the magma with an aqueous‑carbonic fluid, which evolves to a very acidic composition, is an essential ingredient in the ‘recipe’ for the formation of an economic A-type granite-hosted HFSE deposit.",2020-03-01,Lithos,https://openalex.org/V107629180,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105300,105300,105300,356-357,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990410564,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105300,journal-article,2990410564

Some of these concerns have been alleviated by using treated wastewater (TWW) as an alternative water resource for applications such as irrigation and industrial cooling. To achieve optimal and equitable water resource allocation amongst stakeholders, a novel risk-based multi-objective TWW allocation optimization framework was developed to model stakeholders’ conflicting objectives and to consider potential resource losses linked to uncertainty. The proposed framework was tested to determine the TWW allocation policy best suited to the eastern portion of the province of Tehran, Iran, for the planning horizon of 2031. The results indicate that first, the proposed model provides a reasonable sharing policy to effectively resolve conflicts between involved stakeholders. Second, the solutions are sensitive to the confidence level of the risk model during the optimization process, and hence, one has to be conservative in assigning a confidence value when using this framework. Third, the obtained compromise solution differs from the most preferred solution of each stakeholder, which is consistent with the nature of bargaining problems. Lastly, shortage occurred when trying to meet the demand of the municipal sector (MS), and therefore, bankruptcy procedures and social choice rules (SCR) were only applicable to the MS share of TWW. Results of SCRs revealed that the Constrained Equal Award method is preferred for the provision of a socially acceptable sharing scenario in the presence of a water shortage. Overall, the efficiency and efficacy of the developed equity-based model to resolve conflicts related to resource allocation were confirmed.",2020-04-10,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119766,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995608300,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119766,journal-article,2995608300

Nuclear fuel assemblies are composed of long slender tubes, filled with uranium pellets that are bundled together by periodic support provided by spacer grids. Spacer grids are square structures used to increase thermal mixing in the core and provide support to the fuel rods and guide tubes allowing for the installation and removal of nuclear fuel rods. Nevertheless, spacer grids constitute a nonlinear flexible boundary condition experiencing friction forces and impacts complicating the dynamics of the fuel rod-spacer grid system. In order to improve safety margins in the design of nuclear fuel assemblies, it is of great interest to understand the nonlinear behavior at the interface of the spacer grids with the fuel rods, investigating the complexity due to the nonlinear evolution of the system stiffness and damping properties. In particular, the effect of the constant evolution of the vibration amplitude as a function of the change of the excitation forces on the dynamics of the fuel rod response is still undetermined. Experiments were carried out in quiescent water and in air to understand the nonlinear vibration response of a single zirconium fuel rod supported by spacer grids. The vibration response under a step-sine harmonic excitation at different force amplitude levels in the frequency neighborhood of the fundamental mode was measured. The response of the rod displayed nonlinear phenomena such as the shift of the resonant frequencies, multiple solutions with some instabilities (jumps) and hysteresis, and a weak one-to-one internal resonance. Tests were performed on an empty rod and on a rod filled with tungsten pellets representative of nuclear fuel. The pellets were let free to move and were subsequently blocked axially to reproduce the effect of the beginning-of-life constraint in operational nuclear plants. The experimental data were processed by means of a simplified identification procedure to extract the damping parameters of the vibrating system. The equivalent viscous damping is found to increase and to be a function of the level of excitation and of the peak vibration amplitude.",2020-05-01,Nuclear Engineering and Design,https://openalex.org/V102681701,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110503,110503,110503,361,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999016047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110503,journal-article,2999016047

A standard approach is to assume that the process of interest follows a Gaussian Process with some mean and (valid) covariance functions. It is common to model the covariance function as the product between a variance parameter, and a correlation function which is a function of the Euclidean distance between locations. This implies that the distribution of the process is unchanged when the origin of the index set is translated, and the process is invariant under rotation about the origin; that is the process is stationary and isotropic or homogeneous. However, the assumption of stationarity and isotropy (homogeneity) rarely holds in practice. Commonly, the correlation structures of such processes are influenced by local characteristics resulting in different behaviors in neighborhoods of different spatial locations.

In both soils, root and shoot growth declined linearly as the concentration of AgNPs increased. Barley had higher Ag bioconcentration values when grown in the OECD soil than in the Delacour soil. Silver bioavailability was greater in the OECD soil due to its physicochemical properties, such as low calcium concentration and acidic pH, relative to the Delacour soil.

The coatings, made from the two different powders, were distinctly different in terms of porosity content and hardness. Sliding wear tests were performed at different normal loads on both Ti6Al4V coatings. Despite low porosity and high hardness, irregular powder (IP) deposited coatings showed higher wear rates compared to spherical powder (SP) deposited coatings. In case of IP coatings, abrasive ploughing by the wear debris led to high wear rates, whereas presence of porosity in SP coatings, entrapped the wear debris generated during sliding and decreased the wear rate. Increase in normal load led to a decrease in wear rate and CoF in both coatings. The decrease in wear rate was due to tribo-oxidation in IP coatings whereas the combined effect of entrapment of debris along with tribo-oxidation resulted in much lower wear rates in SP coatings. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the third bodies filled in the pores consisted of highly deformed material with ultrafine grain microstructure and micron sized particles from the counterface while the wear track had comparatively coarse grain microstructure.

In mice, activins signal via SMAD3, SMAD4, and FOXL2 to regulate transcription of the FSHβ subunit (Fshb) gene. Gonadotrope-specific deletion of Foxl2, alone or in combination with Smad4, renders mice FSH-deficient. Whether human FSHB expression is similarly regulated is not known. Here, we used a combination of transgenic and conditional knockout mouse strains to assess the roles of activins, FOXL2, and SMAD4 in regulation of the human FSHB gene. First, we cultured pituitaries from mice harboring a human FSHB transgene (hFSHB mice) and measured both murine Fshb and human FSHB messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in response to exogenous activins or two antagonists of endogenous activin-like signaling (follistatin-288 and SB431542). Both murine Fshb and human FSHB expression were stimulated by activins and reduced by the inhibitors. Next, we analyzed human FSHB expression in hFSHB mice carrying floxed Foxl2 and Smad4 alleles. Cre-mediated ablation of FOXL2 and SMAD4 strongly reduced basal and activin-stimulated murine Fshb and human FSHB expression in cultured pituitaries. Finally, the hFSHB transgene was previously shown to rescue FSH production and fertility in Fshb knockout mice.

The purpose of this study was to establish preoperative clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic, and cytological variables, which can differentiate NIFTP from FVPTC. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients from a single institution evaluated between January 201 and December 2017. 20 adult patients underwent lobectomy or total thyroidectomy for a FVPTC during that period. Each patient’s medical chart was reviewed and information on pre-operative variables was recorded. An expert pathologist reviewed all surgical specimens and reclassified a subset of FVPTC as NIFTP according to the specific criteria. Results Overall, 4 patients were included in the NIFTP group and 15 in the non-NIFTP group. Mean age was 50. years in the NIFTP group and 50. in the non-NIFTP group. Most patients were female (86.4% (38/44) in the NIFTP group vs 79.8% (127/159) in the non-NIFTP group). More patients underwent lobectomy in the NIFTP group (50% (22/44) vs 16.4% (26/159) in the non-NIFTP group, p = &lt; 0.0001). Less patients received radioactive iodine in the NIFTP group (31.8% (14/44) vs 52.2% (83/159) in the non-NIFTP group, p = 0.0177). Preoperative thyroglobulin levels were lower in NIFTP patients (Median 25.5 mcg/L +/− 67.8 vs 76.06 mcg/L +/− 119.8 in Non-NIFTP, p = 0.0104). NIFTP nodules were smaller (Mean size 22.97 mm +/− 12.3 vs 25.8 mm +/− 11.2 for non-NIFTP, p = 0.0448) and more often solid than non-NIFTP (93.2% (41/44) vs 74.8% (119/159) for non-NIFTP, p = 0.0067). 2017 ACR TIRADS nodule category of 1–4 on ultrasound had a negative predictive value and a sensitivity of 100% for NIFTP. ROC Curve Analysis demonstrated that a preoperative thyroglobulin level of 31.3 mcg/L had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 62.5% to differentiate NIFTP from non-NIFTP cancers. Conclusion Lower preoperative thyroglobulin levels, smaller nodule size, solid texture and 2017 ACR TIRADS Category of 1–4 are more strongly associated with NIFTP than FVPTC and can favour less invasive surgical options such as lobectomy.",2020-01-02,Journal of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery,https://openalex.org/V4210233012,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-019-0397-9,,,,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013122178,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-019-0397-9,journal-article,3013122178

Whether these results can be replicated in a real-world population with long-term follow-up or varies over time is unknown. We sought to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of CA in reducing the incidence of all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, stroke, and major bleeding in AF–HF patients. Methods and results In a cohort of patients newly diagnosed with AF–HF in Quebec, Canada (2000–2017), CA patients were matched 1:2 to controls on time and frequency of hospitalizations. Confounders were controlled for using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Multivariable Cox models adjusted for the presence of cardiac electronic implantable devices and medication use during follow-up, and the effect of time since CA was modelled with B-splines. For non-fatal outcomes, the Lunn–McNeil approach was used to account for the competing risk of death. Among 10 93 AF–HF patients, 45 underwent CA and were matched to 89 controls. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 years, CA was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.2–0.7)], but no difference in stroke or major bleeding. The hazard of HF rehospitalization for CA patients, relative to non-CA patients, varied with time since CA (P = 0.01), with a reduction in HF rehospitalizations until approximately 3 years post-CA. Conclusion Compared with matched non-CA patients, CA was associated with a long-term reduction in all-cause mortality and a reduction in HF rehospitalizations until 3 years post-CA.",2020-05-01,Europace,https://openalex.org/V46732370,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa036,739,747,22,5,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013811414,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa036,journal-article,3013811414

Social learning can be beneficial for calf performance and welfare, and pair-housing and companionship on pasture have been proposed as management practices to develop efficient foraging behaviour. Yet, the interaction between early housing and the experience of a companion on the development of grazing and ruminating behaviour is unknown. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of early housing and experience of a companion on heifer behaviour during their first grazing season. The experiment was designed as a two by two factorial with six replicates per factorial combination repeated over two seasons. In each season, 1 focal heifers were single- or pair-housed before the experiment began. At the start of each trial season, the focal heifers were placed on pasture for the first time and paired with an unknown companion heifer of similar bodyweight and age. Half of the focal heifers were paired with a naïve grazer companion and the other half with an experienced grazer companion. The experiment started when the newly formed pairs of heifers were placed on pasture (day 0). Posture and behaviour (grazing, ruminating and others) were recorded during the morning and afternoon for both heifers using scan sampling every two minutes for six hours per day on days 1, 2, 3, 1 and 1 after pasture placement. Data were analyzed separately for focal and companion heifers, using generalized linear mixed models, with pen nested in the model as the experimental unit and days on pasture as a repeated measure. The early housing and the experience of a companion had a synergistic effect over time on the percentage of time that focal heifers were ruminating (early-housing: P = 0.048; and companion experience: P = 0.049) but not grazing (early-housing: P = 0.40; and companion experience: P = 0.27). Pair-housed heifers placed on pasture with experienced heifers were ruminating more (14.1 ± 1.5%) than single-housed heifers with naïve heifers (9.8 ± 1.5%; P = 0.02). Over the duration of the experiment, the patterns of grazing and rumination behaviour during the morning and afternoon were similar between focal and companion heifers. These results suggest that early socialization and grazing with an experienced companion (i.e. social model) influence ruminating behaviour on pasture in first grazing season heifers, probably due to social facilitation.",2020-05-01,Applied Animal Behaviour Science,https://openalex.org/V179500637,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2020.104993,104993,104993,226,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017797888,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2020.104993,journal-article,3017797888

The atlas is a 6 μm isotropic image volume composed of 25 coronal slices with 7 manually delineated structures and substructures. The atlas was developed using Pydpiper image registration pipeline to create an average brain image of 4 four-month-old male and female Fischer 344 rats. Slices in the average brain image were then manually segmented, individually and bilaterally, on the basis of image contrast in conjunction with Paxinos and Watson’s (2007) stereotaxic rat brain atlas. Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation of regional volumes) are reported for each brain region across the sample used to generate the atlas, and a statistical comparison of a chosen subset of regional brain volumes between male and female rats is presented. On average, the coefficient of variation of regional brain volumes across all rats in our sample was 4%, with no individual brain region having a coefficient of variation greater than 13%. A full description of methods used, as well as the atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found on Zenodo at www.zenodo.org/record/3700210 .

There is emerging evidence that implicates neutrophils in cancer progression. Alterations of neutrophil counts and NLR during treatment may reflect a change in oncologic outcome that is more important than baseline values. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic role of NLR changes during the treatment trajectory of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.NLR values of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery between 200 and 201 were measured at baseline and in the late postoperative period. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary outcome was pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.33 patients were included; mean age was 65.6 years, and 82% were male. Most patients had cT3 (74.8%), cN-positive (59.7%) disease. Two-thirds (65.2%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy The independent predictors of OS were pathological N-stage, size of primary tumor, and delta NLR (late - baseline NLR). Patients with persistently elevated NLR did worse than those with decreasing NLR trends between baseline and postoperative time points (3-year OS 43.4% versus 71.3%, p < 0.0001, 3-year DFS 29.7% versus 61.9%, p < 0.0001).

This study aimed to identify multimorbidity patterns and their association with physical performance among older Chinese adults. Methods: Individuals aged ≥6 years from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011–2015 (N = 10,112) were included. Physical performance was measured by maximum grip strength (kg) and average gait speed (m/s) categorized as fast (&gt;0.8 m/s), median (&gt;0.6–0.8 m/s), and slow (≤0.6 m/s). Multimorbidity patterns were explored using exploratory factor analysis. Generalized estimating equation was conducted. Results: Four multimorbidity patterns were identified: cardio–metabolic, respiratory, mental–sensory, and visceral–arthritic. An increased number of chronic conditions was associated with decreased normalized grip strength (NGS). Additionally, the highest quartile of factor scores for cardio–metabolic (β = −0.06; 95% Confidence interval (CI) = −0.07, −0.05), respiratory (β = −0.03; 95% CI = −0.05, −0.02), mental–sensory (β = −0.04; 95% CI = −0.05, −0.03), and visceral–arthritic (β = −0.04; 95% CI = −0.05, −0.02) patterns were associated with lower NGS compared with the lowest quartile. Participants with ≥ chronic conditions were 2.06 times more likely to have a slow gait speed. Furthermore, the odds ratios for the highest quartile of factor scores of four patterns with slow gait speed compared with the lowest quartile ranged from 1.26–2.01. Conclusion: Multimorbidity was related to worse physical performance, and multimorbidity patterns were differentially associated with physical performance. A shift of focus from single conditions to the requirements of a complex multimorbid population was needed for research, clinical guidelines, and health-care services.

The MAP is a longitudinal study that follows active case ﬁles of mid-adolescents in a large urban child protective services (CPS) system. The MAP is a unique opportunity to collect information from teens about their physical health (e.g., sleep quality), mental health (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) and cognitive style (e.g., attention, memory). The MAP study samples the population of CPS teens on questions that are used in provincial teen surveys, allowing for points of comparison to non-CPS teens. The MAP tracks youth development over 2.5 years. Although the MAP currently has a very small number of Aboriginal teens, the responses of these teens may focus practitioner and researcher attention to priority areas for further research. This includes the investigation of how some research issues, such as maltreatment history, personal safety, relationship to primary CPS worker and suicidal ideation, may be cross-informative. It is known that teen risk behaviours cluster together, but it is important to understand the relationships among these variables.

The parent generation seeks to cultivate pro‐social values in their children as this would improve their material well‐being when they grow up as cooperative adults. I show that communities endowed with more productive resources have a stronger incentive to teach their children social cooperation. Thus, there is a correlation between a village's level of material well‐being and villagers’ steady‐state level of pro‐socialness. When the cost of moral education is directly dependent on the parent generation's level of pro‐socialness, the multiplicity of steady states may emerge. If a community's initial level of pro‐socialness is high, the system will reach an interior steady state; in contrast, if this initial level is low, eventually the level of pro‐socialness will approach zero in the long run.

Here, we present a method of restriction to an indication, which we call extreme restriction, to reduce confounding in such studies. Methods As a case study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). PPI use has been associated with increased HCAP risk, but this association likely results from confounding by indication due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Using the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we compared the risk of HCAP within 180 days between PPI users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) users in an ACNU cohort using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-fixed exposure definition adjusted for high-dimensional propensity score deciles. We then performed the same analysis on an extremely-restricted cohort of incident nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users, some of whom received PPIs for prophylaxis. Because PPIs were given as prophylaxis in this population, confounding due to GERD should be limited. We compared effect estimates between ACNU and restricted cohorts to evaluate confounding in both analyses. Results In the ACNU cohort, PPIs were associated with an increased risk of HCAP (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.47), but this association was not present in the restricted cohort (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.49).

We compared 14 Carex (Cyperaceae) species in a factorial experiment (unshaded/shaded × sufficient/insufficient P) to analyze how changes in the network of allometric scaling relationships among LES traits influenced growth under favorable and resource-limited conditions. Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA) shifted the scaling relationships among LES traits expressed per unit area vs mass in ways that helped to sustain growth under resource limitation. Increases in area-normalized photosynthetic capacity and foliar nitrogen (N) were correlated with increased growth, offsetting losses associated with mass-normalized dark respiration and foliar N. These shifts increased the contributions to growth associated with photosynthetic N-use efficiency and the N : P ratio.

However, due to the ordered phases formed in the microstructure, the room-temperature ductility (formability) of this material is extremely low. It is essentially not possible to process this steel by conventional cold rolling. In this study, an Fe-6.5 wt% Si grain-oriented electrical steel was processed through strip casting (also known as twin-roll casting), hot rolling, warm rolling, cold rolling, primary and secondary annealing. The effect of hot rolling reduction rate (12–40%) on the microstructure, crystallographic texture and magnetic properties of the final steel sheets was investigated. The results showed that hot rolling increased the area fraction of the Goss ({1 1 0}〈0 0 1〉) grains, reduced the grain size, and promoted the precipitation of fine second-phase particles. After warm rolling, cold rolling and primary annealing, the recrystallized microstructure was the finest if the hot-rolling reduction rate was the highest (40%). After secondary annealing, the steel with the largest hot rolling reduction rate (40%) showed the most apparent abnormal grain growth, leading to the formation of the Goss texture. As a result, the magnetic flux density and the magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN) also showed the largest values among all the samples. On the other hand, those with lower hot-rolling reduction rates (12–32%) showed no or less abnormal grain growth during secondary recrystallization, which resulted in lower magnetic flux density and weaker magnetic Barkhausen noise. Increasing the amount of hot rolling reduction was thus able to promote abnormal grain growth during secondary recrystallization, and optimize the magnetic properties of the steel.",2020-01-15,Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials,https://openalex.org/V3649266,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165755,165755,165755,494,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2971274943,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165755,journal-article,2971274943

We sought to determine if simple cardiac risk scores are associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease including carotid wall volume (CWV), carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), and silent brain infarction (SBI). Methods and results A total of 759 adults with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) underwent risk factor assessment and a non-contrast enhanced MRI of the carotid arteries and brain using a standardized protocol in a population-based cohort recruited between 201 and 2018. The non-lab-based INTERHEART risk score (IHRS) was calculated in all participants; the Framingham Risk Score was calculated in a subset who provided blood samples (n = 3889). The association between these risk scores and MRI measures of CWV, carotid IPH, and SBI was determined. The mean age of the cohort was 5 (8.9) years, 55% were women.

Objectives This study sought perspectives from health professionals with clinical/research expertise in chronic breathlessness on priority issues in chronic breathlessness explanations and research. Methods Authors (n = 74) of publications specific to chronic breathlessness were invited to a three-round Delphi survey. Responses to open-ended questions (Round 1 What is important to: include/avoid when explaining chronic breathlessness; prioritize in research?) were transformed to Likert scale (1–9) items for rating in subsequent rounds. A priori consensus was defined as ≥70% of respondents rating an item as important (Likert rating 7–9) and interquartile range ≤2. Results Of the 3 Round 1 respondents (nine countries, five professional disciplines), 2 (77%) completed Rounds  and 3. Sixty-three items met consensus (include n = 28; avoid n = 9; research n = 26). Explanations of chronic breathlessness should use patient-centered communication; acknowledge the distress, variability, and importance of this sensation; emphasize current management principles; clarify maladaptive beliefs and expectations; and avoid moral culpability and inappropriate reassurance. Research priorities included the need 1) for a comprehensive understanding of breathlessness science; 2) to optimize, explore, and develop effective interventions, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological; and 3) determine effective models of care including strategies for education and training of health professionals and people caring for, or living with, chronic breathlessness.

The extension of elongated body theory to large-amplitude rotations of the plate mid-plane along with Bollay's nonlinear wing theory is employed in order to express the fluid-related forces acting on the plate, while retaining all time-dependent terms in both modelling and numerical simulations; the unsteady fluid forces due to vortex shedding are not included. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with exact kinematics and inextensibility is employed to derive the nonlinear partial integro-differential equation governing the dynamics of the plate. Discretization in space is carried out via a conventional Galerkin scheme using the linear mode-shapes of a cantilevered beam in vacuum. The pseudo-arclength continuation technique is adapted to construct bifurcation diagrams in terms of the flow velocity, in order to gain insight into the stability and post-critical behaviour of the system. Integration in time is conducted using Gear's backward differentiation formula. The sensitivity of the nonlinear response of the system to different parameters such as the aspect ratio, mass ratio, initial inclination of the flag, and viscous drag coefficient is investigated through extensive numerical simulations. It is shown that for flags of small aspect ratio the undeflected static equilibrium is stable prior to a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. For flags of sufficiently large aspect ratio, however, the first instability encountered is a supercritical Hopf bifurcation giving rise to flapping motion around the undeflected static equilibrium; increasing the flow velocity further, the flag then displays flapping motions around deflected static equilibria, which later lead to fully-deflected static states at even higher flow velocities. The results exposed in this study help understand the dynamics of the inverted-flag problem in the limit of inviscid flow theory.",2020-02-17,Journal of Sound and Vibration,https://openalex.org/V99182027,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115048,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985120690,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115048,journal-article,2985120690

More recently, other members of the TGFbeta superfamily, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), were reported to regulate FSH synthesis. Activins and BMPs independently and synergistically stimulate transcription of the FSHbeta subunit (Fshb) gene in immortalized gonadotrope-like cells. Both ligands can signal via the activin receptor type IIA (ACVR2A) to regulate FSH synthesis in vitro. In vivo, global Acvr2a knockout mice exhibit a 60% reduction in circulating FSH relative to wild-type animals, suggesting that activins, BMPs, or related ligands might signal through additional type II receptors to regulate FSH in vivo. Although the leading candidates are ACVR2B and the BM type II receptor (BMPR2), only the latter mediates activin or BMP induction of Fshb transcription in vitro. Here, we generated mice carrying a loss of function mutation in Bmpr2 specifically in gonadotropes. Puberty onset, estrous cyclicity, and reproductive organ weights were similar between control and conditional knockout females. Serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) and pituitary expression of Fshb and the LHbeta subunit (Lhb) were similarly unaffected by the gene deletion in both sexes. These results suggest that BMPR2 might not play a necessary role in FSH synthesis or secretion in vivo or that another type II receptor, such as ACVR2A, can fully compensate for its absence. These data also further contribute to the emerging concept that BMPs may not be physiological regulators of FSH in vivo.",2020-03-13,Biology of Reproduction,https://openalex.org/V130598054,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioz206,639,646,102,3,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987934037,https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioz206,journal-article,2987934037

BMAA is a neurotoxin in mammals. Its ingestion may be linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, namely the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism dementia complex, based on epidemiological evidence from regions where cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms occur frequently. In controlled environments, cyanobacteria produce BMAA in response to ecophysiological cues such as nutrient availability, which may explain the elevated BMAA concentrations in freshwater environments that receive nutrient-rich agricultural runoff. This critical review paper summarizes what is known about how BMAA supports ecophysiological functions like nitrogen metabolism, photosyntheis and provides a competitive advantage to cyanobacteria in controlled and natural environments. We explain how BMAA production affected competitive interactions among the N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing populations in a freshwater cyanobacterial bloom that was stimulated by nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural landscape. Better control of nutrients in agricultural fields is an excellent strategy to avoid the negative environmental consequences and public health concerns related to BMAA production.",2020-03-01,Water Research,https://openalex.org/V52566953,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115335,115335,115335,170,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991594250,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115335,journal-article,2991594250

Grb10 is also a substrate for the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex  (mTORC1) that mediates its feedback inhibition on phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. To characterize the function of Grb10 and its regulation by mTORC1 in human muscle, primary skeletal muscle cells were isolated from healthy lean young men and then induced to differentiate into myotubes. Knockdown of Grb10 enhanced insulin-induced PI3K/Akt signaling and glucose uptake in myotubes, reinforcing the notion underlying its function as a negative regulator of insulin action in human muscle. The increased insulin responsiveness in Grb10-silenced myotubes was associated with a higher abundance of the insulin receptor. Furthermore, insulin and amino acids independently and additively stimulated phosphorylation of Grb10 at Ser476. However, acute inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin blocked Grb10 Ser476 phosphorylation and repressed a negative-feedback loop on PI3K/Akt signaling that increased myotube responsiveness to insulin. Chronic rapamycin treatment reduced Grb10 protein abundance in conjunction with increased insulin receptor protein levels. Based on these findings, we propose that mTORC1 controls PI3K/Akt signaling through modulation of insulin receptor abundance by Grb10. These findings have potential implications for obesity-linked insulin resistance, as well as clinical use of mTORC1 inhibitors.",2020-02-01,American Journal of Physiology-endocrinology and Metabolism,https://openalex.org/V196637695,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00025.2019,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2993016469,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00025.2019,journal-article,2993016469

Following salt precipitation, the elastic wave velocities decreased significantly, the dynamic Young’s modulus of the rock decreased, and the dynamic Poisson’s ratio increased.

This exploratory study examines user preferences with regard to virtual reference services and factors that account for these preferences from a different vantage point than previous literature by relying on semi-structured interviews with users. Using NVivo qualitative data analysis software, I coded interview transcripts and applied grounded theory to identify preferences from among email to the library, email to a liaison librarian, chat and texting. In terms of virtual reference methods currently offered by the library, participants indicated a general preference for chat, highlighting the importance of this service. However, participants were reluctant to use chat on mobile phones, their most used communication technology. Findings also show that relational aspects are major factors influencing participants’ choice of communication. Specifically, participants expressed a preference for modes of communication that are personal, informal, perceived as safe and secure and conversational. Participants expressed reservations for texting due to ambiguity about response times, the perception of the method as being too personal and safety and security concerns. Participants were reluctant to use email in general due to response times and its level of formality, but valued email with their liaison librarian for its level of personalness and the level of expertise they felt that the liaison librarian could offer.

Comparable to a cylindrical ionization chamber (IC) in terms of utility and usability, Aerrow has been developed for the purpose of accurately measuring absorbed dose to water in the clinic with a minimum disruption to the existing clinical workflow. To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of graphite calorimetry to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiotherapy. Methods Based on a previously numerically optimized and experimentally validated design, an Aerrow prototype capable of isothermal operation was constructed in-house. Graphite-to-water dose conversions as well as magnetic field perturbation factors were calculated using Monte Carlo, while heat transfer and mass impurity corrections and uncertainties were assessed analytically. Reference dose measurements were performed in the absence and presence of a B = 1.5 T magnetic field using Aerrow in the 7 MV FFF photon beam of an Elekta MRI-linac and were directly compared to the results obtained using two calibrated reference-class IC types. The feasibility of performing solid phantom-based dosimetry with Aerrow and the possible influence of clearance gaps is also investigated by performing reference-type dosimetry measurements for multiple rotational positions of the detector and comparing the results to those obtained in water. Results In the absence of the B-field, as well as in the parallel orientation while in the presence of the B-field, the absorbed dose to water measured using Aerrow was found to agree within combined uncertainties with those derived from TG-51 using calibrated reference-class ICs. Statistically significant differences on the order of (2–4)%, however, were observed when measuring absorbed dose to water using the ICs in the perpendicular orientation in the presence of the B-field. Aerrow had a peak-to-peak response of about 0.5% when rotated within the solid phantom regardless of whether the B-field was present or not. Conclusions This work describes the successful use of Aerrow as a straightforward means of measuring absolute dose to water for large high-energy photon fields in the presence of a 1.5 T B-field to a greater accuracy than currently achievable with ICs. The detector-phantom air gap does not appear to significantly influence the response of Aerrow in absolute terms, nor does it contribute to its rotational dependence.

However, the combined effect of geological and commodity price uncertainty has received relatively less attention in the technical literature. A research experiment that addresses both these sources of uncertainty is presented herein and accounts for their differences. In particular, while the current commodity price is known at the beginning of every new mining period, the geology, including the mineral grades, metal content, material types and so on, remain uncertain, even when additional information becomes available. The proposed method first uses a two-stage model to manage the geological uncertainty that leads to a scenario-independent extraction sequence. Based on different metal production targets, a pool of subsets of mining blocks is also precomputed for every period. Then, a stochastic dynamic programming algorithm is developed and employed to define the best policy in terms of metal production targets to follow, depending on the evolution of the related commodity price. This policy follows the scenario tree of the commodity price, as it is scenario-dependent (price only) with non-anticipativity constraints, which is similar to an operator that adapts to a fluctuating market. This new approach is tested through a case study that reveals the counter-intuitive combined effects of both sources of uncertainty. For instance, based on the previous evolution of the commodity price, the obtained policy suggests adaptations of the metal production target that go against common practices of mining operators.",2020-03-01,Resources Policy,https://openalex.org/V194185345,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.101570,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998695999,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.101570,journal-article,2998695999

To explore the central neural mechanisms of HFS, we conducted vertex-wise shape analyses to investigate volume and shape alterations of subcortical structures, which could help to better understand the abnormality in distinct subcortical regions and determine alternative biomarkers of HFS. Methods: Thirty patients with HFS and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls provided written informed consent. T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected from all participants. Vertex-wise shape analyses were performed to assess the volume and shape alterations of subcortical structures following HFS. Post hoc correlations with spasm severity and measures of mood dysfunction were applied to characterize subcortical brain alterations. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with HFS showed increased volume in the right caudate specifically. Furthermore, patients exhibited significant shape atrophy in the anterior medial aspect of left pallidum, together with shape expansion in the anterior ventrolateral aspect of right caudate head. In addition, shape alteration in right caudate was positively correlated with both anxiety and depression severity in patients with HFS. Conclusions: This is the first study to employ vertex-wise shape analysis to investigate subcortical brain abnormalities in patients with HFS.

Amhr2-Cre mice have been used to generate Leydig cell-specific Tspo conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Using the same Cre line, we were unable to generate Tspo cKO mice possibly because of genetic linkage between Tspo and Amhr2 and coexpression of Amhr2-Cre and Tspo in early embryonic development. We found that Amhr2-Cre is expressed during preimplantation stages, resulting in global heterozygous mice (gHE; Amhr2-Cre+/–,Tspo–/+). Two gHE mice were crossed, generating Amhr2-Cre–mediated Tspo global knockout (gKO; Tspo–/–) mice. We found that 33.3% of blastocysts at E3.5 to E4.5 showed normal morphology, whereas 66.7% showed delayed development, which correlates with the expected Mendelian proportions of Tspo+/+ (25%), Tspo–/– (25%), and Tspo+/– (50%) genotypes from crossing 2 Tspo–/+ mice. Adult Tspo gKO mice exhibited disturbances in neutral lipid homeostasis and reduced intratesticular and circulating testosterone levels, but no change in circulating basal corticosterone levels. RNA-sequencing data from mouse adrenal glands and lungs revealed transcriptome changes in response to the loss of TSPO, including changes in several cholesterol-binding and transfer proteins. This study demonstrates that Amhr2-Cre can be used to produce Tspo gKO mice instead of cKO, and can serve as a new global “Cre deleter.” Moreover, our results show that Tspo deletion causes delayed preimplantation embryonic development, alters neutral lipid storage and steroidogenesis, and leads to transcriptome changes that may reflect compensatory mechanisms in response to the loss of function of TSPO.",2020-02-01,Journal of the Endocrine Society,https://openalex.org/V2735747656,The Endocrine Society,https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvaa001,,,4,2,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999578652,https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvaa001,journal-article,2999578652

Nearly one-quarter of the world's population is estimated to have LTBI, yet few studies have been published assessing the quality of LTBI services globally. This paper reviews issues to providing patient-centered LTBI services and offers an example framework to formally assess the quality of LTBI patient care. By applying the LTBI cascade of care model, TB programmes can evaluate the gaps and barriers to high-quality care and develop locally-driven solutions to improve LTBI services. Quality care for LTBI must address some of the key challenges to services including: (1) low prioritization of LTBI; (2) gaps in healthcare provider knowledge about testing and treatment; and (3) patient concerns about side effects of preventive treatment regimens. TB programmes need to ensure that these issues are addressed in a patient-centered manner, with clear communication and ongoing evaluation of the quality of LTBI services. Quality LTBI care must be a central focus, particularly identifying and engaging more household contacts in preventive treatment, in order to halt the progression to active disease thereby stopping TB transmission globally.",2020-01-05,Journal of Clinical Tuberculosis and Other Mycobacterial Diseases,https://openalex.org/V2898488464,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jctube.2020.100142,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999691149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jctube.2020.100142,journal-article,2999691149

The composites were fabricated by melt compounding (extrusion) and compression molding, and converted into porous structures through solid-state foaming (SSF) using high-pressure gaseous carbon dioxide. The morphological and mechanical properties of neat PDLLA and composites in both nonporous and porous states were examined. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that the PGPs were well dispersed throughout the matrices. The highly porous composite systems exhibited improved compressive strength and Young’s modulus (up to &gt;2-fold) and well-interconnected macropores (up to ~78% open pores at 30 vol.% PGP) compared to those of the neat PDLLA foam. The pore size of the composite foams decreased with increasing PGPs content from an average of 92 µm for neat PDLLA foam to 19 µm for PDLLA-30PGP. Furthermore, the experimental data was in line with the Gibson and Ashby model, and effective microstructural changes were confirmed to occur upon 30 vol.% PGP incorporation. Interestingly, the SSF technique allowed for a high incorporation of bioactive particles (up to 30 vol.%—equivalent to ~46 wt.%) while maintaining the morphological and mechanical criteria required for BTE scaffolds.

This randomized trial compared single- and double-injection ultrasound-guided costoclavicular blocks. We selected onset time as the primary outcome and hypothesized that, compared with its single-injection counterpart, the double-injection technique would result in a swifter onset. Methods Ninety patients undergoing upper limb surgery (at or below the elbow joint) were randomly allocated to receive a single- (n=45) or double-injection (n=45) ultrasound-guided costoclavicular block. The local anesthetic agent (3 mL of lidocaine 1%-bupivacaine 0.25%with epinephrine  µg/mL and  mg of preservative-free dexamethasone) was identical in all subjects. In the single-injection group, the entire volume of local anesthetic was injected between the three cords of the brachial plexus. In the double-injection group, the first half of the volume was administered in this location; the second half was deposited between the medial cord and the subclavian artery. After the performance of the block, a blinded observer recorded the onset time (defined as the time required to achieve a minimal sensorimotor composite score of 1 out of 1 points), success rate (surgical anesthesia) and block-related pain scores. Performance time and the number of needle passes were also recorded during the performance of the block. The total anesthesia-related time was defined as the sum of the performance and onset times. Results Compared with its single-injection counterpart, the double-injection technique displayed shorter onset time (16.6 (6.4) vs 23.4 (6.9) min; p&lt;0.001; 95% CI for difference 3.9 to 9.7) and total anesthesia-related time (22.5 (6.7) vs 28.9 (7.6) min; p&lt;0.001). No intergroup differences were found in terms of success and technical execution (ie, performance time/procedural pain). The double-injection group required more needle passes than the single-injection group ( (1–4) vs  (1–3); p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Compared with its single-injection counterpart, double-injection costoclavicular block results in shorter onset and total anesthesia-related times. Further investigation is required to determine if a triple-injection technique (with targeted local anesthetic injection around each cord of the brachial plexus) could further decrease the onset time.

We suggest that economic activity relates to urban space by way of trajectories (punctuated by specific places) rather than by way of location. Such an approach offers a comprehensive understanding not only of the economic but also of the social realities of urban labour practices in the 21st century and the complex interplay between locations of work and leisure. As illustration, we present exploratory results that examine the work geography of some Montreal childcare workers.

Recent efforts to characterize the biophysical properties of the nucleolus have transformed our understanding of the assembly and organization of this dynamic compartment. Indeed, soluble macromolecules condense from the nucleoplasm to form nucleoli through a process called liquid–liquid phase separation. Individual nucleolar components rapidly exchange with the nucleoplasm and separate within the nucleolus itself to form distinct subcompartments. In addition to its essential role in ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus regulates many aspects of cell physiology, including genome organization, stress responses, senescence and lifespan.

The sedimentary facies comprise an iron-rich marine red bed succession and include red mudcracked dolomitic shales, tepee dolostone, crossbedded intraclastic ooid grainstone, and tepee-related sheet cavities with marine cements. These facies are interpreted to have been deposited in a Cryogenian tidal flat to subtidal setting that is laterally equivalent to the reefal and back reef environments of the Balcanoona Formation. Marine cements from this environment are characterized by well-preserved, non- and bright-cathodoluminescent zoning, and strong negative to slightly positive cerium (Ce) anomalies (Ce/Ce*). We suggest that the Angepena Formation is indicative of intermittent synsedimentary iron oxide precipitation in an oxidized peritidal environment in an otherwise strongly ferruginous and anoxic oceanic setting. Large negative Ce anomalies develop over a narrower depth range when compared to modern oxic marine settings, highlighting the importance of dissolved Mn and Fe concentrations in controlling the magnitude of the negative Ce anomalies.

Thus, there is an unmet need for new, mutation-agnostic therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors are one such class of therapeutics that have been shown to elevate intracellular cAMP levels and stimulate CFTR-dependent anion secretion in human airway epithelia; however, the number of people with CF that could be helped by PDE inhibitors remains to be determined. Here we used Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells stably transduced with rare human CFTR mutants and studied their responsiveness to the dual phosphodiesterase 3/4 inhibitor RPL554 (Verona Pharma). Through its inhibitory effect on PDE4D, we find that RPL554 can elevate intracellular cAMP leading to a potentiation of forskolin-stimulated current mediated by R334W, T338I, G551D, and S549R mutants of CFTR when used alone or in combination with CFTR modulators. We also were able to reproduce these effects of RPL554 on G551D-CFTR when it was expressed in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, indicating that RPL554 would have stimulatory effects on rare CFTR mutants in human airways and validating FRT cells as a model for PDE inhibitor studies. Furthermore, we provide biochemical evidence that VX-809 causes surprisingly robust correction of several class III and IV CFTR mutants. Together, our findings further support the therapeutic potential of RPL554 for patients with CF with class III/IV mutations and emphasize the potential of PDEs as potential drug targets that could benefit patients with CF.",2020-05-01,American Journal of Physiology-lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,https://openalex.org/V47245711,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00285.2019,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010969626,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00285.2019,journal-article,3010969626

Our balanced design systematically controlled for target word (noun vs. verb) and the context immediately preceding it. Group results from 3 native speakers of Quebec French revealed that, up to 30 ms, ERPs elicited by syntactic category violations were comparable with ERP responses to correct sentences, showing that there is no early activation reflecting syntactic category identification. Instead, in response to all anomalous conditions, we observed an N400 followed by a P600. Combined anomalies yielded additive effects of syntactic category and lexical-semantic anomalies on the N400, and a large P600 effect similar to the one observed in the pure syntactic condition. These results provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that (i) syntactic categories are processed first, and (ii) that syntactic category errors ""block"" lexical-semantic processing. Further, the N400 effect in response to pure syntactic category violations reflects a mismatch detection between a predicted word-stem and the actual target. This mechanism takes place simultaneously (and potentially in parallel) with lexical-semantic processing. In contrast, an interaction of syntax and semantics for the P600 reveals that the same neurocognitive resources are recruited for syntactic and semantic integration, both promoted by the implementation of an acceptability judgement task in our design. Additional analyses of individual data complemented these observations: during sentence processing, participants did not rely on one single cognitive mechanism reflected by either the N400 or the P600 effect but on both, suggesting that the biphasic N400-P600 ERP wave can indeed be considered to be an index of phrase-structure violations in most individuals, at least if they are realized on content words.",2020-03-13,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229169,e0229169,e0229169,15,3,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012287041,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229169,journal-article,3012287041

Mammals have occluding, diphyodont dentitions with taller teeth (hypsodonty), more complex occlusal surfaces, continuous tooth eruption, and forms of prismatic enamel that prolong the functional life of each tooth [  , 2 ]. The evolution of prismatic enamel in particular was a key innovation that made individual teeth more resilient to abrasion in early mammals [ 2 ,  ,  ]. In contrast, reptiles typically have thin, non-prismatic enamel, and shearing, polyphyodont dentitions with multi-cusped or serrated tooth crowns, multiple tooth rows, rapid tooth replacement rates, or batteries made of hundreds of teeth [  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. However, there are rare cases where reptiles have evolved alternative solutions to cope with abrasive diets. Here, we show that the combined effects of herbivory and an ancestral loss of tooth replacement in a lineage of extinct herbivorous sphenodontians, distant relatives of the modern tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) [  ], are associated with the evolution of wear-resistant and highly complex teeth. Priosphenodon avelasi, an extinct sphenodontian from the Cretaceous of Argentina, possesses a unique cone-in-cone dentition with overlapping generations of teeth forming a densely packed tooth file. Each tooth is anchored to its predecessor via a rearrangement of dental tissues that results in a novel enamel-to-bone tooth attachment. Furthermore, the compound occlusal surfaces, thickened enamel, and the first report of prismatic enamel in a sphenodontian are convergent strategies with those in some mammals, challenging the perceived simplicity of acrodont dentitions [  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] and showcasing the reptilian capacity to produce complex and unusual dentitions.",2020-05-04,Current Biology,https://openalex.org/V128425624,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.071,1755,1761.e2,30,9,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013114199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.071,journal-article,3013114199

The role of eIF4E-dependent translational control in macrophage inflammatory responses in vivo is largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the translation inhibitors eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. We show that the lack of 4E-BPs exacerbates inflammatory polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages and that 4E-BP-null adipose tissue macrophages display enhanced inflammatory gene expression following exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD). The exaggerated inflammatory response in HFD-fed 4E-BP-null mice coincides with significantly higher weight gain, higher Irf8 mRNA translation, and increased expression of IRF8 in adipose tissue compared with wild-type mice. Thus, 4E-BP-dependent translational control limits, in part, the proinflammatory response during HFD.

Due to its simplicity, versatility, and high efficiency, it has been widely used for genome editing in a variety of organisms including the protozoan parasite Leishmania, the causative agent of human leishmaniasis. Compared to the traditional homologous recombination gene targeting method, CRISPR-Cas9 has been shown to be a more efficient method to delete or disrupt Leishmania genes, generate point mutations, and add tags to endogenous genes. Notably, the stable CRISPR expression systems were shown to delete multicopy family Leishmania genes and genes present in multiploid chromosomes, identify essential Leishmania genes, and create specific chromosome translocations. In this chapter, we describe detailed procedures on using the stable CRISPR expression system for genome editing in Leishmania. These procedures include CRISPR targeting site selection, gRNA design, cloning single and double gRNA coding sequences into the Leishmania CRISPR vector pLdCN, oligonucleotide donor and drug resistance selection donor design, Leishmania cell transfection, screening, and isolation of CRISPR-edited mutants.

Rather than faithfully encoding each detail of related episodes, the brain is thought to incrementally construct probabilistic estimates of environmental statistics that are re-evaluated each time relevant events are encountered [  ]. When faced with evidence that does not adequately fit mnemonic predictions, a process called reconsolidation can alter relevant memories to better recapitulate ongoing experience [  ]. Conversely, when an ongoing event matches well-established predictions, reactivated memories tend to remain stable [  ,  ]. In part, the brain may confer selective mnemonic stability by shifting cell-intrinsic mechanisms of plasticity induction [  ], which could serve to constrain maladaptive updating of reliably predictive representations during anomalous events. Based on evidence of decreased cognitive flexibility and restricted synaptic plasticity in later life [  ], we hypothesized that some prevalent age-associated neurobiological changes might in fact contribute to mnemonic stability [  ]. Specifically, we predicted that amyloid beta (Aβ)—a peptide that often accumulates in the brains of individuals expressing senescent dementia [  ,  ,  ]—is required for memory stabilization. Indeed, we observe elevated soluble Aβx–42 concentrations in the amygdala shortly after young adult rats form reconsolidation-resistant auditory fear memories. Suppressing secretases required for A production immediately after learning prevents mnemonic stabilization, rendering these memories vulnerable to disruption by post-reactivation amnestic treatments. Thus, the seemingly pathogenic Aβ4 peptide may serve an adaptive physiological function during memory consolidation by engaging mechanisms that protect reliably predictive representations against subsequent modification.",2020-05-18,Current Biology,https://openalex.org/V128425624,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.083,1934,1940.e4,30,10,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014192555,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.083,journal-article,3014192555

Screening of these siRNAs against their corresponding mRNA targets showed that 2′-5′ linkages were well tolerated in the sense strand, but only at a few positions in the antisense strand. Extensive modification of the antisense strand minimally affected 5′-phosphorylation of the siRNA by kinases, however, it negatively affected siRNA loading into human AGO2. Modelling and molecular dynamics simulations were fully consistent with these findings. Furthermore, our studies indicated that the presence of a single 5′p-rN1-(2′-5′)-N2 unit in the antisense strand does not alter the ‘clover leaf’ bend and sugar puckers that are critical for anchoring the 5′-phosphate to Ago 2 MID domain. Importantly, 2′-5′-linkages had the added benefit of abrogating immune-stimulatory activity of siRNAs.

The research reported here presents the first deployment of a previously published proxy tool based on Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) for monitoring road salt contamination. The research was conducted at Silver Lake in Eastern Ontario, a 4-km-long lake with the heavily traveled Trans-Canada Highway (HWY 7) transiting the entire southern shore.

Since osteoclasts are responsible for bone destruction adjacent to rheumatoid synovium, profiling osteoclasts from circulating precursors in RA could help identify patients at risk for bone destruction. In this study, we sought to determine whether the functional characteristics of osteoclasts generated from their blood precursors were modified by RA activity or were intrinsic to osteoclasts and associated with the RA phenotype (erosive or not). Osteoclasts were generated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects with RA (n = 140), as well as sex- and age-matched healthy controls (n = 101).

The proportion of CD14+ PBMC was higher in RA than in control subjects, but inversely correlated with the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28). Also surprisingly, in osteoclast cultures from PBMCs, active RA was associated with lower osteoclastogenic capacity, while in vitro bone resorption per osteoclast and resistance to apoptosis were similar in both active and quiescent RA. In a small subgroup analysis, osteoclasts from subjects with recent RA that had progressed at four years to an erosive RA exhibited at baseline greater resistance to apoptosis than those from patients remaining non-erosive.

In response, the food industry has implemented Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives related to nutrition and physical activity to emphasize their concern for consumers. This study sought to describe the nature and targeted demographic of physical activity and nutrition-related CSR initiatives of large food companies in Canada and to compare companies who participate in the Canadian Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CAI), a self-regulatory initiative aimed at reducing unhealthy food advertising to children, with non-participating companies. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016. Thirty-nine large food companies, including 18 participating in the CAI, were included in the study. The webpages, Facebook pages and corporate reports of these companies were surveyed to identify CSR initiatives related to nutrition and physical activity. Initiatives were then classified by type (as either philanthropic, education-oriented, research-oriented or other) and by targeted demographic (i.e. targeted at children under 18 years or the general population). Differences between CAI and non-CAI companies were tested using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results Overall, 6 CSR initiatives were identified; 3 were nutrition-related while 2 were physical activity-related. Most (70%) initiatives were considered philanthropic activities, followed by education-oriented (20%), research-oriented (8%) and other (2%). Almost half (47%; n = 29) of initiatives targeted children. Examples of child-targeted initiatives included support of school milk programs (n = 2), the sponsorship of children’s sports programs ( n = 2) and the development of educational resources for teachers ( n = 1). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of CSR initiatives per company (CAI: Mdn = 1, IQR = 3; non-CAI: Mdn = 0, IQR = 2; p = .183) or the proportion of child-targeted initiatives (CAI: 42%; non-CAI: 54%; p = .343) between CAI and non-CAI companies.

Neural responses were recorded while male participants completed a simple monetary-reward guessing task before and after the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Results demonstrated that acute psychosocial stress significantly reduced the magnitude of neural responses to feedback in the reward-sensitive delta-frequency band but not the loss-sensitive theta-frequency band. In addition, a larger delta-frequency response to rewards at baseline predicted reduced overall cortisol response in the stress condition. These findings suggest, therefore, that neural reward circuitry may be associated with both risk for and resilience to stress-related psychopathology.",2020-07-02,Clinical psychological science,https://openalex.org/V2764897075,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/2167702620917463,872,889,8,5,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039994923,https://doi.org/10.1177/2167702620917463,journal-article,3039994923

We aimed to investigate whether sedentary behavior or sleep predicted lipid profiles in children over a 2-year period. Six hundered and thirty children from the QUALITY cohort, with at least one obese parent, were assessed prospectively at ages 8–10 and 10–12 years. Measures of sedentary behavior included self-reported TV viewing and computer/video game use. Seven-day accelerometry was used to derive sedentary behavior and sleep duration. Adiposity was assessed using DEXA scans. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls yielded estimates of carbohydrate and fat intake. Outcomes included fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol. Multivariable models were adjusted for adiposity and diet. At both Visit 1 (median age 9.6 year) and Visit  (median age 11.6 year), children were of normal weight (55%), overweight (22%), or obese (22%). Every additional hour of TV viewing at Visit 1 was associated with a 7.0% triglyceride increase (95% CI: 3.5, 10.6; P < 0.01) and 2.6% HDL decrease (95% CI: −4.2, −0.9; P < 0.01) at Visit 2; findings remained significant after adjusting for adiposity and diet. Every additional hour of sleep at Visit 1 predicted a 4.8% LDL decrease (95% CI: −9.0, −0.5; P = 0.03) at Visit 2, after adjusting for fat intake; this association became nonsignificant once controlling for adiposity.

Here, we tested if faces and facial features bias attention spontaneously when stimulus factors, task properties, response conditions, and eye movements are controlled. In three experiments, participants viewed face, house, and control scrambled face-house images in an upright and inverted orientation. The task was to discriminate a target that appeared with equal probability at the previous location of the face, house, or the control image. In all experiments, our data indicated no spontaneous biasing of attention for targets occurring at the previous location of the face.

Biomass gasification has emerged as a promising conversion technology to meet increasing global energy demands. In this study, a thermodynamic model programmed with MATLAB and CANTERA was used to study the effect of equivalence ratio on reaction temperature and producer gas during the decomposition of woody biomass in a downdraft gasifer. The composition of the producer gas was estimated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy for calculation of the equilibrium constants. A Newton–Raphson algorithm was used to find the final equilibrium state. This process began with an initial estimate for temperature of the chemical composition at equilibrium. The results of the modeling were reported based on the variation in the main indicators of the process such as cold gas efficiency and higher heating value Higher heating value. As such, variations in equivalence ratio were calculated for various moisture contents and the temperature of the reactor. Cold gas efficiency and higher heating values were maximized at optimum equivalence ratio 0.31. Gibbs free energy change through the main parts of the reactor was found to be negative and ranged from − 95 to − 280 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of oxidation was also found to be native at around − 250 kJ/mol indicating exothermic exothermic nature of the reactions in oxidation zone. However, the total enthalpy of the system increased with an increase in the temperature directing the system to be more endothermic in reduction zone (105 kJ/mol). Model predictions were satisfactorily consistent with experimental data in this study and the literature.

The onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermis has emerged as a model system for plant tissue mechanics. In this study, we performed tensile tests on strips of adaxial onion epidermis. While the tissue appeared stiffer in the direction along the major growth axis compared with the transverse direction, the tensile strength of tissue was not significantly different between the two orientations, indicating a nontrivial link between the cell wall and tissue mechanical anisotropy. Importantly, we observed the stress–strain behavior of the onion epidermis under tension to be highly nonlinear. Several hyperelastic models were fitted to the test data to evaluate their capacity to describe the nonlinear deformation of onion epidermis. The Yeoh hyperelastic model could successfully simulate the uniaxial tensile test data.

Our findings show that Aβ deposition single-handedly predicts poorer episodic memory performance and that Aβ and WMHs contribute additively to poorer performance in working memory and language while carrying synergistic associations with executive functions and attention. Through mediation modeling, we demonstrated that the influence of age over episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, and language is fully mediated by brain pathology.

Here, we simulate genetic and phenotypic data across different case/control panel sampling strategies, sequencing methods, and genetic architecture models based on evolutionary forces to determine the statistical performance of rare variant association tests (RVATs) widely in use. We find that the highest statistical power of RVATs is achieved by sampling case/control individuals from the extremes of an underlying quantitative trait distribution. We also demonstrate that the use of genotyping arrays, in conjunction with imputation from a whole-genome sequenced (WGS) reference panel, recovers the vast majority (90%) of the power that could be achieved by sequencing the case/control panel using current tools.

Infancy represents a critical developmental period when neonatal germ cells/gonocytes differentiate to spermatogonial stem cells required for spermatogenesis. Objectives (a) Determine the expression of Cox2 and associated genes in postnatal day (PND)3 rat gonocytes compared to spermatogonia. (b) Examine whether acetaminophen or ibuprofen disrupts neonatal gonocyte functions. (c) Determine whether neonatal gonocytes produce prostaglandins and whether this process is altered by acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Materials and methods The expression of Cox2 and related genes was determined by gene arrays and qPCR. Cox2 protein levels were determined by immunocyto/histochemistry and immunoblots. The effects of acetaminophen and ibuprofen on PND3 gonocyte viability, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation were examined alone and with a proliferation cocktail or differentiation factor. Prostaglandins were examined by immunocyto/histochemistry and LC-MS. Results Cox2 and related genes are highly expressed in gonocytes and spermatogonia. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen did not affect gonocyte survival or apoptosis, but they increased gonocyte proliferation. Ibuprofen significantly reduced RA-induced Stra8 expression, indicating an inhibitory effect on differentiation. Ibuprofen combined with RA decreased Cox2 mRNA and protein expression. PGE2 and PGF2α were produced by neonatal gonocytes and decreased by acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Discussion The concomitant decrease of Stra8 expression, Cox2 expression, and PGE2 and PGF2a production in gonocytes co-treated with RA suggests that Cox2 plays a role in PND3 gonocyte differentiation. The effects of acetaminophen and ibuprofen on proliferation suggest a negative relationship between Cox2 and proliferation.

Wind-driven upwelling events deliver cold nutrient-rich water to coastlines, supporting highly productive marine environments. Results from studies comparing ecological processes across upwelling regimes are mixed: some reveal weaker herbivory in upwelling regions, while others report a positive relationship between upwelling and herbivory. In this synthesis we examine the influence of upwelling on top-down control of producers across the globe. Location Global; marine ecosystems. Time period 1978–2017. Major taxa studied Marine herbivores and algae. Methods We used data from herbivory studies focusing specifically on the influence of upwelling activity (upwelling studies), and a broader collection of herbivore exclusion studies dating back four decades. For the upwelling studies we compared herbivore effects between experiments replicated across sites for which upwelling conditions were described by the authors. Meanwhile, for the broader collection of experiments we used externally sourced oceanographic data to characterize upwelling activity, and examined how herbivory changed along a gradient of upwelling activity. Results Our results consistently reveal that upwelling weakens herbivore effects on producers. Herbivory was, on average, four times weaker in upwelling sites relative to sites under weak upwelling or downwelling regimes in studies that specifically examined upwelling. The analysis of the broader herbivory literature revealed a similar weakening influence of upwelling on herbivory; however, the effect size was smaller and varied across producer functional groups. Main conclusions Nutrient subsidies from upwelling events reduce top-down control by herbivores in coastal ecosystems; however, the negative relationship between upwelling intensity and herbivory is likely the result of a combination of co-occurring processes. First, increased primary production overwhelms consumption by herbivores. Second, cold water reduces herbivore metabolism and activity. Finally, surface currents associated with upwelling activity transport herbivore larvae offshore, decoupling secondary production from herbivory.",2020-02-01,Global Ecology and Biogeography,https://openalex.org/V169694011,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13023,370,383,29,2,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985114281,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13023,journal-article,2985114281

In particular we bound the information entropy of the posterior distribution of $G\mu$ in terms of the resolution, noise level and total survey area of the CMB map. We evaluate these bounds for the ACT, SPT-3G, Simons Observatory, Cosmic Origins Explorer, and CMB-S4 experiments. These bounds cannot be saturated by any method.",2020-02-11,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3551,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987585435,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3551,journal-article,2987585435

The Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) is a PROM utilized in children with musculoskeletal disorders. We evaluated the validity and reliability of PODCI in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).Physical functioning and psychological well-being were assessed using PODCI in a large cohort of children enrolled in a multicenter study conducted by the Brittle Bone Disorders Consortium. Physical function scores were correlated with a validated, observer-rated scale, Brief Assessment of Motor Function (BAMF), and with psychological well-being scores. We calculated sample sizes required to detect clinically meaningful differences in physical function.Four hundred seventeen children with OI types I, III, and IV were enrolled. Physical function scores in OI type III were significantly lower than those in OI types I and IV. There were no significant differences in psychological well-being. PODCI physical function scores showed moderate-to-strong correlation with BAMF.

Part III: Asymmetric Response to Warming and Cooling,"Abstract Climate response is often assumed to be linear in climate sensitivity studies. However, by examining the surface temperature (TS) response to pairs of oceanic forcings of equal amplitude but opposite sign in a large set of local q -flux perturbation experiments with CAM5 coupled to a slab, we find strong asymmetry in TS responses to the heating and cooling forcings, indicating a strong nonlinearity intrinsic to the climate system examined. Regardless of where the symmetric forcing is placed, the cooling response to the negative forcing always exceeds the warming to the positive forcing, implying an intrinsic inclination toward cooling of our current climate. Thus, the ongoing global warming induced by increasing greenhouse gases may have already been alleviated by the asymmetric component of the response. The common asymmetry in TS response peaks in high latitudes, especially along sea ice edges, with notable seasonal dependence. Decomposition into different radiative feedbacks through a radiative kernel indicates that the asymmetry in the TS response is realized largely through lapse rate and albedo feedbacks. Further process interference experiments disabling the seasonal cycle and/or sea ice reveal that the asymmetry originates ultimately from the presence of the sea ice component and is further amplified by the seasonal cycle. The fact that a pair of opposite tropical q -flux forcings can excite very similar asymmetric response as a pair placed at 55°S strongly suggests the asymmetric response is a manifestation of an internal mode of the climate model system.",2020-01-15,Journal of Climate,https://openalex.org/V80591372,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-19-0131.1,1283,1297,33,4,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991357630,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-19-0131.1,journal-article,2991357630

Here, we developed design strategies to generate the first metal-DX DNA tiles (DXM ) by site-specifically functionalizing the tile crossovers with tetrahedral binding pockets that coordinate CuI . These DX junctions bind two CuI ions independently at distinct sites, display greater thermal stability than native DX tiles upon metalation, and melt in a cooperative fashion. In addition, the right-handed helical chirality of DNA is transferred to the metal centers. Our tiles display high metal ion selectivity, such that CuII is spontaneously reduced to CuI in situ.

Complications related to breast implants include early and late effusions that are often submitted for cytopathological analysis, particularly to exclude the possibility of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a rare disease that generally follows an indolent clinical course, although it is becoming clearer that a subset of patients with adverse features have a poorer prognosis. Since a late-onset breast implant-associated effusion is the most common initial presentation of BIA-ALCL, cytopathological analysis of these effusions is considered the cornerstone and gold standard for rapid, efficient, reliable diagnosis and is critical for appropriate management and treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recently published clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of BIA-ALCL and stresses the essential role of cytopathological analysis, although it remains a matter of debate if all seromas should undergo immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry, particularly for assessment of expression of CD30 irrespective of morphological appearance on cytology. Herein, we review the current knowledge on BIA-ALCL, review the key cytological findings of reactive and malignant effusions related to breast implants, and present a comprehensive cytopathological workup with the presence of atypical cells as the key and pivotal element triggering further ancillary studies.

We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population. This highlights the importance of considering potential differences between reproductive success and proxies of reproductive success, such as energetic condition or food intake, when investigating predictions of socioecological models.",2020-02-01,Hormones and Behavior,https://openalex.org/V170105747,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104632,104632,104632,118,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998377651,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104632,journal-article,2998377651

In this work, we study the effect of sclerostin deficiency on trabecular bone formation and resorption in male and female mice and whether it affects mechano-responsiveness. Male and female 10- and 26-week-old Sost knockout (KO) and littermate controls (LCs) were subjected to in vivo mechanical loading of the left tibia for 2 weeks. The right tibia served as internal control. The mice were imaged using in vivo micro-computed tomography at days 0, 5, 10, and 15 and tibiae were collected for histomorphometric analyses after euthanasia. Histomorphometry and micro-CT-based 3D time-lapse morphometry revealed an anabolic and anti-catabolic effect of Sost deficiency although increased trabecular bone resorption accompanied by diminished trabecular bone formation occurred with age. Loading led to diminished resorption in adult female but not in male mice. A net gain in bone volume could be achieved with mechanical loading in Sost KO adult female mice, which occurred through a further reduction in resorbed bone volume. Our data show that sclerostin deficiency has a particularly positive effect in adult female mice.

Retting efficiency, the resulting fibers properties and the water sorption after RF pretreatment were measured.

The results RF treated presoaked and non-presoaked flax were found to be different. The RF treatment of 3 min for the non-presoaked stems did not cause any improvement in pectin removal with a percentage decrease in pectin content of -8.41 %. The reason probably was that partial pectic substances in the non-presoaked flax phloem were dried, hardened and compacted during RF treatment.

To reap its anticipated benefits, much still remains to be understood about its implementation. In this study, we aimed to determine the nature and extent of the current evidence on DPA, in an effort to broaden our understanding of the major goals and intended outcomes of DPA as well as the lessons learned from how it has been executed in, or applied across, educational contexts. Methods We conducted a scoping study based on the methodology of Arksey and O'Malley. Our search strategy yielded 249 articles. These articles were screened for inclusion and exclusion (90% agreement), and numerical and qualitative data were extracted from 5 articles based on a pre-defined set of charting categories. The thematic analysis of the qualitative data was completed with iterative consultations and discussions until consensus was achieved for the interpretation of the results. Results Tools used to document DPA include scales, milestones and portfolios. Performances were observed in clinical or standardised contexts. We identified seven major themes in our qualitative thematic analysis: (a) underlying aims of DPA; (b) sources of information; (c) barriers; (d) contextual factors that can act as barriers or facilitators to the implementation of DPA; (e) facilitators; (f) observed outcomes, and (g) documented validity evidences. Conclusions Developmental progress assessment seems to fill a need in the training of future competent health professionals.

Most comparisons, however, focus either on output efficiency such as yields or on impacts of different nutrient management strategies on the sustainability of the agrosystems, and the impacts of each on the agricultural food webs and beneficial insects responsible for pest control – or outbreaks – has been often overlooked. While standard cropping models can explain if, why and how organic nutrient and crop management work and how they should be adapted to climate change, the lack of mechanistic models of agroecology prevents us from explaining why and how passive and active biocontrol and integrated pest management function, when they do not function, and what optimal management strategies could be employed. In this research, we show that agroecological food web models calibrated with field population dynamics data can be used to demonstrate the mechanisms behind food web dynamics that have been previously observed in the field. Results of scenario simulations show that chemical control provides immediate relief from pest pressures, but at high risk of later pest resurgence if control is not repeated; on the contrary, biological control requires more time to reduce pest populations to acceptable levels but with minimal risk of causing resurgence. In all cases, success of pest control measures is highly dependent on the date of action. In addition, the use of modelling tools to optimise biological control application dates led to much better control than either fixed date or pest population threshold-based applications. These analyses and resulting integrated pest management intervention recommendations are only possible with agroecological food web population dynamics models. We encourage future studies to examine more complex food webs from a variety of agroecosystems to test whether functional responses differ significantly, and hope that this approach will succeed in bringing agroecological food web predictive modelling to the level where it can routinely be used as a decision-making support tool, as hydrological and crop models are employed today.",2020-04-01,Ecological Modelling,https://openalex.org/V88315673,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.108961,108961,108961,421,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009008895,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.108961,journal-article,3009008895

It is challenging to control the large-amplitude vibrations of membranes due to the high flexibility, low damping, and strong geometrical nonlinearity. In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) actuators are considered to develop the active vibration control of a pre-tensioned Kapton membrane. The governing equations are established based on the geometrically nonlinear theory of plates, taking into account the modal control force induced by the actuators. To analyze the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the membrane, the theoretical and approximate solutions of nonlinear frequencies of the membrane are obtained, and the discrepancies between the two solutions under different vibration amplitudes are discussed. Control performance for both free vibration and harmonic forced vibration of the membrane is numerically studied. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the influences of different system parameters, including the pretension and the size of the membrane, and the position and number of the actuators, on the control performance. Analytical results indicate that the vibration of the membrane can be effectively suppressed with the appropriately laminated PVDF actuators. The results of this research can be extended to the active control of different gossamer space structures. • Nonlinear governing equations are established with modal control force considered. • Modal control capability of actuators on different positions is explored. • Influences of various parameters on the control effects are investigated. • The paper provides a design guideline for actuators on membrane structures.",2020-06-01,International Journal of Non-linear Mechanics,https://openalex.org/V152063775,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2020.103466,103466,103466,122,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009556168,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2020.103466,journal-article,3009556168

Nationwide compliance with these measures and its impact on overall survival (OS) are evaluated herein. Patients (n = 285,291) diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 200 to 201 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Compliance with RT administration within 365 days from diagnosis was determined for patients with stage III disease with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes post mastectomy and stage I–III disease post breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess factors associated with compliance and OS, respectively. In the mastectomy cohort, 66.9% received timely RT, showing improved OS versus no RT patients (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.67–0.73). Delayed RT patients (≥ 365 days) achieved equivalent OS to those receiving timely RT (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93–1.23) and superior OS to no RT patients (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65–0.85). In the BCS cohort, 89.4% received timely RT, showing improved OS versus no RT patients (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.45–0.49). Delayed RT was associated with improved OS versus no RT (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56–0.74) and decreased OS versus timely RT (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19–1.58). Factors associated with noncompliance included insurance type and distance to hospital. Quality measure compliance with adjuvant RT improves OS, regardless of timing after mastectomy.

It avoids economical and security problems in many industries, such as the automotive industry. Classifying a fracture into a failure mode is necessary to determine the causes that generated the fracture in the first place. Experts in fracture classification of metallic materials usually use visual evidence of textures and surface marks to determine the type of fracture. In this paper, two datasets for failure modes are employed. The first one is a real-scale fracture dataset. The second dataset consists of images obtained with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at different scales. Fracture classification performance on these datasets was evaluated using traditional convolutional neural networks for object and texture analysis. Furthermore, modifications to a deep learning architecture that extracts textural features by using the adaptive wavelet transform at its core are described.

No study (to our knowledge) has investigated this pathway considering development of preschool anxiety symptoms. Using data from the Queensland Flood study (QF2011), our objective was to determine whether toddler HPA-axis functioning mediated the association between aspects of flood-related PNMS and child anxiety symptoms at 4-years, and whether relationships were moderated by the timing of the stressor in utero or by the child’s sex. Methods Women, pregnant during the 201 Queensland floods (N = 230), were recruited soon afterwards and completed questionnaires regarding their objective hardship (e.g., loss of personal property), subjective distress (post-traumatic-like symptoms) and cognitive appraisal of the disaster. At 16 months, indexes of the child’s diurnal cortisol rhythm (awakening response, total daily output, diurnal slope [N = 80]), and stress reactivity (N = 111), were obtained. At 4-years, N = 11 mothers reported on their own mood and their children’s anxiety symptoms; of these, N = 8 also had valid child cortisol reactivity data, and N = 6 had diurnal cortisol rhythm data. Results A greater cortisol awakening response at 16 months mediated the relationship between subjective PNMS and anxiety symptoms at 4-years. Greater toddler daily cortisol secretion predicted more anxiety symptoms, independent of PNMS. The laboratory stressor did not elicit a cortisol response. PNMS effects were not dependent upon child sex nor on gestational timing of flood exposure.

EDC4 also interacts with mammalian MARF1, a recently identified endoribonuclease that promotes oogenesis and contains a number of RNA binding domains, including two RRMs and multiple LOTUS domains. How EDC4 regulates MARF1 action and the identity of MARF1 target mRNAs is not known. Our transcriptome-wide analysis identifies bona fide MARF1 target mRNAs and indicates that MARF1 predominantly binds their 3’ UTRs via its LOTUS domains to promote their decay. We also show that a MARF1 RRM plays an essential role in enhancing its endonuclease activity. Importantly, we establish that EDC4 impairs MARF1 activity by preventing its LOTUS domains from binding target mRNAs.

Autonomous motivation was examined as a mediator. Methods A multi-wave prospective longitudinal design was employed to track the progress that 935 university students made in their personal goal pursuits over an academic year. Participants set three personal goals at baseline and completed measures of personality and goal motivation. Participants' goals were coded as being either agentic or communal. Goal progress was assessed mid-year (T2) and at the end of the academic year (T3). Goal motivation was reassessed mid-year (T2). Results Conscientiousness was significantly related to making better progress on agentic, but not communal, goals. Conversely, Extraversion was related to making communal, but not agentic, goal progress. These trait-goal matching effects on progress were partially mediated by goal-specific motivation, suggesting that the selection of goals that matched one's traits resulted in higher autonomous motivation at the start of the academic year.

Current frailty risk models are limited among those undergoing thyroid or parathyroid surgery. Objective To develop and compare preoperative risk indices to determine factors associated with short-term major postoperative adverse events in patients undergoing thyroid or parathyroid surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study evaluated 154 895 patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent thyroid or parathyroid surgery from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016. Exposures Preoperative frailty-related and surgical factors from a derivation cohort were evaluated using simple and multiple logistic regression. Variables potentially associated with postoperative adverse events were subsequently combined into a personalized preoperative Cervical Endocrine Surgery Risk Index (CESRI) and compared with existing risk models using the validation cohort. Main Outcomes and Measures Composite variable of any major postoperative adverse event, including death, within 3 days of surgery. Results Of the 154 895 operations reviewed, 331 patients (2.1%; 229 women and 102 men; mean [SD] age, 56.1 [15.6] years) experienced a major postoperative adverse event, with 16 deaths (0.1%).

In a chronic stress model, a single low-dose administration of scopolamine reversed depressive-like reactivity. This antidepressant-like effect was mediated via a muscarinic M1 receptor–SKC pathway because it was mimicked by intra-medial prefrontal cortex (intra-mPFC) infusions of scopolamine, of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine or of the SKC antagonist apamin, but not by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant fluoxetine. Extracellular and whole-cell recordings revealed that scopolamine and ketamine attenuate the SKC-mediated action potential hyperpolarization current and rapidly enhance mPFC neuronal excitability within the therapeutically relevant time window. The SKC agonist 1-EBIO abrogated scopolamine-induced antidepressant activity at a dose that completely suppressed burst firing activity. Scopolamine also induced a slow-onset activation of raphe serotonergic neurons, which in turn was dependent on mPFC-induced neuroplasticity or excitatory input, since mPFC transection abolished this effect. These early behavioral and mPFC activational effects of scopolamine did not appear to depend on prefrontocortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor and serotonin-1A activity, classically linked to SSRIs, and suggest a novel mechanism associated with antidepressant response onset through SKC-mediated regulation of activity-dependent plasticity.",2020-03-14,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz187,1559,1572,30,3,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972018016,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz187,journal-article,2972018016

Hypotheses and models describe how small-scale feedbacks among vegetation, hydrology, and nutrients cause spatial differences in peat accumulation that enable microforms and surface patterns to develop over time. Empirical tests of the predictions from theoretical models of these proposed feedback mechanisms are limited, particularly in large peatland complexes such as the HBL. We investigate feedbacks controlling peatland structure and function in an ombrogenous bog and a minerogenous fen in the HBL. Our sites represent surface patterns found in many northern peatlands, specifically spatially irregular hummocks and hollows, and parallel ridges and pools that are perpendicular to slope. We found the occurrence of different spatial patterns depends on position within a peat landform, with these differences attributed to the ecohydrological setting. In turn, the ecohydrological setting, with different water table depths, nutrient availability, and species composition, influences the strength and direction of feedback mechanisms at the microform scale. Our data support the prediction of a positive feedback between plant productivity and acrotelm thickness for peat accumulation and hummock growth and that this may be enhanced by water ponding on slopes to form ridge–pool tracks. We did not find evidence to support the proposed feedback among evapotranspiration-driven transport of water and nutrients for the development of hummocks. Our results suggest a combination of mechanisms operating at various temporal and spatial scales is associated with the development of surface patterns in northern peatlands.",2020-06-01,Ecosystems,https://openalex.org/V83499872,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00436-z,741,767,23,4,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2976838605,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00436-z,journal-article,2976838605

The primary goal of this study was to assess potential for discordance between study protocols and publications reporting predictive or prognostic cancer biomarker research. Secondary objectives included comparing characteristics of publications with accessible protocols compared to those without. Methods: Publications reporting predictive or prognostic cancer biomarker research were identified from 1 major journals, 2012–2015. Protocols were sought online or through repeated queries of corresponding authors. The following four items were extracted: (1) biomarkers, (2) biospecimen/assays, (3) sample size, (4) endpoints. We defined “explicit discordance” as the presence of major inconsistencies on these items. Results: Of 14 eligible publications, we obtained 1 eligible protocols online (13%). Out of a random sample of 10 publications where protocols were not available online, 1 protocols (12%) were furnished by corresponding authors;  (8% of authors) explicitly stated the absence of a protocol. Among 2 retrospective cohort studies, no protocol could be accessed. We found explicit discordance between publications and protocols for 1 studies (58%), in particular choice of biomarkers (36%), biospecimen/assays (6%), or endpoints (29%).

However, the currently adopted methods of modification of T cells pose a risk of insertional oncogenesis because lentiviral and retroviral vectors integrate the CAR transgene in a semi-random fashion. In addition, this therapy is only available using autologous cells, which create problems in production and limit the access for patients who have their T cells depleted. One modification method that shows the ability to overcome both drawbacks is the knock-in of the CAR simultaneously knocking-out genes that prevent allogeneic therapy, such as the endogenous T cell receptor. In this mini-review, the authors present recent efforts to develop safer universal CAR-T cells.

While most of these works have focused on effects associated with atmospheric and oceanic dynamic processes caused by stratospheric ozone changes, here we show that stratospheric ozone-induced cloud radiative effects also play important roles in causing changes in Antarctic sea ice. Our simulations demonstrate that the recovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole causes decreases in clouds over Southern Hemisphere (SH) high latitudes and increases in clouds over the SH extratropics. The decrease in clouds leads to a reduction in downward infrared radiation, especially in austral autumn. This results in cooling of the Southern Ocean surface and increasing Antarctic sea ice. Surface cooling also involves ice-albedo feedback.

Experiments were controlled by a screen‐out (Plackett–Burman) statistical methodology. From the results, it could be observed that similar conditions benefited the extraction of UA and polyphenols. The highest yield of UA (6,117.2 µg/g) was obtained when ethanol (25% w/w), particle size (>250 µm), and temperature (60°C) were at their high boundaries. Phloridzin and epicatechin were identified as the most abundant polyphenols, showing concentrations of 531.4 and 288.3 µg/g, respectively. A maximum oxygen radical absorbance capacity of 113.5 µmol TE/g and total polyphenolic capacity (TPC) of 1.7 mg GAE/g were obtained. As a result, higher yields were strongly related to the effect of variables on diffusion and solubility, leading to a more efficient and sustainable process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: There is always a need to develop efficient and environmentally friendly extraction processes. It is well known that most of the conventional extraction methods are solvent intensive, time‐consuming, and require multistep. Supercritical extraction has demonstrated to be a feasible nonconventional extraction method. However, before scaling, it is essential to screen‐out critical variables among the set of variables available. The extraction of ursolic acid (UA) and polyphenol fractions from apple pomace has the potential for their application in the food and pharmaceutical industry. The current research evaluates the effect of seven variables in the extraction of UA, polyphenols, and their antioxidant capacity from apple pomace.

Here, we evaluate the completeness of intervention reporting of RCTs in OTL-HNS and evaluate whether the publication of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist has influenced intervention reporting. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective Cross-Sectional Analysis. METHODS We searched PubMed for RCTs published in top OTL-HNS journals in two cohorts, one before the release of the TIDieR and one afterward. A sample of 30 RCTs was randomly selected and screened for inclusion. Once the dataset was finalized, we extracted trial characteristics and assessed each trial's adherence to the TIDieR checklist. We then used descriptive characteristics, a generalized estimated equation, time-series analysis, and a two-sample t test to analyze our data. RESULTS After screening was completed, 17 RCTs were included in our analysis. Of these RCTs, 10 (59.5%) showed <60% adherence to the TIDieR checklist. We found a slight increase in adherence to TIDieR items after the checklist was released, although this was not statistically significant (P = .91). In addition, we found that trials with a crossover study design or multiple interventions and those that provided a Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials statement were associated with greater adherence to the TIDieR checklist. CONCLUSIONS The majority of OTL-HNS RCTs included in our analysis showed suboptimal reporting factors related to the TIDieR checklist. Requiring a TIDieR statement and automating the journal requirements process for all OTL-HNS clinical trials would be a worthwhile, efficient approach to improving research quality and ultimately patient care within OTL-HNS.

Tissue expansion was associated with an overall complication rate of 8.73% (616/7058). The most common complications were extrusion (207/7009; 3.0%) and hematoma (200/7009; 2.9%). Overall complications were highest in the scalp (65/238; 27.3%) and lowest in the mastoid (347/5688; 6.1%). Complications were more common with expansion in the non-subcutaneous plane (63/590; 10.7%). Conclusion In the absence of large clinical trials, systematic reviews such as these can help inform clinical guidelines and provide practitioners with an evidence-based reference to improve informed consent.",2020-04-01,Head & neck,https://openalex.org/V4210201749,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26017,747,762,42,4,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991367247,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26017,journal-article,2991367247

Healthy women, aged 45–69 years, were assessed for UI and sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity, menopausal status, parity, and body mass index (BMI). UI subtypes corresponding to stress (SUI) alone, urge (UUI) alone, mixed (MUI), and leakage (drops only) incontinence were classified using the Urinary Distress Inventory 6 (UDI-6). Risk factors were examined using Chi-squared tests, followed by sequential multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR and 95% confidence intervals). A total of 1,119 women (mean age 56.2 ± 5.2) completed the UDI-6. 52.3% reported any UI; MUI and SUI were the most common, each affecting 20% of women. Post-menopausal women had a lower risk (aOR 0. [0.3–0.9]) of SUI, but a higher risk (aOR 4.4 [1.0–19.9]) of UUI compared with premenopausal women. Higher education was negatively associated (aOR 0. [0.2–0.7]) with UUI, but positively associated with MUI (aOR 2. [1.3–4.0]). Parity (1–2 children) increased the risk of SUI (aOR 1. [1.0–3.1]), but reduced the risk of UUI (aOR 0. [0.2–0.9]). Obesity was associated with increased risk for MUI (aOR 2. [1.4–3.4]) and leakage (aOR 2. [1.0–4.1]). Malays and Indians had a higher risk of MUI, having (aOR 2. (1.2–3.7) and 1.

Many have found negative relationships but some have also demonstrated a positive effect for social networking on academic performance. Still others report no links between social networking and academic performance. Researchers have attempted to explain these divergences by specifying the quality and frequency of social networking habits and behaviors, distinguishing between adaptive and maladaptive traits. Yet it remains unclear how divergent use patterns are related to academic performance. To extend this literature, we examine the relationship between frequency, duration, and problematic (i.e., maladaptive) use of social networking sites on perceived performance expectancy and actual academic performance of a sample of college-level students recruited at a pre-university program in Northeastern Canada. Our findings suggest that different measures of SNS use and academic performance can yield different links between social networking and academic performance. Interestingly, we find that frequency and problematic use of SNS are related to performance expectancy though we do not find a concomitant effect for reported academic performance.

An analysis of N and P flows in Ontario’s food systems was carried out to quantify relevant flows and stocks, evaluate alternative management scenarios and identify points of loss to the environment. The results showed that mineral fertilizers accounted for 4 % of N and 90 % of P inputs to Ontario’s food systems. Of the total amount of food produced, 15 kt-N/y ± 2 % and 28 kt-P/y ± 2 % in grain and oilseed were fed to animals. About 5 % (29 kt-N/y) and  % (15 kt-P/y) of the annual supply of N and P were lost to the environment. Major nutrient losses were from the crop production system, through erosion, contributing  % (10 kt-N/y ±  %) and 90 % (14 kt-P/y ±  %) of the total N and P lost. Over half of the N and P in the waste subsystem was disposed of in landfills or incinerators, where further N losses occurred through leaching and volatilization. Ontario’s reliance on inorganic fertilizer supply could reduce by 28 kt-N/y and  kt-P/y if the current waste diversion rates were to increase by  %. No single waste management scenario could effectively circularize N and P flows in Ontario’s food system.

Focusing on a unique jurisdiction in Canada that allows for long duration CTOs with strict enforcement procedures, our objectives are to determine whether extended duration CTOs are effective and to determine whether associated hospitalization costs are reduced. Method: A mirror image, naturalistic design was employed using patients as their own controls to enhance external validity. No inclusive or exclusive criteria were employed for the 367 SPMI clinic patients who were studied over a 5-year period. Detailed documentation of the dates of all CTOs, long-acting antipsychotic injections (LAIs), emergency visits, hospitalizations, duration of hospitalizations, crimes and/or police involvement were collected. To study the relation between CTO and injection adherence, we use a mixed-effect linear regression model. To study the effect of injection adherence and hospitalization, we use survival analysis via Kaplan–Meier and Cox survival models. Results: CTO and non-CTO patients did not differ with respect to demographics, but CTO patients were significantly more severely ill. Following a CTO, adherence to LAIs increased over time ( P &lt; 0.001). The average time the patients spent in the community, that is, outside the hospital, was significantly longer under a CTO, and the duration of hospitalizations was decreased. Conclusions: LAI adherence and outpatient office visits were enhanced by extended duration CTOs, as was time out of the hospital. The shorter duration of hospital stays implies cost savings.

Each SIBLING has at least one acidic, serine- and aspartic acid-rich motif (ASARM) and multiple Ser-x-Glu/pSer sequences that when phosphorylated promote binding of the protein to hydroxyapatite for regulation of biomineralization. Mendelian disorders from loss-of-function mutation(s) of the genes that encode the SIBLINGs thus far involve DSPP causing various autosomal dominant dysplasias of dentin but without skeletal disease, and DMP1 causing autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, type  (ARHR1). No diseases have been reported from gain-of-function mutation(s) of DSPP or DMP1 or from alterations of SPP1, IBSP, or MEPE. Herein, we describe severe hypophosphatemic osteosclerosis and hyperostosis associated with skeletal deformity, short stature, enthesopathy, tooth loss, and high circulating FGF23 levels in a middle-aged man and young woman from an endogamous family living in southern India.

However, for rapid short time direct heating of food products it poses some serious difficulties because of the presence of air along the surface and internal tissues of the food products interferes with the heat transfer mechanism and slows down the effective heating of the surface. Addition of an ultrasound environment to steam can assist in removing this surface barrier and promote better heat transfer. The objective of this research was to evaluate the suitability of ultrasound—steam combination heating for (a) microbial decontamination and (b) enhancing heat transfer. It was demonstrated that short‐time (15 s) combined ultrasound—steam heating could result in more than five logarithmic cycle destruction of Escherichia coli population on carrot surfaces. Secondly, for longer time heating, the combination heat treatment was more efficient than steam alone for enhancing heat transfer rates contributing to achieve a lower heating rate index, higher temperatures and higher process lethality values. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Surface contamination of fruits, vegetables, and meats present a serious problem with respect to public health safety and their marketability. Many techniques have been employed for microbial decontamination of food contact surfaces only with limited success. New methods are always evolving to improve the process efficiency without impairing the product quality. Physical methods are gaining more popularity than chemicals due to consumer concerns for chemical additives. While steam and sound have been independently used successfully for various food processing applications, their combination has not been widely tried either to improve the efficacy of surface decontamination or improved heat transfer.

Dairy products are important sources of human dietary cholesterol intake. Therefore, monitoring bovine milk cholesterol concentration is important for human health benefit. Genetic selection for improvement of cow milk cholesterol content requires understanding of the genetics of milk cholesterol. For this purpose, we performed analyses of additive and dominance effects of 12 potentially functional SNPs within 4 candidate genes with milk cholesterol content [expressed as mg of cholesterol in 100 g of fat (CHL_fat) or in 100 mg of milk (CHL_milk)]. The additive and dominance effects of SNPs rs38064336 in AGPAT1 (P = 0.04) and rs13435724 in SOAT1 (P = 0.035) genes associated significantly with CHL_fat. Moreover, five (rs10932695 and rs523413537 in DGAT1, rs109376747 in LDLR, rs4278165 in FAM198B and rs10996777 in ACAT2) and four (rs13734738 in RBM19, rs109376747 in LDLR, rs4201694 in PPARG and rs1108621 in SCAP) SNPs were significantly associated with CHL_milk (P < 0.05) based on additive and dominance effect analyses respectively. Rs109326954 and rs523413537 in DGAT1 explained a considerable portion of the phenotypic variance of CHL_milk (7.54 and 6.84% respectively), and might be useful in selection programs for reduced milk cholesterol content. Several significantly associated SNPs were in genes (such as ACAT2 and LDLR) involved in cholesterol metabolism in the liver or cholesterol transport, suggesting multiple mechanisms regulating milk cholesterol content.

By applying machine learning techniques, we investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, found in a spiking neuronal network with inhibition-induced firing (rebounding). Our cortical sheet model produces a wide variety of network activities including synchrony, target waves, and travelling wavelets. Pattern formation is controlled by modifying a Gaussian derivative coupling kernel through varying the level of inhibition, coupling strength, and kernel geometry. We have designed a computationally efficient machine classifier, based on statistical, textural, and temporal features, to identify the parameter regimes associated with different spatiotemporal patterns. Our results reveal that switching between synchrony and travelling waves can occur transiently and spontaneously without a stimulus, in a noise-dependent fashion, or in the presence of stimulus when the coupling strength and level of inhibition are at moderate values. They also demonstrate that when a target wave is formed, its wave speed is most sensitive to perturbations in the coupling strength between model neurons.

Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between cancer antigen 12 (CA-125) levels during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and debulking success. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios and their respective 95% CI for death and recurrence. Harrell's concordance indices were calculated to evaluate which variables best predicted the chemotherapy-free interval and overall survival in our population.In all, 10 women were included. Following the first, second, and third cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CA-125 levels had a median reduction of 43.2%, 85.4%, and 92.9%, respectively, compared with CA-125 levels at diagnosis. As early as the second cycle, CA-125 was associated with overall survival (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, per 5 U/mL increment). By the third cycle, CA-125 did not only predict overall survival (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08), but it predicted overall survival better than the success of debulking surgery (Harrell's concordance index 0.646 vs 0.616).

The gold mineralization is hosted predominantly by Pontiac Group metasedimentary rocks, Piche Group metavolcanic rocks, and quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite porphyritic intrusions. The ore takes the form of a low-grade envelope of disseminated pyrite (0.35 to 1 g/t Au) grading inwards into higher grade (>1 g/t Au) stockwork and breccia zones. Hydrothermal alteration in the metasedimentary rocks is zonally distributed around the fluid pathways. Proximal alteration is characterized by a microcline±albite-quartz replacement-type assemblage, with lesser phlogopite, calcite±Fe-dolomite, pyrite and rutile. The distal alteration assemblage comprises biotite, microcline±albite, phengite, quartz, calcite, pyrite and rutile. In this study, we assess the magnitude and distribution of fluid-rock interaction in the metasedimentary rocks of the Malartic district. The metaturbidites are separated into four lithotypes based on grain-size to reduce the effects of primary depositional processes on mass change calculations. Despite the variability in protolith composition, the metasedimentary rocks define a geochemically consistent, cogenetic sequence. The results of the mass transfer calculations indicate progressive gains in CO2, S, K2O and LOI, as well as Au, Te, W, Ag, As, Be, Sb, Bi, Mo and Pb, from background, to distal and proximal alteration zones (relative to the least-altered samples). Molar element ratio analysis (alkali/aluminum) indicates an increase in alkali metasomatism (K and Na) adjacent to the main hydrothermal fluid pathways, which is manifested by the progressive stabilization of microcline and albite at the expense of oligoclase, biotite and white mica. Ore-associated pathfinder elements delineate broad enrichment patterns around the deposit, and are used to understand hydrothermal fluid circulation in the Malartic district. A statistical approach based on a comparison of the mass change results with the background composition provides robust constraints on the magnitude and extent of the lithogeochemical haloes. Generally, the alteration forms envelopes that extend along the S2 fabric, with the largest lithogeochemical anomalies (e.g., Au, W, Te and Ag) reaching up to 10 km in length, and 2 km in width.

Beyond behavioral findings, examining brain functions and structures provides a biological explanation of how language acquisition (as a natural experience) and learning (as an active skill and knowledge acquisition process) shapes the human brain. Together, combining cognitive neuroscience methods and second language acquisition and learning has offered an opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration. To facilitate cross-disciplinary understanding and potential research collaboration, this review paper aims to provide an overview of the major cognitive neuroscience methodologies adopted to study second language acquisition and learning. A selection of empirical studies covers second language acquisition in developing children, bilingualism as a naturally-occurring experience, and short-term second language learning in laboratory settings. Brain structural (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; and voxel-based morphometry, VBM) and functional (electroencephalography, EEG; and event-related potentials, EPRs) methods are briefly discussed with suggested further readings.

In addition, most studies have exclusively focused on women and the examination of pathological eating outcomes, using a dimensional symptom approach, has been somewhat limited. This study aimed to replicate and extend upon prior work. We examined the extent to which NU and/or PU are uniquely associated with dysregulated eating, using a latent factor comprised of dimensional symptoms, and directly tested whether effects differ by sex. Two independent cross-sectional samples of women and men were used (Sample 1: Midwestern university, 43 females, 34 males; Sample 2: Southwestern university, 30 females, 23 males). NU and PU were assessed with the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and dysregulated eating symptoms (i.e., binge eating, loss of control eating, eating concerns) were assessed with well-validated self-report questionnaires. Although both NU and PU showed significant positive associations with dysregulated eating, NU showed the strongest unique relationship with dysregulated eating in both samples. The relative role of PU was weakened in Sample  and completely attenuated in Sample  once its shared variance with NU was accounted for. All results were similar in men and women.

The goal of the present research was to examine whether recreational reading is beneficial for mental health during college, and to determine what motivates recreational reading.Participants were 231 university students from a large Canadian University. Methods: A longitudinal design was employed and students completed online surveys on recreational reading, motivation, psychological distress and need frustration at the beginning and end of the academic year. Results: Recreational reading was associated with reduced psychological distress over the school year. Recreational reading seemed to buffer against the frustration of one's basic psychological needs which led to improved mental health over the school year. Students who were more autonomously motivated reported reading more books recreationally. Conclusion: Recreational reading is a simple and cost-effective tool to help college students cope with mental health problems.",2020-03-09,Journal of American College Health,https://openalex.org/V70371499,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1728280,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011132923,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1728280,journal-article,3011132923

We report here novel biological properties of HspBP1 that are relevant to the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). SG assembly is a conserved reaction to environmental or pathological insults and part of the cellular stress response. Our study reveals that HspBP1 (1) is an integral SG constituent, and (2) a regulator of SG assembly. Oxidative stress relocates HspBP1 to SGs, where it co-localizes with granule marker proteins and polyA-RNA. Mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation identified novel HspBP1-binding partners that are critical for SG biology. Specifically, HspBP1 associates with the SG proteins G3BP1, HuR and TIA-1/TIAR. HspBP1 also interacts with polyA-RNA in vivo and binds directly RNA homopolymers in vitro. Multiple lines of evidence and single-granule analyses demonstrate that HspBP1 is crucial for SG biogenesis. Thus, HspBP1 knockdown interferes with stress-induced SG assembly. By contrast, HspBP1 overexpression promotes SG formation in the absence of stress. Notably, the hsp70-binding domains of HspBP1 regulate SG production in unstressed cells. Taken together, we identified novel HspBP1 activities that control SG formation. These features expand HspBP1’s role in the cellular stress response and provide new mechanistic insights into SG biogenesis.",2020-03-29,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040825,825,825,9,4,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013695492,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040825,journal-article,3013695492

Why?,"Abstract About 25 years ago, the discovery of receptive field (RF) remapping in the parietal cortex of nonhuman primates revealed that visual RFs, widely assumed to have a fixed retinotopic organization, can change position before every saccade. Measuring such changes can be deceptively difficult. As a result, studies that followed have generated a fascinating but somewhat confusing picture of the phenomenon. In this review, we describe how observations of RF remapping depend on the spatial and temporal sampling of visual RFs and saccade directions. Further, we summarize some of the theories of how remapping might occur in neural circuitry. Finally, based on neurophysiological and psychophysical observations, we discuss the ways in which remapping information might facilitate computations in downstream brain areas.",2020-04-02,Reviews in The Neurosciences,https://openalex.org/V15160710,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2019-0097,505,520,31,5,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015185646,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2019-0097,journal-article,3015185646

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Previous systematic reviews (2008; 2016) concluded similarity in outcomes between brand-name and generic drugs in cardiology, but they included ≥ 50% comparative bioavailability studies, not designed or powered to detect a difference in efficacy or safety between drug types. We aimed to summarise best-evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic versus brand-name drugs used in cardiology.For this systematic review of the literature, scientific databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from January 198 to October 2018. Original research reports comparing the clinical impact of brand-name versus generic cardiovascular drugs on humans treated in a real-life setting, were selected. Meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed. Heterogeneity (I2) and risk of bias were tested.Among the 314 screened abstracts, 7 met the inclusion criteria (n ≥ 1,000,000 patients, mean age 6 ± 1 years; 42% women). A total of 60% of studies showed no difference between drug types, while 26% concluded that the brand-name drug was more effective or safe, 13% were inconclusive and only 1% concluded that generics did better. The overall crude risk ratio of all-cause hospital visits for generic versus brand-name drug was 1.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.23; I2: 98%), while it was 1.0 (0.98-1.14; I2: 68%) for cardiovascular hospital visits. The crude risk ratio was not statistically significant for randomised controlled trials only (n = 4; 0.92 [0.63-1.34], I2: 35%).The crude risk of hospital visits was higher for patients exposed to generic compared to brand-name cardiovascular drugs.

These variants are mostly represented by small deletions/insertions, nonsense- and splice-site variants, although some larger pathogenic rearrangements occur. Currently, their contribution to familial breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OVC) in South Africa (SA) is unknown. Methods Seven hundred and forty-four patients affected with BC or OVC were screened for larger genomic rearrangements (LGRs) by means of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification or Next Generation Sequencing using the Oncomine™ BRC research assay. Results The patients represented mostly medium to high-risk families, but also included lower risk patients without a family history of the disease, diagnosed at an early age of onset (&lt; 4 years). Eight LGRs were detected (1.1%); seven in BRCA1 with a single whole gene deletion (WGD) detected for BRCA2 . These eight LGRs accounted for 8.7% of the 9 BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants identified in the 74 cases. The pathogenic LGRs ranged from WGDs to the duplication of a single exon. Conclusions Larger rearrangements in BRCA1/2 contributed to the overall mutational burden of familial BC and OVC in SA. Almost a quarter of all pathogenic variants in BRCA1 were LGRs (7/30, 23%).

New molecules are needed that can specifically bind to erythrocytes that are infected with P. falciparum for diagnostic purposes, to disrupt host-parasite interactions, or to deliver chemotherapeutics. Aptamer technology has the potential to revolutionize biological diagnostics and therapeutics; however, broad adoption is hindered by the high failure rate of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Here we performed parallel SELEX experiments to compare the impact of two different methods for single-strand recovery on the efficiency of aptamer enrichment. Our experimental results and analysis of SELEX publications spanning 13 years implicate the alkaline denaturation step as a significant cause for inefficient aptamer selection. Thus, we applied an exonuclease single-strand recovery step in our SELEX to direct aptamers to the surface of erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum . The selected aptamers bind with high affinity (low nanomolar K d values) and selectivity to exposed surface proteins of both laboratory parasite strains as well isolates from patients in Asia and Africa with clinical malaria.

Clustering of risk factors is associated with exponential increases in atherosclerotic burden from a young age. Some medical conditions and risk behaviours occurring in children can either increase the likelihood of higher levels of risk factors (such as chronic kidney disease) or the presence of risk factor clustering (such as obesity and cardiometabolic syndrome) or are associated with acquired coronary artery pathology (such as Kawasaki disease). This creates a milieu for—or increases the impact of—accelerated atherosclerosis that, in turn, increases the likelihood of premature CVD. This review highlights the importance of considering the total risk factor and risk-condition profile of pediatric patients. An algorithm is provided for stratifying patients into high-, moderate-, and at-risk categories, and practical examples are provided as to how the evaluation and management of 1 risk factor or risk condition might need to be intensified in the context of additional risk factors or risk conditions. For example, for treatment of an adolescent with familial hypercholesterolemia, the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level might be lowered by the concomitant presence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or elevated lipoprotein(a) levels. As awareness of cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis in pediatric patients increases, new at-risk conditions that warrant consideration are emerging.

We hypothesized that a significant delay from time of onset of symptoms to time of assessment by a hip arthroscopy surgeon exists. METHOD Retrospective review of prospectively collected data in an academic hospital in a single payer health care system. An electronic database analysis was conducted searching for all referrals for hip pain between February 201 and June 2017. Data were then analysed with the aim to identify the most common reason for hip referral, calculate the duration of symptoms between onset and orthopaedic assessment, and categorize previous investigations and treatments. RESULTS A total of 9 patients were included (47 male and 4 female). Main source of referrals was Family Medicine Physicians in 37% of cases and Primary Care Sports Medicine Physicians in 35%. The most common reason for referral was labral tear in 44.7% of cases followed by combined femoroacetabular impingement and labral tear in 21.8%. The duration of symptoms was longer than 2 years in 42% of cases and between  and 2 years in 40% of cases. Twenty percent of patients had previous intra-articular injection while 53% of patients had physiotherapy treatment (64% of patient underwent physiotherapy for longer than 6 months). CONCLUSION In the Canadian single payer health care system, a significant delay from the time of onset of symptoms to the time of assessment by a hip arthroscopy surgeon exists with the vast majority of patients in our cohort waiting more than 1 year.

Objectives The authors of this systematic review evaluated the potential role of corticosteroid prophylaxis for the prevention of micro-FES in gluteal augmentation procedures. Methods The authors performed a systematic search employing the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Medline, and Embase databases. Search terms were those pertaining to studies reporting the efficacy of prophylactic corticosteroid administration on micro-FES incidence in a high-risk surrogate population. Results Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for review, comprising 2 studies reporting on the efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) corticosteroid dose for the prophylaxis of micro-FES,  studies reporting on multiple prophylactic IV doses, and 2 additional studies reporting on the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in this context.

Data collection involved participant observation, interviews, and documentation review, with an interpretive framework for data analysis. We argue that the prevalent view of children shared by staff members as ""incomplete human becomings"" led to the adoption and legitimization of authoritative norms, structures and practices guided largely by a behavioral approach, which sometimes led to an increased use of control measures for reasons other than imminent harm.

The primary end point was the proportion of patients who met at least one criterion.Between January 201 and May 2017, 838 patients were entered in the database; 29 had inadequate risk data; 282 (35%) met at least one criterion for genetic testing (at-risk population). Most (83%) met just one criterion. The criterion of non-clear cell histology contributed the largest proportion of at-risk patients (59%), followed by age ≤ 4 years (28%). Sixty-one patients had documentation of genetic testing, with 5 being classified at-risk (2% of at-risk). Twenty patients (35%) of the patients at risk and tested for hereditary RCC were found to harbour a germline mutation.Application of the Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria to a large prospective database resulted in 35% of patients being identified at risk for hereditary RCC who could qualify for genetic testing. However, the true incidence of hereditary RCC in this population is unknown as most patients did not have documented genetic testing carried out and, thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria cannot be determined. The low proportion of at-risk patients who underwent genetic testing is disappointing and highlights that there may be gaps in reporting, knowledge and/or barriers in access to genetic testing.",2020-01-01,Clinical Oncology,https://openalex.org/V190064913,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2019.07.010,e10,e15,32,1,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2965555268,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2019.07.010,journal-article,2965555268

Recent evidence suggests that these cells exhibit temporal increase in excitability during whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in a phenomenon termed runup. They also exhibit a non-monotonic first-spike latency profile as a function of the holding potential in response to a fixed step-current. In this study, we use modeling approaches to unravel the dynamics of runup and categorize the firing behavior of cerebellar stellate cells as either type I or type II oscillators. We then extend this analysis to investigate how the non-monotonic latency profile manifests itself during runup. We employ a previously developed, but revised, Hodgkin–Huxley type model to show that stellate cells are indeed type I oscillators possessing a saddle node on an invariant cycle (SNIC) bifurcation. The SNIC in the model acts as a “threshold” for tonic firing and produces a slow region in the phase space called the ghost of the SNIC. The model reveals that (i) the SNIC gets left-shifted during runup with respect to I app = I test in the current-step protocol, and (ii) both the distance from the stable limit cycle along with the slow region produce the non-monotonic latency profile as a function of holding potential. Using the model, we elucidate how latency can be made arbitrarily large for a specific range of holding potentials close to the SNIC during pre-runup (post-runup). We also demonstrate that the model can produce transient single spikes in response to step-currents entirely below ISNIC, and that a pair of dynamic inhibitory and excitatory post-synaptic inputs can robustly evoke action potentials, provided that the magnitude of the inhibition is either low or high but not intermediate. Our results show that the topology of the SNIC is the key to explaining such behaviors.",2020-03-01,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,https://openalex.org/V39612629,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.105014,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2974464184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.105014,journal-article,2974464184

The current methods to assess and predict the risk associated with specific unsteady WSS consider the WSS mean values or the presence of reverse phases described by the oscillatory shear index. Recent evidence has shown that the accuracy of these methods is limited, especially with respect to the venous environment. Unsteady WSS are characterised by several features that may individually affect endothelial cells. Consequently, we assessed the effects of averaged WSS (TAWSS), temporal WSS gradient (TWSSG), maximum WSS (WSS peak) and reverse phase (OSI) by applying different WSS profiles to venous EC in-vitro, using a real-time controlled cone-and-plate cell-shearing device for 24 h. We found that TWSSG and WSS peak affect cell elongation and alignment respectively. We also found that the WSS waveforms with a peak of 1.5 Pa or higher significantly correlate with the induction of a protective phenotype. Cell phenotype induced by these high peak waveforms does not correlate to what is predicted by the hemodynamic indices currently used.

These forces can be imaged in the cultured ASM cell or assessed in the muscle strip and the tracheal/bronchial ring, but in each case, the ASM is studied in isolation from the native airway milieu. Here, we introduce a novel platform called tissue traction microscopy (TTM) to measure ASM contractile force within porcine and human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Compared with the conventional measurements of lumen area changes in PCLS, TTM measurements of ASM force changes are 1) more sensitive to bronchoconstrictor stimuli, 2) less variable across airways, and 3) provide spatial information. Notably, within every human airway, TTM measurements revealed local regions of high ASM contraction that we call “stress hotspots”. As an acute response to cyclic stretch, these hotspots promptly decreased but eventually recovered in magnitude, spatial location, and orientation, consistent with local ASM fluidization and resolidification. By enabling direct and precise measurements of ASM force, TTM should accelerate preclinical studies of airway reactivity.",2020-02-01,American Journal of Physiology-lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,https://openalex.org/V47245711,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00297.2019,L323,L330,318,2,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990893800,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00297.2019,journal-article,2990893800

Comparatively little is known about hypoxia's impacts on sensing because it is difficult to quantify sensory acquisition in vivo. Weakly electric fishes, however, rely heavily on an easily-measurable sensory modality-active electric sensing-whereby individuals emit and detect electric organ discharges (EODs). In this study, hypoxia tolerance of a mormyrid weakly electric fish, Marcusenius victoriae, was assessed by examining both its metabolic and EOD rates using a critical threshold (pcrit ) paradigm. The routine metabolic rate was 1.42 mg O2 h-1 , and the associated critical oxygen tension was 14.34 mmHg. Routine EOD rate was 5.68 Hz with an associated critical tension of 15.14 mmHg. These metabolic indicators of hypoxia tolerance measured in this study were consistent with those in previous studies on M. victoriae and other weakly electric fishes.

However, little is known about how older age and sex affect variability in the outputs of individual joints, and how these variabilities contribute to the collective gait output. Healthy adults aged 18-99 years (N = 102, 57 females) completed six trials of straight walking at self-selected speed. Stride time variability (coefficient of variation) and variabilities of lower limb tridimensional joint angles (standard deviations: SD) were calculated. Age * Sex (A * S) mixed models were conducted on all measures and year-by-year rates of change were subsequently estimated. Correlations and stepwise linear regression analyses were computed between joint angular variabilities and stride time variability. Each year of age was associated with 0.022% higher stride time variability (A: p = .002), 0.07° lower variability in peak ankle dorsiflexion (A: p = .004), 0.002-0.098° higher variability in mean ankle inversion/eversion, mean pelvic obliquity, and pelvic rotation range of motion (A: p < .05), and 0.024° higher variability in knee flexion/extension range of motion in males (A * S: p = .003). Higher variability in mean ankle and hip flexion/extension and in mean ankle inversion/eversion correlated with (ρ = 0.211-0.336; ps < 0.05) and independently predicted higher stride time variability (ps < 0.05), together explaining 21.9% of variance.

This expansion has been accompanied by claims that only No-take MPAs (NTMPAs) can effectively ensure biodiversity conservation, and the international marine conservation community has become increasingly active and influential in promoting them. However, NTMPAs clearly have consequences for resource users whose livelihoods are impacted by restricted access to natural resources. Since these consequences can trigger social conflicts that impeded progress towards conservation goals, there have been concerted efforts to find collaborative and inclusive approaches to MPA planning and management. This paper assesses stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes related to marine conservation planning and management in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, and examines how these have been influenced by shifting narratives of biodiversity conservation in the lead up to, and the execution of, the 2016 rezoning process. A dramatic shift in the rezoning process, a top-down declaration of a no-take MPA, fostered social conflicts that have delayed the full-implementation of the new zoning plan even three years after its official declaration. Through a mixed-methods approach we contrast perceptions, expectations and experiences of key actors in three stakeholder groups: the small-scale fisheries sector, the scientific research community, and the conservation management sector.

Several human genetic polymorphisms affecting GPCRs have been associated to different components of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Moreover, GPCRs have been reported to contribute to several features of alcohol-related behaviors in animal models. Besides traditional pharmacological tools, genetic-based approaches mostly aimed at deleting GPCR genes provided substantial information on how key GPCRs drive alcohol-related behaviors. In this review, we summarize the alcohol phenotypes that ensue from genetic manipulation, in particular gene deletion, of key GPCRs in rodents. We focused on GPCRs that belong to fundamental neuronal systems that have been shown as potential targets for the development of AUD treatment. Data are reviewed with particular emphasis on alcohol reward, seeking, and consumption which are behaviors that capture essential aspects of AUD. Literature survey indicates that in most cases, there is still a gap in defining the intracellular transducers and the functional crosstalk of GPCRs as well as the neuronal populations in which their signaling regulates alcohol actions. Further, the implication of only a few orphan GPCRs has been so far investigated in animal models.

Brood parasites of birds that do not reuse nest sites, however, are limited to nest-site information available to them during the current breeding season. This study explores cues used by brood parasites in a population of red-breasted mergansers nesting in upland vegetation and sandy substrate that prohibits reuse of nest sites in consecutive years. Nest-site and host traits were measured for 3 parasitized and 2 non-parasitized nests. There was no association between CBP and nest-site traits potentially providing cues about nest safety from avian predators (concealment and density of nesting larids), likely due to very low rates of egg predation. Distance to shore for parasitized nests was slightly greater than for unparasitized nests. Parasites did not select nests in relation to host age, mass, date of nest initiation, or stage of nesting (laying or incubation). Artificial nests were used to simulate natural nests without a host and to assess whether host presence serves as a cue for parasites. The proportion of natural nests receiving ≥ 1 foreign egg (60% of 1 nests) was thrice that for artificial nests (21% of 1 nests). Some aspect of host presence may therefore be an important, but not necessary, cue for brood parasites targeting nests that are heavily concealed in uplands. Whenever brood parasitism is a well-developed component of reproduction, selection is expected to favor brood parasites that make use of environmental or social information allowing them to discriminate among host nests and maximize reproductive success. We assessed cues used by brood parasites in ground-nesting red-breasted mergansers for which conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) is common, and nests are well concealed in upland vegetation. Observations at parasitized and unparasitized nests revealed that nest-site safety and visibility from habitat edges are not central to laying decisions by parasites in this population. Brood parasites, however, were considerably more likely to lay their eggs in natural nests with a host than in artificial nests without a host, suggesting that some aspect of host presence is important in the nest-site selection process for parasites. The ability of brood parasites to discriminate among nests based on host presence is expected to affect parasite success because individuals can avoid nests in which their eggs are doomed to fail (e.g., abandoned nests).",2020-02-01,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,https://openalex.org/V136529485,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-2808-3,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004288187,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-2808-3,journal-article,3004288187

Abstract Understanding how the processing of sensory information leads to behavioural responses remains a central problem in systems neuroscience. Here, we investigated how the neuromodulator serotonin affects neural and behavioural responses to second-order envelope stimuli within the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We found that serotonin application increased neuronal excitability through greater tendency for burst firing. We found that increased excitability led to overall higher neural sensitivities to higher envelope frequencies. Separating the spike train into bursts and isolated spike train components revealed that this was due to significant increases in neural sensitivity for the former but not the latter. We next investigated the consequences of such changes in sensitivity towards optimized coding of stimuli with specific statistics. Our results show that serotonin application compromised optimal coding of stimuli with statistics seen under naturalistic conditions due to changes in burst, but not isolated spike firing. Finally, we found that serotonin application increased behavioural sensitivity to envelope stimuli. Interestingly, changes in neural sensitivity due to bursts were a far better predictor of changes in behavioural sensitivity, suggesting that burst firing is decoded by downstream brain areas. Overall, our results suggest that serotonin modulates neural responses to optimize coding and perception of stimuli during behavioural contexts associated with encountering dominant conspecifics.",2020-04-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278940,1573,1589,598,8,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005021879,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278940,journal-article,3005021879

We demonstrate that such clustering leads to the conclusion that the incident bolometric radiative flux upon a random young star/disc is enhanced (relative to volume-averaged fluxes) by a factor which increases with the total stellar mass of the complex. Because the Galactic cloud mass function is top-heavy, the typical star in our Galaxy experienced a much stronger radiative environment than those forming in well-observed nearby (but relatively small) clouds, exceeding fluxes in the Orion Nebular Cluster by factors of $\gtrsim$30. Heating of the circumstellar disc around a median young star is dominated by this external radiation beyond $\sim 50\,$AU. And if discs are not well-shielded by ambient dust, external UV irradiation can dominate over the host star down to sub-AU scales. Another consequence of stellar clustering is an extremely broad Galaxy-wide distribution of incident flux (spanning $>10$ decades), with half the Galactic star formation in a substantial ""tail"" towards even more intense background radiation. We also show that the strength of external irradiation is amplified super-linearly in high-density environments such as the Galactic centre, starbursts, or high-redshift galaxies.",2020-06-11,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters,https://openalex.org/V2734515570,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl/slaa050,L86,L91,495,1,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009520161,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl/slaa050,journal-article,3009520161

From powder X–ray diffraction data an idealized structural model of K–PHI has been derived. Using atomic coordinates of this model we defined an energetically optimized K–PHI structure, in which the K ions are present in the pore and between the PHI–planes. The distance between the anion framework and K + resembles a frustrated Lewis pair-like structure, which we denote as frustrated Coulomb pair that results in an interesting adsorption environment for otherwise non-adsorbing, non-polar gas molecules. We demonstrate that even helium (He) gas molecules, which are known to have the lowest boiling point and the lowest intermolecular interactions, can be adsorbed in this polarized environment with an adsorption energy of  4.6 kJ mol − per He atom. The interaction between He atoms and K–PHI is partially originating from charge transfer, as disclosed by our energy decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals. Due to very small charge transfer interactions, He gas adsorption saturates at 8 at%, which however can be subject to further improvement by cation variation.",2020-04-02,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62638-z,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014652118,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62638-z,journal-article,3014652118

The way that speakers communicate their stance towards the listener is often vital for understanding the interpersonal relevance of speech acts, such as basic requests. To establish how interpersonal dimensions of an utterance affect neurocognitive processing, we compared event-related potentials elicited by requests that linguistically varied in how much they imposed on listeners (e.g., Lend me a nickel vs. hundred) and in the speaker's vocally-expressed stance towards the listener (polite or rude tone of voice). From utterance onset, effects of vocal stance were robustly differentiated by an early anterior positivity (P200) which increased for rude versus polite voices. At the utterance–final noun that marked the 'cost' of the request (nickel vs. hundred), there was an increased negativity between 300 and 500 ms in response to high-imposition requests accompanied by rude stance compared to the rest of the conditions. This N400 effect was followed by interactions of stance and imposition that continued to inform several effects in the late positivity time window (500–800 ms post-onset of the critical noun), some of which correlated significantly with prosody-related changes in the P200 response from utterance onset. Results point to rapid neural differentiation of voice-related information conveying stance (around 20 ms post-onset of speech) and exemplify the interplay of different sources of interpersonal meaning (stance, imposition) as listeners evaluate social implications of a request. Data show that representations of speaker meaning are actively shaped by vocal and verbal cues that encode interpersonal features of an utterance, promoting attempts to reanalyze and infer the pragmatic significance of speech acts in the 500–800 ms time window.",2020-08-01,Brain Research,https://openalex.org/V96638545,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2020.146855,146855,146855,1740,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017792975,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2020.146855,journal-article,3017792975

The yields and the structural properties of mannoproteins varied depending on the isolation methods and their sources (baker's and brewer's Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts). Noncovalently bound mannoproteins (6.5 kDa) with a mannan/protein ratio of 0.63 and 2.78 were recovered upon the heat treatment of brewer's and baker's yeasts, respectively, whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment led mainly to the release of nonglycosylated proteins. The highest yield of mannoproteins was achieved upon the enzymatic isolation with Zymolyase® from Arthrobacter luteus. The recovered covalently bound mannoproteins were characterized by a higher mannan/protein ratio (13.1 to 42.7) and a wider molecular weight distribution (5 to 10 kDa; 10 to 100 kDa; 100 to 40 kDa). Predictive models were developed to understand and modulate the effects of isolation parameters on yield, the mannoproteins content, and the mannan/protein ratio. The enzyme concentration was the most significant parameter affecting the yield, whereas the reaction time was the most significant parameter affecting mannan/protein ratio. Comparison of predicted and experimental values validated the established predicted models for the isolation of well-defined mannoproteins from yeast for targeted food applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The increasing demand for clean label health-promoting foods has fueled the development of highly functional ingredients that offer both techno-functionalities and health-promoting properties. This study reveals the efficiency of whole inactivated yeasts as sources of mannoproteins. Given the dependence of the techno-functional and health-promoting properties of mannoproteins on their molecular properties, the investigation of the effects of the yeast sources and the type of isolation methods on the structural properties of mannoproteins would allow the modulation of their properties. Furthermore, the developed predictive models for the enzymatic process are expected to enhance the isolation efficiency of mannoproteins with well-defined structures.",2020-04-27,Journal of Food Science,https://openalex.org/V23579880,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15054,1438,1449,85,5,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017935162,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15054,journal-article,3017935162

Across two experiments, we studied the role of intrinsic temperament traits, which shape stable behavioral processes, in moderating the association between mind wandering and the real-life functional outcome of academic success. In Experiment 1, participants completed the Mind Wandering Questionnaire, the Adult Temperament Questionnaire, and reported their grade for the highest degree completed or in progress. Individuals with traits of low Effortful control, high Negative affect, and low Extraversion indicated more mind wandering. Effortful control moderated the relationship between mind wandering and academic success, with higher tendency for mind wandering associated with higher academic achievement for individuals with high Effortful control, and lower academic achievement for those with low Effortful control. Experiment 2 confirmed these links using the visual metronome response task, an objective measure of mind wandering. Together, these results suggest that the intrinsic temperament trait of Effortful control represents one of the key mechanisms behind the functional influence of mind wandering on real-life outcomes.

Recent advances in the study of the human visual system suggest that ACh is a likely component underlying interocular interactions. However, our understanding of its precise role in binocular processes is currently lacking. Here we use binocular rivalry as a probe of interocular dynamics to determine ACh9s effects, via the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) donepezil, on the binocular visual system. A total of 23 subjects (1 male) completed two crossover experimental sessions where binocular rivalry measurements were obtained before and after taking either donepezil ( mg) or a placebo (lactose) pill. We report that enhanced cholinergic potentiation attenuates perceptual suppression during binocular rivalry, reducing the overall rate of interocular competition while enhancing the visibility of superimposition mixed percepts. Considering recent evidence that perceptual suppression during binocular rivalry is causally modulated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, our results suggest that cholinergic activity counteracts the effect of GABA with regards to interocular dynamics and may modulate the inhibitory drive within the visual cortex. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our research demonstrates that the cholinergic system is implicated in modulating binocular interactions in the human visual cortex.

The possibility of impact with the Earth is one of the main motivations to track and study these objects. This paper presents a tether assisted methodology to deflect a PHA by connecting a smaller asteroid, altering the center of mass of the system, and consequently, moving the PHA to a safer orbit. Some of the advantages of this method are that it does not result in fragmentation, which could lead to another problem, and also the flexibility to change the configuration of the system to optimize the deflection according to the warning time. The dynamics of the PHA-tether-asteroid system is analyzed, and the amount of orbit change is determined for several initial conditions. Only motion in the plane of the orbit of the PHA around the Sun is considered, thus the PHA chosen for the simulations has low orbit inclination.

However, there is a dearth of reference data for body composition in infancy. This study aimed to create a normative reference dataset for lean (LM) and fat (FM) mass and accretion rates in healthy infants. Methods: Healthy term-born infants (35 boys; 3 girls) were studied at ≤ 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo of age for growth and compared to World Health Organization standards.

The variability of monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation series was studied using the marginal disorder index (MDI). To investigate the intra-annual and decadal distribution of monthly and annual precipitation values, the apportionment disorder index (ADI) and decadal ADI (DADI) were applied to the time series. The continuous wavelet transform was used to decompose the ADI time series into time-frequency domains. The decomposition of the ADI series into different zones helped to identify the dominant modes of variability and the variation of those modes over time. The results revealed the high disorderliness in the amount of precipitation for different temporal scales based on disorder indices.

To date, however, there has been no attempt to generalize the scope of GSCA into the Bayesian framework. In this paper, a novel extension of GSCA, called BGSCA, is proposed that estimates parameters within the Bayesian framework. BGSCA can be more attractive than the original GSCA for various reasons. For example, it can infer the probability distributions of random parameters, account for error variances in the measurement model, provide additional fit measures for model assessment and comparison from the Bayesian perspectives, and incorporate external information on parameters, which may be obtainable from past research, expert opinions, subjective beliefs or knowledge on the parameters. We utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the Gibbs sampler, to update the posterior distributions for the parameters of BGSCA. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of BGSCA. We also apply BGSCA to real data to demonstrate its empirical usefulness.",2020-05-01,British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology,https://openalex.org/V190099528,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12166,347,373,73,2,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2942651266,https://doi.org/10.1111/bmsp.12166,journal-article,2942651266

This study uses white-gray matter contrast at the inner edge of the cortex, in addition to cortical thickness, to probe changes in microstructure and their relation with negative symptoms and possible intersections with verbal memory. Methods T 1-weighted images and clinical data were collected longitudinally for patients ( N = 88) over a two-year period. Cognitive data were also collected at baseline. Relationships between baseline VM (immediate/delayed recall) and rate of change in two negative symptom dimensions, amotivation and expressivity, were assessed at the behavioral level, as well as at the level of brain structure. Results VM, particularly immediate recall, was significantly and positively associated with a steeper rate of expressivity symptom decline ( r = 0.32, q = 0.012). Significant interaction effects between baseline delayed recall and change in expressivity were uncovered in somatomotor regions bilaterally for both white-gray matter contrast and cortical thickness. Furthermore, interaction effects between immediate recall and change in expressivity on cortical thickness rates were uncovered across higher-order regions of the language processing network. Conclusions This study shows common neural correlates of language-related brain areas underlying expressivity and VM in FEP, suggesting deficits in these domains may be more linked to speech production rather than general cognitive capacity. Together, white-gray matter contrast and cortical thickness may optimally inform clinical investigations aiming to capture peri-cortical microstructural changes.",2020-08-01,Psychological Medicine,https://openalex.org/V71144982,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291719002071,1923,1936,50,11,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970312271,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291719002071,journal-article,2970312271

Multiple imputation may help repair bias in these scenarios. However, multiple imputation has not been described for distributed data networks where data access restrictions prevent centralized analysis. Methods We conducted a simulation study and a real-world analysis using the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to evaluate multiple imputation for confounders that are systematically missing from a subset of data sites in mock distributed data networks. The simulation study addressed univariate missing data, while the real-world analysis addressed multivariate missing data. Both studies were designed as retrospective cohort studies of the effect of current statin use on the risk of myocardial infarction among patients with newly treated type 2 diabetes. Results In our simulation study, multiple imputation repaired bias from missing BMI in all scenarios, with a median bias reduction of 118% in the default scenario. In our real-world study, the multiply imputed analysis (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.08) was closer to the analysis that considered the true confounder values (HR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66-1.10) than the analysis that ignored them (HR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.20).

Although it had been assumed that the expression the α6β4 integrin (β4) is restricted to the basal lineage, we report that alveolar progenitor cells in the mouse mammary gland also express this integrin based on analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data. Subsequent experiments using a mouse mammary epithelial cell line (NMuMG) confirmed this finding and revealed that β4 is essential for maintaining progenitor function as assessed by serial passage mammosphere assays. These data were substantiated by analyzing the alveolar progenitor population isolated from nulliparous mouse mammary glands. Based on the finding that the alveolar progenitor cells express Whey Acidic Protein (WAP), WAP-Cre mice were crossed with itgβ4 flox/flox mice to generate conditional knock-out of β4 in alveolar progenitor cells. These itgβ4 flox/flox WAP-Cre + mice exhibited significant defects in alveologenesis and milk production during pregnancy compared to itgβ4 flox/flox WAP-Cre - mice, establishing a novel role for the β4 integrin in alveolar progenitor function and alveologenesis. • Alveolar progenitor cells in the mouse mammary gland express the β4 integrin. • The β4 integrin contributes to alveolar progenitor function. • Targeted deletion of β4 in nulliparous glands impedes alveologenesis and milk production.",2020-01-01,Developmental Biology,https://openalex.org/V136634221,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.10.001,13,19,457,1,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977449701,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.10.001,journal-article,2977449701

Weakly electric fishes provide an ideal model system to quantify the effects of metabolic stressors on sensory information acquisition, because they use an active-sensing strategy that permits easy measurement of the sensing effort. These fishes discharge an electric signal and sense perturbations of the resulting electric field. We used the mormyrid Petrocephalus degeni to quantify the relationship between routine metabolic rate and the rate of sensory sampling (rate of electric organ discharge, EOD) while under progressive hypoxia by quantifying the critical oxygen tension (PC-MR) and the critical electric organ discharge threshold (PC-EOD). PC-MR was significantly higher in fish acclimated to normoxia for over 40 days compared to animals tested within 1–5 days of capture from a hypoxic swamp, which suggests high costs of maintaining hypoxia tolerance; however, there was no acclimation effect on PC-EOD. All P. degeni reached their PC-EOD prior to their PC-MR. However, below the respective critical tension value, EOD rate decreased more gradually than the metabolic rate suggesting that the fish were increasing the proportion of their energy budget allocated to acquiring sensory information as dissolved-oxygen levels dropped. Trade-offs between sensory sampling and other physiological functions are also suggested by the increase in routine EOD rate with long-term normoxia acclimation, in contrast to metabolic rate, which showed no significant changes. These results highlight the relationship between sensory sampling and metabolic rate in response to progressive hypoxia and the plasticity of hypoxia tolerance.",2020-02-01,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A-molecular & Integrative Physiology,https://openalex.org/V193677276,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.110586,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981772958,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.110586,journal-article,2981772958

The estimation is based on measurements from mice skin tumors of de novo carcinogenesis. The main objective is to compare the Maximum Likelihood estimator with the best performance from our previous work with the Non–linear Least Squares estimator which is commonly used in the literature to estimate the growth parameters of the Gompertz model. Methods To describe tumor growth, we propose a stochastic model which is based on the Gompertz growth function. The principle of Maximum Likelihood is used to estimate both the growth rate and the carrying capacity of the Gompertz function, along with the characteristics of the additive Gaussian process and measurement noise. Moreover, we examine whether a Maximum A Posteriori estimator is able to utilize any available prior knowledge in order to improve the predictions. Results Experimental data from a total of 2 tumors in  mice (3 tumors each) were used to study the performance of the proposed methods with respect to prediction accuracy. Our results show that the Maximum Likelihood estimator is able to provide, in most cases, more accurate predictions. Moreover, the Maximum A Posteriori estimator has the potential to correct potentially non-realistic estimates for the carrying capacity at early growth stages. Conclusion In most cases, the Maximum Likelihood estimator is able to provide more reliable predictions for the tumor’s growth on individual test subjects.

Numerous human and animal studies have also confirmed that low-level arsenic exposure has deleterious effects on neurotransmission and brain structures which have been further linked to neurobehavioral disorders. The aim of this present work was to comparatively assess structural brain volume changes and alteration of two (2) neurotransmitters, specifically dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the brains of wild muskrats and squirrels breeding in arsenic endemic areas, near the vicinity of the abandoned Giant mine site in Yellowknife and in reference locations between 5 and 10 km from the city of Yellowknife. The levels of DA and 5-HT were measured in the brain tissues, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to attempt brain volume measurements. The results revealed that the concentrations of DA and 5-HT were slightly increased in the brains of squirrels from the arsenic endemic areas compared to the reference site. Further, DA and 5-HT were slightly reduced in the brains of muskrats from the arsenic endemic areas compared to the reference location. In general, no statistically significant neurotransmission changes and differences were observed in the brain tissues of muskrats and squirrels from both arsenic endemic areas and non-endemic sites. Although MRI results showed that the brain volumes of squirrels and muskrats were not statistically different between sites after multiple comparison correction; it was noted that core brain regions were substantially affected in muskrats, in particular the hippocampal memory circuit, striatum and thalamus. Squirrel brains showed more extensive neuroanatomical changes, likely due to their relatively smaller body mass, with extensive shrinkage of the core brain structures, and the cortex, even after accounting for differences in overall brain size.

However, motor activity can serve as a scaffold to shape the sensory flow. This tight link between motor actions and sensing is particularly evident in active sensory systems. Here, we investigate how the weakly electric mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii of undetermined sex structure their sensing and motor behavior while learning a perceptual task. We find systematic adjustments of the motor behavior that correlate with an increased performance. Using a model to compute the electrosensory input, we show that these behavioral adjustments improve the sensory input. As we find low neuronal detection thresholds at the level of medullary electrosensory neurons, it seems that the behavior-driven improvements of the sensory input are highly suitable to overcome the sensory limitations, thereby increasing the sensory range. Our results show that motor control is an active component of sensory learning, demonstrating that a detailed understanding of contribution of motor actions to sensing is needed to understand even seemingly simple behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Motor-guided sensation and perception are intertwined, with motor behavior serving as a scaffold to shape the sensory input. We characterized how the weakly electric mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii, as it learns a perceptual task, restructures its sensorimotor behavior. We find that systematic adjustments of the motor behavior correlate with increased performance and a shift of the sensory attention of the animal. Analyzing the afferent electrosensory input shows that a significant gain in information results from these sensorimotor adjustments.

There is now evidence that what is measured as gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) is not only gaseous but also consists of airborne nanoparticles with distinct physicochemical properties. Herein, we present the development of the first method for the consistent and reproducible generation of oxidized mercury nano- and sub-micron particles (~  to 40 nm). Oxidized mercury nanoparticles are generated using two methods, vapor-phase condensation and aqueous nebulization, for three proxies: mercury(II) bromide (HgBr2), mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2), and mercury(II) oxide (HgO). These aerosols are characterized using scanning mobility and optical sizing, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and nano/microparticle interface coupled to soft ionization mercury mass spectrometric techniques. Synthetic nanoparticle stability was studied in aqueous media, and using a microcosm at ambient tropospheric conditions of ~ 74 Torr pressure, room temperature, and at relative humidity of approximately 20%. Analysis of microcosm airborne nanoparticles confirmed that generated synthetic mercury nanoparticles retain their physical properties once in air. KCl-coated denuders, which are currently used globally to measure gaseous mercury compounds, were exposed to generated oxidized mercury nanoparticles. The degree of synthetic mercury nanoparticle capture by KCl-coated denuders and particulate filters was assessed. A significant portion of nanoparticulate and sub-micron particulate mercury was trapped on the KCl-coated denuder and measured as GOM. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of soft ionization mercury mass spectrometry to the measurement of mercury species present in the gaseous and solid phase.

New hydrological insights for the region Rainfall or irrigation interception by crops and residues has often been overlooked in hydrologic modelling in Iran. However, our results confirm that interception by maize canopy can significantly reduce total water input to the surface (19.9 % and 11.2 % of natural and simulated rainfalls, respectively). Although rainfall amounts and rates were similar between simulations and natural rainfall, differences in interception value may still exist between simulated and natural conditions due to the formation, size distribution, and movement of water droplets emitted from simulation systems vs. natural rainfall water droplets. Throughfall and interception significantly correlated with LAI and height of the maize canopy above thresholds of 2.5 (LAI) and 180 cm (height).

More recently, investigations have turned to examining the effects of various stimulus factors on capacity. Across two experiments, we looked at a number of factors that were expected to play a modulatory role on capacity. Experiment 1 deployed a manipulation of illusory polygons, revealing an increase in audiovisual capacity, even in an absence of visual connections. This demonstrates that exceeding the capacity of 1 does not only represent a functional increase in the binding of a singular, complex visual object, but that it can also represent binding of multiple simpler objects. Findings also support the hypothesis that capacity modulates quantitatively, but not qualitatively, with respect to speed of presentation. Experiment  examined the effects of different sound types (sine tones or white noise) and of different spatial visual field sizes on the capacity of audiovisual integration. The results indicate that capacity is maximized when stimuli are presented in a smaller circle (7.5°) if alongside a sine tone, and when presented in a larger circle (18.5°) alongside white noise. These results suggest that audiovisual integration capacity is dependent on the combination of sound type and visual spatial field size. The combination of these results reveal additional phenomenological features of the capacity of audiovisual integration, and provides impetus for further research into applications of the findings.",2020-05-01,"Attention, perception & psychophysics",https://openalex.org/V4210230012,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-019-01882-6,1971,1986,82,4,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998120724,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-019-01882-6,journal-article,2998120724

Plastic surgeons involved in teaching residents must balance a trainee’s hands-on experience while ensuring appropriate execution of difficult maneuvers. Surgical simulation, a field of growing importance with the shift towards competency-based education, may aid in trainee skill development. Through the concept of deliberate practice, the authors looked to explore the utility and economics of 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology to develop a step-specific rhinoplasty simulator. Objectives The main objective of this study was to address rhinoplasty skills previously identified as “learning areas of weakness” and develop a low-cost, step-specific simulator to help rhinoplasty teaching. Methods A patient’s facial bones, upper and lower lateral cartilages, and septum were segmented from a computed tomography scan and rendered in 3D format. This was 3D printed utilizing Ultimaker Polylactic filament with a polyvinyl acetate dissolvable support for bone, a mixture of Rigur 45 and Tango plus polyjet material for cartilage, and Smooth-On Dragon Skin for skin. Results A modular simulator was developed with  separate, interchangeable components with a perfect fit design. The simulator allowed for deliberate practice of the  rhinoplasty learning areas of weakness, with a maximal recurring cost of $75 CAD.

However, diagenesis and metamorphism can destroy primary biosignatures, making it difficult to consider biology when interpreting geochemical data. Modern analogues for ancient ecosystems can be useful tools for identifying how sediment geochemistry records an active biosphere. The Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS) in Lake Huron is an analogue for shallow Proterozoic waters due to its low oxygen water chemistry and microbial communities that exhibit diverse metabolic functions at the sediment–water interface. This study uses sediment trace metal contents and microbial abundances in MIS sediments and an oxygenated Lake Huron control site (LH) to infer mechanisms for trace metal burial. The adsorption of trace metals to Mn-oxyhydroxides is a critical burial pathway for metals in oxic LH sediments, but not for the MIS mat and sediments, consistent with conventional understanding of Mn cycling. Micronutrient trace metals (e.g., Zn) are associated with organic matter regardless of oxygen and sulfide availability. Although U and V are conventionally considered to be organically complexed in suboxic and anoxic conditions, U and organic covary in oxic LH sediments, and Mn-oxyhydroxide cycling dominates V deposition in the anoxic MIS sediments. Significant correlations between Mo and organic matter across all redox regimes have major implications for our interpretations of Mo isotope systematics in the geologic record. Finally, while microbial groups vary between the sampling locales (e.g., the cyanobacteria in the MIS microbial mat are not present in LH sediments), LH and MIS ultimately have similar relationships between microbial assemblages and metal burial, making it difficult to link trace metal burial to microbial metabolisms. Together, these results indicate that bulk sediment trace metal composition does not capture microbiological processes; more robust trace metal geochemistry such as isotopes and speciation may be critical for understanding the intersections between microbiology and sediment geochemistry.",2020-03-17,Geobiology,https://openalex.org/V41078117,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12388,462,475,18,4,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011763515,https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12388,journal-article,3011763515

Whether these second-line agents have similar effects in the general population is unknown. We aimed to compare the risk of major cardiovascular and adverse events in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist (GLP-1a), and sulfonylurea in T2DM patients not controlled on metformin therapy. Methods Retrospective cohort study using the MarketScan database (2011–2015). We selected T2DM individuals who were newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, DPP-4i, or GLP-1a, as second-line therapy, added to metformin. Cohort entry was defined by date of first prescription of the second-line agent. Time to first non-fatal cardiovascular or adverse event was compared using Cox regression models adjusted for confounders. Results Among 118,341 T2DM patients using metformin (mean age: 56), most were at low cardiovascular risk (4% with previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event). During a median follow-up of 10 months compared with sulfonylureas users, cardiovascular risk was lower in users of SGLT-2i (aHR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.97), DPP-4i (aHR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69–0.90) and GLP-1a (aHR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48–0.89). Serious adverse events were rare but compared with sulfonylurea, the risk was lower in new users of novel glucose lowering agents.

The objective of this article is to discuss the meaning of universality and related concepts before exploring the development of individual universal social programs in Canada, with a particular focus on health care and old-age pensions. More generally, the article shows how universality can exist and become resilient within a predominantly liberal welfare regime due to the complex and fragmented nature of modern social policy systems, in which policy types vary from policy area to policy area, and even from program to program within the same policy area. The broader analysis of health care and old-age pensions as policy areas illustrates this general claim. This analysis looks at the historical development and the politics of provincial universal health coverage since the late 1950s and at the evolution of the federal Old Age Security program since its creation in the early 1950s. The main argument of this article is that universality as a set of principles remains stronger in health care than in pensions yet key challenges remain in each of these policy areas. Another contention is that there are multiple and contested universalisms in social policy.&lt;/p&gt;",2020-03-18,Social Inclusion,https://openalex.org/V2764486912,Cogitatio,https://doi.org/10.17645/si.v8i1.2445,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012468719,https://doi.org/10.17645/si.v8i1.2445,journal-article,3012468719

Although the shift toward greater precision can provide health and resource benefits, it may be perceived as conflicting with both established equity-focused organ allocation norms and the legal and ethical obligations of health care providers and related institutions. With increasing evidence that various forms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch and/or prognostic biomarkers can affect outcomes, the tension between maximizing utility and ensuring equity seems likely to intensify. In Canada, health care providers are generally required by law to put the interests of their patient, such as access to an organ, above the needs of the health care system and other patients. In addition, transplantation right of access lawsuits, which have been successful in the past, could affect the implementation of precision approaches. These legal tensions could be further heightened by media representations, which have historically favored strong rights of access.

Dauer larvae can exit this stage in replete conditions with no reproductive consequence. During this diapause stage, the metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ensures that the germ line becomes quiescent to maintain germ cell integrity. Animals that lack all AMPK signalling undergo germline hyperplasia upon entering dauer, while those that recover from this stage become sterile. Neuronal AMPK expression in otherwise AMPK-deficient animals is sufficient for germline quiescence and germ cell integrity and its effects are likely mediated through an endogenous small RNA pathway. Upon impairing small RNA biosynthesis, the post-dauer fertility is restored in AMPK mutants. These data suggest that AMPK may function in neurons to relay a message through small RNAs to the germ cells to alter their quiescence in the dauer stage, thus challenging the permeability of the Weismann barrier.",2020-03-24,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,https://openalex.org/V10623703,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21062238,2238,2238,21,6,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013026315,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21062238,journal-article,3013026315

Decades of research has led to lots of knowledge of interrelationships between diffusion parameters and transition metal (TM) solutes properties in metals. But none has provided a universal relationship to elucidate the underlying physics of TM solute diffusion in metals. In this paper, we systematically study TM solutes diffusion in tungsten using the first-principles calculations coupled with harmonic transition state theory. We found the solute migration energies vary parabolically across the TM series reaching a maximum at V, Mo, and W for 3d, 4d, and 5d, respectively. The correlation factor is temperature-dependent in an Arrhenius-like way, whose fitted correlation energies and pre-factors are inversely proportional to the solute migration energies. Using the database of TM solute diffusion in tungsten developed here and other existing databases, we identify the role of the matrix metals on the law of solute diffusion. When the atomic radii of matrix metals are larger than TM solutes, the solute diffusion is dominated by metallic bonds between the solute and matrix atoms, whose solute migration energy follows a positive correlation to the melting point of the solute element. While for the reverse case, the solute diffusion is controlled by solute-induced lattice distortions and their solute migration energy shows a negative correlation with the solute radius.",2020-06-15,Computational Materials Science,https://openalex.org/V26018076,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109638,109638,109638,179,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013468706,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109638,journal-article,3013468706

Ormdl3 gene product has been shown to regulate the biosynthesis of ceramides. Allergic asthma was shown to be associated with an imbalance between very-long-chain ceramides (VLCCs) and long-chain ceramides (LCCs). We hypothesized that Fenretinide can prevent the allergic asthma-induced augmentation of Ormdl3 gene expression, normalize aberrant levels of VLCCs and LCCs, and treat allergic asthma symptoms. We induced allergic asthma by house dust mite (HDM) in A/J WT mice and Zpbp2 KO mice expressing lower levels of Ormdl3 mRNA than WT. We investigated the effect of a novel formulation of Fenretinide, LAU-7b, on the AHR, inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus production, IgE levels, and ceramide levels. Although lower Ormdl3 expression, which was observed in Zpbp2 KO mice, was associated with lower AHR, allergic Zpbp2 KO mice were not protected from inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus accumulation, or aberrant levels of VLCCs and LCCs induced by HDM. LAU-7b treatment protects both the Zpbp2 KO and WT mice. The treatment significantly lowers the gene expression of Ormdl3, normalizes the VLCCs and LCCs, and corrects all the other phenotypes associated with allergic asthma after HDM challenge, except the elevated levels of IgE. LAU-7b treatment prevents the augmentation of Ormdl3 expression and ceramide imbalance induced by HDM challenge and protects both WT and Zpbp2 KO mice against allergic asthma symptoms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Compared with A/J WT mice, KO mice with Zpbp2 gene deletion have lower AHR and lower levels of Ormdl3 expression. The novel oral clinical formulation of Fenretinide (LAU-7b) effectively lowers the AHR and protects against inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus accumulation induced by house dust mite in both Zpbp2 KO and WT A/J mice.

A high incidence of chronic opioid use (up to 58%) has been documented in these populations with significant negative individual and societal impacts. Despite the importance of this public health issue, optimal strategies to limit the chronic use of opioids after trauma and acute care surgery are not clear. We aim to identify existing strategies to prevent chronic opioid use in these populations. Methods and analysis We will perform a scoping review of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature to identify studies, reviews, recommendations and guidelines on strategies aimed at preventing chronic opioid use in patients after trauma and acute care surgery. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINHAL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ProQuest and websites of trauma and acute care surgery, pain, government and professional organisations. Databases will be searched for papers published from  January 200 to a maximum of  months before submission of the final manuscript. Two reviewers will independently evaluate studies for eligibility and extract data from included studies using a standardised data abstraction form.

We performed a multicenter feasibility study to examine our ability to identify and obtain consent from eligible APS patients and to obtain 95% adherence with daily rivaroxaban administration, in order to inform and power a larger study. Clinical outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis were also collected. Methods APS patients with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) were recruited over 2 years (Oct 2014–Sept 2016) and followed for ≥  year. Patients were assessed clinically every  months and had pill counts performed every  months. Numbers of patients fulfilling study criteria, as well as those consenting to participate, were tracked, and percentage adherence based on pill counts was recorded. These data were compared against the feasibility endpoints. Rates of thrombosis and bleeding were calculated. Criterion for feasibility was obtaining consent from 13 of 15 identified APS patients over 2 years. Results Ninety-six eligible patients were identified, and 1 declined participation. Eighty-two patients were followed for a mean of  months, representing 129.8 patient-years. Average rivaroxaban adherence was 95.0%. During follow-up, there were  thromboembolic events (2 cerebrovascular and 2 VTE). There were no episodes of major bleeding. Conclusions Adequately powered comparative trials using patient-important outcomes in APS are unlikely to be successful due to inability to recruit sufficient numbers of study subjects. This study does not reveal a higher than expected risk of recurrent thromboembolic disease compared to historical cohorts; however, this is an uncontrolled study in relatively low-risk APS patients.

This may be especially true for Inuit youth who, because they are away from their communities, cannot develop networks and relationships that would provide a secure place for their development as an adult and as a community member. The objectives of this study were to document how transition out of care is addressed in a residence specialized for Inuit youth under government care, and to explore, from the perspective of residential managers and staff, what factors facilitate or create obstacles to successful transition. Interviews were conducted to discuss the transition of 11 youth from residential placement back into communities. The criteria used by managers and staff to describe transitions mostly focused on the behaviours of the youth and the ability to create and implement a plan. Are current theme was the importance of continuity and connections with family, staff, and culture. Various measures were put into place around the current system of care in order to facilitate continuity and connections to respond to the cultural and personal needs of youth. To enhance the “cultural competence” of care, we suggest that: (i) criteria for successful and unsuccessful transitions be determined with youth, families, and communities; (ii) that Inuit representation in care be increased; and (iii) that measures be taken outside the current system of care to encourage shifts in power distribution.",2020-05-01,First Peoples Child & Family Review,https://openalex.org/V2764731138,Consortium Erudit,https://doi.org/10.7202/1068865ar,52,75,7,1,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2139989705,https://doi.org/10.7202/1068865ar,journal-article,2139989705

However, whether and to what extent post-stroke USN affects VPAs and how they contribute to mobility impairments remains unclear.To estimate the extent to which VPAs in left and right visual hemispaces are (1) affected in post-stroke USN; and (2) contribute to goal-directed locomotion.Individuals with (USN+, n = 15) and without (USN-, n = 15) post-stroke USN and healthy controls (HC, n = 15) completed (1) psychophysical evaluation of contrast sensitivity, optic flow direction and coherence, and shape discrimination; and (2) goal-directed locomotion tasks.Higher discrimination thresholds were found for all VPAs in the USN+ group compared to USN- and HC groups (p < 0.05). Psychophysical tests showed high sensitivity in detecting deficits in individuals with a history of USN or with no USN on traditional assessments, and were found to be significantly correlated with goal-directed locomotor impairments.Deficits in VPAs may account for the functional difficulties experienced by individuals with post-stroke USN.

This gap problem is the main focus of this paper. The aim here is to evaluate the extent to which cultural factors can help explain how we come to think about numbers beyond the subitizing range. To do this, I summarize Clark’s (Analysis 58:7–19, 1998) notion of a difference maker in explaining complex causation that criss-crosses between mind and world and apply it to Menary’s (In: Metzinger T, Windt JM (eds) Open MIND. MIND Group, Frankfurt, 2015a) discussion of mathematical cognition as a case of enculturation. I argue that while Menary’s views on enculturation can help explain what makes the difference between numerate and anumerate cultures, it cannot help specify what makes the difference between numerate and anumerate individuals. I argue that features of enculturation do not provide an account of innovation capable of explaining how individuals manage to improve and modify the practices of their cultural niche. This is because Menary’s construal of the role of enculturation in the development of mathematical cognition focuses mostly on the inheritance and transmission of practices,
not on their origins, which involve individual-level understanding, rather than population-level practices and pressures. The upshot is that culture provides the necessary background conditions against which individuals can innovate.

The RCFT and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) were administered to 13 participants (90 uncomplicated mTBI patients, 1 complicated mTBI patients, and 2 controls). The mTBI patients demonstrated significantly lower scores than control participants on both immediate and delayed RCFT recall conditions, with performance in the low average and borderline range.

Target words were high- and low-frequency French interlingual homophones (i.e., words that share pronunciation, but not meaning across langauges; mot means ‘word’ in French and sounds like ‘mow’ in English) and matched French control words (e.g., mois – ‘month’ in French). Readers could use the homophones’ shared phonology to activate their English meanings and, ultimately, make sense of the sentence (e.g., Tony was too lazy to mot/mois the grass on Sunday). Shorter reading times were observed on interlingual homophones than control words, suggesting that phonological representations in one language activate cross-language semantic representations.

Little is known about the benefits of immunosuppressive drugs in mild ILD. Our aim was to determine whether use of CYC or MMF was associated with an improved ILD course in patients with normal or mildly impaired lung function. Methods A retrospective cohort of SSc subjects with ILD, disease duration below seven years and no exposure to CYC or MMF prior to the baseline visit was constructed from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group registry. Subjects were categorized as having mild ILD if baseline forced vital capacity (FVC % predicted) was &amp;gt;85%. The primary exposure was any use of CYC or MMF at the baseline visit. FVC at one year was compared between exposed and unexposed subjects, using multivariate linear regression. Results Out of 29 eligible SSc-ILD subjects, 11 met criteria for mild ILD. In this subgroup, mean (s.d.) disease duration was 3.7 (2.0) years. Thirteen (11.2%) subjects were exposed to CYC or MMF at baseline. The one-year FVC was higher in exposed subjects compared with unexposed subjects, by a difference of 8.49% (95% CI: 0.01–16.98%). None of the exposed subjects experienced clinically meaningful progression over two years, whereas 24.6% of unexposed subjects did. Conclusion In this real-world setting, CYC/MMF exposure at baseline was associated with higher FVC values and a lower risk of progression among subjects with mild ILD.

Considering that palladium is rarely concentrated by hydrothermal processes, and as organic-rich black shales are the source beds for the production of hydrocarbons and bitumen commonly records the path taken by these hydrocarbons, it is reasonable to entertain the possibility that liquid hydrocarbons may act as an ore fluid for palladium. In order to test the potential of liquid hydrocarbons to act as ore fluids, Pd (0) metal wires were reacted with three crude oils, A, B and C (A being the lightest and C being the heaviest crude oil), at temperatures of 150, 200 and 250 ˚C. After reaction at 150 ˚C, the Pd concentrations in crude oils A, B and C were 6 ± 2 ppb, 1 ± 4 ppb, and 12 ± 2 ppb, respectively. The corresponding concentrations at 200 ˚C, were 1 ± 6 ppb, 1 ± 6 ppb, and  ±  ppb, respectively, and at 250 ˚C, were  ±  ppb,  ±  ppb and  ±  ppb, respectively (n = 3). The measured solubility of Pd was highest in the heaviest crude oil, C. All three oils reached their maximum Pd concentration at 150 ˚C, with Pd concentration decreasing progressively as temperature increased to 250 ˚C. To gain insights into the mechanism controlling the dissolution of Pd in crude oil, we analysed the reacted Pd wires using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectrum displays a well-defined thiol (R-SH) peak at a binding energy of 163eV, which indicates that Pd has an affinity for reduced organosulfur compounds. Moreover, Pd concentrations were observed to increase with the total thiol content of the oil, thereby corroborating the results of the XPS analyses. Our results clearly show that Pd solubility in crude oil is promoted by the presence of thiols. As thiol-rich hydrocarbons usually develop in deep, high temperature (100–140 °C) carbonate sequences containing abundant sulfate mineralization, it is thought that the thiols are the products of thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) ( Machel, 20 ). We therefore propose that liquid hydrocarbons, which have interacted with sulfate at relatively high temperature, may serve as effective ore fluids for palladium.",2020-01-05,Chemical Geology,https://openalex.org/V141585851,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.119320,119320,119320,531,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981228413,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.119320,journal-article,2981228413

Evidence from boys and girls sharing eBooks,"Purpose: Digital technologies may offer new solutions to old problems or bring additional complications. In this paper, we address a longstanding and widespread issue, specifically, slower acquisition of literacy skills by boys compared to girls. Electronic books might serve to close this gender gap because it is believed that boys are generally less motivated to read but that boys are especially engaged by technology. However, interactive features in electronic books could further challenge boys' weak self-regulation skills, thus impeding their literacy achievement. Gender differences in literacy learning and the learning environment were examined in two studies conducted in French-language kindergartens.Method: Study  involved 5 girls and 3 boys, where the relationship between oral language precursors at school entry and literacy outcomes at the end of second grade was assessed. Study  included 4 girls and 4 boys, where interactions between children and an adult during shared reading exchanges with electronic books were coded to reveal gender-related differences in the learning environment.Result: In Study 1, the oral language and emergent literacy screener in first grade significantly predicted second grade spelling, with a significant gender gap in orthographic skills favouring girls in grade two despite similar oral language skills in grade one. In Study 2, adult readers were observed to re-direct boys' attention or regulate their behaviour more often during shared reading (when compared to girls).Conclusion: These findings suggest that self-regulation may mediate early reading precursors and different literacy outcomes by gender. Strategies to alleviate stress and improve the learning environment during literacy activities are suggested. Overall, it is clear that technology is neither beneficial nor harmful by itself; rather, synchronised interactions between adult, child and technological features are crucial.

Current methods of detection, indicative of successful engraftment, occur downstream of actual islet death. Epigenetic biomarkers can be detected in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to provide an earlier indication of graft dysfunction. Aims The present study identified a biomarker of islet death using differential methylation of the insulin gene, INS, originating from β-cells in porcine islets. Materials & methods Pyrosequencing primers specific for porcine INS were designed to quantify hypomethylation along 1 cysteine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, including three sites in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element (CRE) binding protein  (CRE2) binding region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and nine sites within intron 2. Results PCR amplification of bisulfite-converted DNA combined with pyrosequencing data support the conclusion that hypomethylated porcine INS is specific to islet origin. Conclusion Moreover, the results of this study indicate a highly specific epigenetic biomarker, capable of detecting a single islet, supporting the measurement of cfDNA as a biomarker for transplanted islet death.

Besides the main decoding algorithms like successive cancellation (SC) decoding and CRC-aid SC list (CA-SCL) decoding, sphere decoder (SD) and list SD (LSD) are the alternatives for short codes with less required memory bits. Existing SD and LSD attain high calculation complexity, for SD requires a back-tracking process and LSD needs a large list size $L$ to achieve satisfying performance. To reduce complexity, an efficient software stack sphere decoder (ESSD) based on the synchronous determination is firstly proposed in this article. With the dynamic set-by-set decoding in the stack structure, it achieves the lowest complexity in SD-based decoders (SD/LSD/ESSD) while sharing the same performance on low-rate codes and high-rate codes. Compared with the CA-SCL decoder, the complexity and latency of the proposed ESSD are also competitive at high signal-to-noise-ratio on the displayed codes. Implemented on C++ , the proposed ESSD reduces $\text{44.77}\%$ latency compared with CA-SCL-32 for $\mathcal {P}(128,120)$ at the BER of $10^{-5}$ with $E_b/N_0 = \text{7}$  dB.",2020-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,https://openalex.org/V10936095,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2019.2959093,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006376412,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2019.2959093,journal-article,3006376412

Patient burden and clinical impact of such research are not well understood. Design and setting We conducted a retrospective cohort study of postapproval clinical trials launched within 5 years after the drug’s first approval, testing anticancer drugs in monotherapy in indications that were first pursued after a drug’s first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) license, for all 1 anticancer drugs approved between 2005 and 2007. FDA, Medline and Embase search date 201 February 12. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary objective was to measure burden and clinical impact for patients enrolling in these trials. Each trial was sorted into a ‘trajectory’ defined by the drug and cancer indication. The risk was operationalised by proportions of grade 3–4 severe adverse events and deaths. The clinical impact was measured by estimating the proportion of patients participating in trajectories that resulted in FDA approval, uptake into National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines or advancement to randomised controlled trials within 8 years. Results Our search captured 10 published trials exploring monotherapy, including  unique trajectories. In total, trials in our sample enrolled 46 patients. Grade 3–4 adverse events were experienced by 19.6% of patients; grade 5 events were experienced by 2.8% of patients. None of the trajectories launched after initial drug approval received FDA approval. Five trajectories were recommended by the NCCN within 8 years of the first trial within that trajectory. Eleven trajectories were advanced to randomised controlled testing. Conclusions The challenges associated with unlocking new applications for drugs that first received approval from 2005 to 20 were similar to those for developing new drugs altogether.

OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to over-stimulation of cholinergic synapses and can cause status epilepticus (SE). OPs poisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and death. Despite termination of SE, recurrent seizures and abnormal brain activity remain common sequelae often associated with long-term neural damage and cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, early treatment for prevention of seizures is of high interest. Using a rat model of paraoxon poisoning, we tested the efficacy of different neuroprotective and anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in suppressing early seizures and preventing brain damage. Electrocorticographic recordings were performed prior, during and after injection of 4.5 LD50 paraoxon, followed by injections of atropine and toxogonin (obidoxime) to prevent death. Thirty minutes later, rats were injected with midazolam alone or in combination with different AEDs (lorazepam, valproic acid, phenytoin) or neuroprotective drugs (losartan, isoflurane). Outcome measures included SE duration, early seizures frequency and epileptiform activity duration in the first 24 -hs after poisoning. To assess delayed brain damage, we performed T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging one month after poisoning. SE duration and the number of recurrent seizures were not affected by the addition of any of the drugs tested. Delayed brain injury was most prominent in the septum, striatum, amygdala and piriform network. Only isoflurane anesthesia significantly reduced brain damage. We show that acute treatment with isoflurane, but not AEDs, reduces brain damage following SE. This may offer a new therapeutic approach for exposed individuals.",2020-02-18,Neurotoxicology,https://openalex.org/V115834843,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.02.007,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008977831,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.02.007,journal-article,3008977831

Although the impact of NO on different behaviors such as movement, sleep, learning, and memory has been well documented, the identity of its molecular and cellular targets is still an area of ongoing investigation. Here, we identify a novel role for NO in strengthening inhibitory GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in molecular layer interneurons of the mouse cerebellum. NO levels are elevated by the activity of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) following Ca2+ entry through extrasynaptic NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDARs). NO activates protein kinase G with the subsequent production of cGMP, which prompts the stimulation of NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C (PKC). The activation of PKC promotes the selective strengthening of α3-containing GABAARs synapses through a GΑΒΑ receptor-associated protein-dependent mechanism. Given the widespread but cell type-specific expression of the NMDAR/nNOS complex in the mammalian brain, our data suggest that NMDARs may uniquely strengthen inhibitory GABAergic transmission in these cells through a novel NO-mediated pathway.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Long-term changes in the efficacy of GABAergic transmission is mediated by multiple presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. A prominent pathway involves crosstalk between excitatory and inhibitory synapses whereby Ca2+-entering through postsynaptic NMDARs promotes the recruitment and strengthening of GABAA receptor synapses via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Although Ca2+ transport by NMDARs is also tightly coupled to nNOS activity and NO production, it has yet to be determined whether this pathway affects inhibitory synapses. Here, we show that activation of NMDARs trigger a NO-dependent pathway that strengthens inhibitory GABAergic synapses of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons. Given the widespread expression of NMDARs and nNOS in the mammalian brain, we speculate that NO control of GABAergic synapse efficacy may be more widespread than has been appreciated.",2020-03-13,The Journal of Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V5555990,Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2211-19.2020,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011933643,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2211-19.2020,journal-article,3011933643

The addition of S-adenosine methionine (SAMe) normalized the expression of most genes in both genders, while SAMe alone induced no changes. We treated pregnant dams with a single injection of VPA on day 12.5 of gestation, or with SAMe during gestational days 12–14, or by a combination of VPA and SAMe. In the frontal half of the brain, we studied the expression of 77 genes of the pathways involved in neurophysiology and neuropathology using the NanoString nCounter method. SAMe, but not VPA, induced statistically significant changes in the expression of many genes, with differences between genders. The expression of 11 genes was changed in both sexes, and another 17 genes were changed only in females and 3 only in males. About 30% of the genes were changed by more than 50%. One of the most important pathways changed by SAMe in both sexes was the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) pathway.

Interrogation of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of neuro-cardiac diseases in animal models present challenges resulting from species differences, phenotypic variation, developmental effects and limited availability of data relevant at both the tissue and cellular level. By contrast, tissue-engineered models containing cardiomyocytes and peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons afford characterization of cellular- and tissue-level behaviours while maintaining precise control over developmental conditions, cellular genotype and phenotype. Such approaches are uniquely suited to long-term, high-throughput characterization using optical recording techniques with the potential for increased translational benefit compared to more established techniques. Furthermore, tissue-engineered constructs provide an intermediary between whole animal/tissue experiments and in silico models. This paper reviews the advantages of tissue engineering methods of multiple cell types and optical imaging techniques for the characterization of neuro-cardiac diseases.",2020-06-17,Royal Society Open Science,https://openalex.org/V2737558550,The Royal Society,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200265,200265,200265,7,6,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036433838,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200265,journal-article,3036433838

A fever surveillance study was conducted for evaluation of the clinical, epidemiological, and molecular patterns of dengue, prior to Chikungunya and Zika epidemics.In November 2011-February 2014, a passive facility-based surveillance was implemented in Santa Cruz Hospital, Medellin, and enrolled eligible febrile patients between 1 and 6 years-of-age. Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected 10-21 days apart and tested for dengue using IgM/IgG ELISA. RNA was extracted for serotyping using RT-PCR on acute samples and genotyping was performed by sequencing.Among 53 febrile patients enrolled during the study period, 29% (n = 155) were identified to be dengue-positive. Only 7% of dengue cases were hospitalized, but dengue-positive patients were 2.6 times more likely to be hospitalized, compared to non-dengue cases, based on a logistic regression. From those tested with RT-PCR (n = 173), 1 were dengue-confirmed based on PCR and/or virus isolation showing mostly DENV-3 (n = 9) and DENV-4 (n = 7) with 1 DENV-1. Genotyping results showed that: DENV- isolate belongs to the genotype V or American/African genotype; DENV-3 isolates belong to genotype III; and DENV-4 isolates belong to the II genotype and specifically to the IIb sub-genotype or linage.Our surveillance documented considerable dengue burden in Santa Cruz comuna during non-epidemic years, and genetic diversity of circulating DENV isolates, captured prior to Chikungunya epidemic in 201 and Zika epidemic in 2015. Our study findings underscore the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of dengue and other arboviruses and serve as epidemiological and molecular evidence base for future studies to assess changes in DENV transmission in Medellin, given emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases in the region.",2020-07-02,BMC Infectious Diseases,https://openalex.org/V171015910,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05172-7,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3040256307,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05172-7,journal-article,3040256307

Inference based on the Generalized Empirical Likelihood (GEL) is seen as a general solution to this problem. Kleibergen (2005) and, more generally, Guggenberger and Smith (2005) devised an elegant theory for the GEL score tests. However, strictly speaking, the GEL score tests do not nest the Newey–West score test. Our paper provides a unified framework for score tests in GMM that nests all of the above as special cases and helps us to understand the precise mechanism by which the standard first order asymptotic theory on size and power well approximates the finite sample behavior of some score tests (namely, a subset of the GEL score tests) but not others. Special attention is paid to models with weak identification. We also argue that the apparent computational burden of GEL can be overcome in practice by recognizing the fundamental common role played by the GEL implied probabilities under all special cases of our framework. In particular, we show that all the GEL implied probabilities are asymptotically equivalent at a higher order – both under the null and under appropriate sequences of alternatives – and thus are exchangeable across computationally burdensome (e.g. Empirical Likelihood) and easy (e.g. Euclidean Empirical Likelihood) GEL score tests without affecting the first order asymptotics. Extensive simulation evidence is provided to corroborate our theoretical results. The simulation results also support a simple and yet important insight on the power of the tests: the use of implied probabilities to efficiently estimate the components of the score statistic, namely, the Jacobian and the asymptotic variance of the moment vector, can significantly improve the power of the score test in finite samples.",2020-12-01,Journal of Econometrics,https://openalex.org/V127742747,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.03.004,,,,,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2939592353,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.03.004,journal-article,2939592353

In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the “positivity effect” seen in older adults’ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.",2020-03-14,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz166,1291,1306,30,3,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969318335,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz166,journal-article,2969318335

According to epidemiological studies, father's transmission of environmental effects in addition to mother's can influence offspring health. Moreover, maternal prenatal dietary folic acid (FA) may beneficially impact offspring health. The objective is to investigate whether prenatal FA supplementation can overcome the deleterious effects of prenatal exposure to POPs on lipid homeostasis and inflammation in three generations of male rat descendants through the paternal lineage. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (F0) were exposed to a POPs mixture (or corn oil) +/- FA supplementation for  weeks before and during gestation. F1 and F2 males were mated with untreated females. Plasma and hepatic lipids were measured in F1, F2, and F males after 12-h fast. Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines was determined by qPCR in epididymal adipose tissue. In F1 males, prenatal POPs exposure increased plasma lipids at 14 weeks old and hepatic lipids at 2 weeks old and prenatal FA supplementation decreased plasma total cholesterol at 14 weeks old. Prenatal POPs exposure decreased plasma triglycerides at 14 weeks old in F2 males. No change was observed in inflammatory markers. Our results show an impact of the paternal lineage on lipid homeostasis in rats up to the F2 male generation.

Caregivers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, which provides a measure of conduct problems, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems, as well as total difficulties. RESULTS Behavior problem severity differed across diagnostic groups (p < .001). Visual examination of box plots indicated substantial overlap within Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire subscales across children with autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and global developmental delay/intellectual disability. Children within each condition demonstrated matching profile topographies, such that hyperactivity-inattention difficulties were most severe. Repeated measures analysis of variances confirmed that children within each group received significantly higher ratings on the hyperactivity-inattention subscale (all p < .001). CONCLUSIONS The approach adopted to examine the data and findings have the potential to inform how we conceptualize and study behavior problems among children with neurodevelopmental conditions.

CNCs form stable liquid crystalline suspensions in water that dry to give iridescent coloured films, analogous to those found in some tropical plants. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are much longer and may have carboxyl groups on the surface. Both CNCs and CNFs are intrinsically hydrophilic and form useful aqueous gels and viscosity modifiers.

Since 5G cellular requires flexible architecture which is realized by the software defined networking paradigm, efficient polar decoder is anticipated. Though successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder achieves satisfactory performance, it requires a large amount of memory. For short control channel codes, sphere decoder (SD) is an alternative, but costs unbearable time complexity at low signal-to-noise ratio. List sphere decoder (LSD) abandons the radius and keeps a list of best paths to gain a fixed complexity. However, LSD needs a large list size L for satisfactory performance. In this paper, an efficient software LSD with path pruning and efficient sorting is proposed. We recall the radius as the bound to delete the paths out of the sphere at very early levels.

Nevertheless, the uniformity and homogeneity of the products are always challenges for the producers. Three flavor measurement methods, that is, zNose™, GC-MS, and spirit tasters, were employed and correlated for evaluation of Fenjiu flavors' difference. An automatic blending system was designed to improve the uniformity, where base liquors of Dazongjiu, Dajiu, and Daijiu, as well as pure water, were used for blending, and BPNN was employed for regression and error minimization.

We examine whether 6- to 11-year-old typically-developing children (n = 43) and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (n = 25) attend to and learn with gaze differently from another directional cue, an arrow cue. An eye-tracker recorded children’s attention to videos while they were taught novel words with a gaze cue or an arrow cue. Videos included objects when they were static or when they were manipulated to demonstrate the object’s function. Word learning was measured immediately after videos and one week later. In contrast to an arrow cue, children in both groups looked longer at a gaze cue and had more contingent looks from the gaze cue to the referent. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that across both groups, children with higher versus lower social competence skills recalled more semantic features about the referent in the gaze condition.

I present three pedagogical tools designed by developing equitable, inclusive collaboration among microbiologist outreach mentors and high school biology students. These activities aim to foster a sense of belonging in a scientific community and serve as an entry point to the practice of inclusion. Over a one-semester course at an alternative high school, ten secondary students and their scientist mentors met weekly to design and conduct microbiology experiments together. This group of students and scientists participated in structured collaborative learning activities to: i) understand each other's ideas about science; ii) collectively analyze their research findings; and iii) offer peer feedback. I modified the following three learning tools for use in my secondary science classroom from protocols of the National School Reform Faculty: 1) the Quotes Introduction Activity set the stage for equitable discourse between high school students and scientist mentors, while initiating important conversations about the process of biological research; 2) the Data Analysis Protocol allowed both students and mentors to contribute to the scientific process; and 3) the Feedback Carousel Activity engaged students and scientists alike in reviewing and refining poster presentations. This inclusive engagement in the social aspects of learning science can help students feel a sense of belonging and imagine their futures in the scientific community, key steps towards inclusion. The supportive system of structured feedback in these collaborative learning activities created a safe, inclusive space for secondary students to try on the role of microbiology expert, and for scientist volunteers to practice inclusive mentorship.

It was the culmination of an advocacy movement started in 1987 to campaign for the expansion and coordination of health research benefitting low- and middle-income countries. It was largely funded by the World Bank and embraced that institution's emphasis on cost effectiveness. But its small budget prevented it from assuming the central role in global health research that its supporters had envisaged. It took on more modest tasks, focusing on advocacy, organising an annual conference and monitoring research funding. In 2010, it was absorbed amid general indifference by another small organization, the Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED) and eventually disappeared from sight. We argue in this paper that its fate had two major causes. First, it resulted from operational and budgetary problem and its inability to attract the new money that was pouring into Global Health (GH). Second, it reflected the aggressive efforts by the WHO to reclaim leadership in this domain. Underlying this failure, however, was the inherent difficulty of coordinating the ideologically fragmented and individualistically oriented GH research domain.",2020-04-15,Global Public Health,https://openalex.org/V156279819,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1752767,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016726595,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1752767,journal-article,3016726595

This article presents findings from an analysis of ethno-racial appeals in 91 campaign documents from the 201 Toronto and 201 Chicago municipal elections. It reveals that campaigns frequently target non-White and White ethnic voters through explicit appeals. These appeals do not fit into the existing framework of racial priming theory. Drawing instead on Bourdieu’s theory of capital, the article conceptualizes ethno-racial appeals as attempts to produce or destroy a candidate’s political capital among specific groups. Campaigns do this directly by making claims about the group’s purported interests or indirectly by invoking candidates’ relevant cultural or social capital.

The growth cone, a highly motile structure at the tip of the axon, is capable of recognizing extracellular guidance cues and translating them into directed axon outgrowth through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Netrin-1 mediates its attractive function through the receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) to promote axon outgrowth and guidance. The calcium-activated protease calpain is involved in the cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins, which plays an important role during adhesion turnover and cell migration. However, its function during neuronal development is less understood. Here we demonstrate that netrin-1 activated calpain in embryonic rat cortical neurons in an extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent manner. In addition, we found that netrin-1 stimulation led to an increase in calpain-1 localization in the axon, whereas its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin was decreased in the growth cones of cortical neurons by indirect immunofluorescence. Interestingly, calpain-1 was able to cleave DCC in vitro. Furthermore, netrin-1 induced the cleavage of the cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and focal adhesion kinase concomitantly with the intracellular domain of DCC in a calpain-dependent manner in embryonic rat cortical neurons. Cortical neurons over-expressing calpastatin or calpain-depleted neurons displayed increased basal axon length and were unresponsive to netrin-1 stimulation. Altogether, we propose a novel model whereby netrin-1/DCC-mediated axon outgrowth is modulated by calpain-mediated proteolysis of DCC and cytoskeletal targets in embryonic cortical neurons.

Both are tremendous burdens to health-care systems. Among patients with established HF, diabetes mellitus is one of the most common comorbidities, present in up to 45% of all patients. Although atherosclerotic CV disease outcomes are thought to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes, HF death and hospitalization has been recognized as being just as common. However, despite this evidence, HF as an outcome among trials of glucose-lowering therapies has been largely ignored. Now, there are  noninferiority CV outcome trials that have demonstrated the efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors to reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations in patients with type 2 diabetes with CV risk factors and/or established atherosclerotic CV disease. The demonstration of a reduction in HF outcomes seen in these CV outcome trials represents a paradigm shift in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic CV disease or CV risk factors. Whether SGLT-2 inhibitors represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of CV events among patients with established HF remains to be explored. Furthermore, the benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors in a population of patients with HF yet without diabetes remains to be demonstrated across multiple trials.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how three different types of journals, namely open access (OA) journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals, responded to receiving a previously published manuscript for review. Methods We performed a quasi-experimental study in which we submitted a previously published article to a random sample of 60 biomedical journals, roughly 20 journals from each journal type sampled: OA journals, subscription-based journals, and presumed predatory journals. Three hundred and three journals received a Word version in manuscript format, while 29 journals received the formatted publisher’s PDF version of the published article. We then recorded responses to the submission received after approximately 1 month. Responses were reviewed, extracted, and coded in duplicate. Our primary outcome was the rate of rejection of the two types of submitted articles (PDF vs Word) within our three journal types. Results We received correspondence back from 30 (51.1%) journals within our study timeline (3 days); ( N = 4 predatory journals, N = 12 OA journals, N = 13 subscription-based journals). Of the journals that responded, 1 received the Word version of the paper, while 1 received the PDF version. Four journals (1.3%) accepted our paper, 2 (94.5%) journals rejected the paper, and  (4.2%) requested a revision.

Yet little is known about the SNORC protein biochemical properties, and mechanistically how the gene is regulated transcriptionally in a tissue-specific manner. The goals of the present study were to shed light on those important aspects. The chondrocyte nature of Snorc expression was confirmed in mouse and rat tissues, in differentiated (day 7) ATDC5, and in RCS cells where it was constitutive. Topological mapping and biochemical analysis brought experimental evidences that SNORC is a type I protein carrying a chondroitin sulfate (CS) attached to serine 44. The anomalous migration of SNORC on SDS-PAGE was due to its primary polypeptide features, suggesting no additional post-translational modifications apart from the CS glycosaminoglycan. A highly conserved SOX9-binding enhancer located in intron 1 was necessary to drive transcription of Snorc in the mouse, rat, and human. The enhancer was active independently of orientation and whether located in a heterologous promoter or intron. Crispr-mediated inactivation of the enhancer in RCS cells caused reduction of Snorc . Transgenic mice carrying the intronic multimerized enhancer drove high expression of a βGeo reporter in chondrocytes, but not in the hypertrophic zone.

However, it is known that RAT fails to fully account for tissue heterogeneity and is therefore inaccurate in the lung. The aim of this study is to make a dosimetric assessment of 21 non-small cell lung cancer CyberKnife plans by recalculating their dose distributions using an independent Monte Carlo (MC) method. For plans initially calculated by RAT without heterogeneity corrections, target coverage was found to be significantly compromised when considering MC doses. Only 35.4% of plans were found to comply to their prescription doses. If the normal tissue dose limits were respected in the treatment planning dose, the MC recalculated dose did not exceed these limits in over 97% of the plans. Comparison of RAT and recalculated-MC doses confirmed the overestimation of RAT doses observed in previous studies. An inverse correlation between the RAT/MC dose ratio and the target size was also found to be statistically significant ( p 1 -  ), consistent with other studies. In addition, the inaccuracy and variability in target coverage incurred from dose calculations using RAT without heterogeneity corrections was demonstrated. On average, no clinically relevant differences were observed between MC-calculated dose-to-water and dose-to-medium for all tissues investigated ( ⩽ 1%). Patients receiving a dose D 9 % larger than 119 Gy in EQD210 (or ≈ 52 Gy in  fractions) as recalculated by MC were observed to have significantly superior loco-regional progression-free survival rates ( p = 0.02 ) with a hazard ratio of 3.45 (95%CI: 1.14–10.5).",2020-08-01,Physica Medica,https://openalex.org/V138998826,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.06.006,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036080924,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.06.006,journal-article,3036080924
