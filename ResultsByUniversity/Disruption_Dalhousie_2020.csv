Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers are abruptly changing their care delivery to protect patients and staff from infection and to reallocate resource towards the greatest acute needs. Elective, routine, and nonemergency casework has stopped in secondary and tertiary centres, while in primary care, patients are requested to stay away or “socially distance,” and in residential care facilities and hospices, strict isolation and separation protocols have been introduced.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine and eHealth approaches were being developed and tested in a gradual fashion with many studies focusing on lessons learned and barriers to using digital solutions.3,37,39,51 Overnight, however, treating or supporting people with non-urgent and long-term conditions at a distance from healthcare providers has become imperative. These immediate changes are happening across healthcare systems. Telemedicine is being used to demand-manage the flow of patients with respiratory distress accessing emergency departments25; video consultation is being introduced in multiple settings23; and using social media is being discussed positively for its potential to direct people to trusted resources, to counteract misinformation, and to provide psychological first aid.36

As of 2 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 10 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare.

Caspase- activation is hierarchically controlled by GBPs; GBP initiates platform assembly, GBP and GBP control caspase-4 recruitment, and GBP governs caspase-4 activation. In response to cytosol-invading bacteria, activation of caspase-4 through the GB platform is essential to induce gasdermin-D-dependent pyroptosis and processing of interleukin-18, thereby destroying the replicative niche for intracellular bacteria and alerting neighboring cells, respectively.

The DoS attacks are based on the time-sequence fashion and occur aperiodically in an unknown attack strategy, which can usually damage the control channels executed by an intelligent adversary. A novel event-triggered control scheme on the basis of the relative interagent state is developed under the DoS attacks, by designing a link-based estimator to estimate the relative interagent state between intermitted communication instead of the absolute state. Compared with most of the existing work on the design of the triggering condition related to the state measurement error, the proposed triggering condition is designed based on the control input signal from the view of privacy protection, which can avoid continuous sampling for every agent. Besides, the attack frequency and attack duration of DoS attacks are analyzed and the secure consensus is reachable provided that the attack frequency and attack duration satisfy some certain conditions under the proposed control algorithm. “Zeno phenomenon” does not exhibit by proving that there exist different positive lower bounds corresponding to different link-based triggering conditions.

It is becoming increasingly evident that small changes in the efficiency of the BCP can significantly alter ocean carbon sequestration and, thus, atmospheric CO 2 and climate, as well as the functioning of midwater ecosystems. Earth system models, including those used by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most often assess POC (particulate organic carbon) flux into the ocean interior at a fixed reference depth. The extrapolation of these fluxes to other depths, which defines the BCP efficiencies, is often executed using an idealized and empirically based flux-vs.-depth relationship, often referred to as the “Martin curve.” We use a new compilation of POC fluxes in the upper ocean to reveal very different patterns in BCP efficiencies depending upon whether the fluxes are assessed at a fixed reference depth or relative to the depth of the sunlit euphotic zone (Ez). We find that the fixed-depth approach underestimates BCP efficiencies when the Ez is shallow, and vice versa. This adjustment alters regional assessments of BCP efficiencies as well as global carbon budgets and the interpretation of prior BCP studies. With several international studies recently underway to study the ocean BCP, there are new and unique opportunities to improve our understanding of the mechanistic controls on BCP efficiencies.

Further, dysregulation of the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators contributes to a decline in the generation of an effective CD8 T cell response needed to clear influenza virus from the lungs. Current influenza vaccines provide only a weak stimulus to this arm of the adaptive immune response and rely on re-stimulation of CD8 T cell memory related to prior exposure to influenza virus. Efforts to improve vaccine effectiveness in older adults will be fruitless until CD8 responses take center stage.",2020-05-07,Immunity & Ageing,https://openalex.org/V183475463,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00181-1,,,17,1,1,63,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3027752479,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00181-1,journal-article,3027752479

The capacity to synthesize DHA is limited in mammals, despite its critical role in neurological development and health. For humans, DHA is most commonly obtained by eating fish. Global warming is predicted to reduce the de novo synthesis of DHA by algae, at the base of aquatic food chains, and which is expected to reduce DHA transferred to fish. We estimated the global quantity of DHA (total and per capita) currently available from commercial (wild caught and aquaculture) and recreational fisheries. The potential decrease in the amount of DHA available from fish for human consumption was modeled using the predicted effect of established global warming scenarios on algal DHA production and ensuing transfer to fish. We conclude that an increase in water temperature could result, depending on the climate scenario and location, in a ~ 10 to 58% loss of globally available DHA by 2100, potentially limiting the availability of this critical nutrient to humans. Inland waters show the greatest potential for climate-warming-induced decreases in DHA available for human consumption. The projected decrease in DHA availability as a result of global warming would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations (e.g., fetuses, infants), especially in inland Africa (due to low reported per capita DHA availability). We estimated, in the worst-case scenario, that DHA availability could decline to levels where 96% of the global population may not have access to sufficient DHA.",2020-04-01,AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment,https://openalex.org/V46982553,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01234-6,865,880,49,4,1,59,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972642836,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01234-6,journal-article,2972642836

In this article, an radial basis function (RBF) neural network based adaptive robust control design is proposed for nonlinear bilateral teleoperation manipulators to cope with the main issues including the communication time delay, various nonlinearities, and uncertainties. Specifically, the slave environmental dynamics is modeled by a general RBF neural network, and its parameters are estimated and then transmitted for the environmental torque reconstruction in the master side. Since the parameters of the neural network (which are nonpower signals) are transmitted instead of the traditional environmental torque in the communication channel, the previous existing passivity problem under time delay is avoided. In both of master and slave sides, the trajectory creators are applied to generate the desired trajectories, and the RBF-neural-network-based adaptive robust controllers are designed subsequently to handle the nonlinearities and uncertainties. Theoretically, the proposed control algorithm can guarantee the global stability of bilateral teleoperation manipulators under time delay, and the good transparency performance with both position tracking and force feedback is also achieved simultaneously. The real platform comparative experiments are carried out, and the results show the good position tracking to execute precise operation and the good force feedback to detect the sudden disturbance in the environment dynamics.",2020-04-01,IEEE-ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,https://openalex.org/V13961689,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2019.2962081,906,918,25,2,0,58,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997683045,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2019.2962081,journal-article,2997683045

This led to the identification of non-coding RNA in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A pathway (NRAD1), also known as LINC00284. Targeting NRAD1 in TNBC tumors using antisense oligonucleotides reduced cell survival, tumor growth, and the number of cells with CSC characteristics. Expression of NRAD1 is regulated by an enzyme that causes Aldefluor activity in CSCs, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) and its product retinoic acid. Cellular fractionation revealed that NRAD1 is primarily nuclear localized, which suggested a potential function in gene regulation. This was confirmed by transcriptome profiling and chromatin isolation by RNA purification, followed by sequencing (ChIRP-seq), which demonstrated that NRAD1 has enriched chromatin interactions among the genes it regulates. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that NRAD1 regulates expression of genes involved in differentiation and catabolic processes. NRAD1 also contributes to gene expression changes induced by ALDH1A3; thereby, the induction of NRAD1 is a novel mechanism through which ALDH1A3 regulates gene expression. Together, these data identify lncRNA NRAD1 as a downstream effector of ALDH1A3, and a target for TNBCs and CSCs, with functions in cell survival and regulation of gene expression.",2020-01-01,Cell Death & Differentiation,https://openalex.org/V152938505,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-019-0362-1,363,378,27,1,1,52,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2951131565,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-019-0362-1,journal-article,2951131565

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for  potential biases in crude CFR. <h3>METHODS:</h3> We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 3 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%–50%). <h3>RESULTS:</h3> Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%–6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%–3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%–6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%–3.6%). <h3>INTERPRETATION:</h3> Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%.

Al2O3 at four particle size distributions was used to determine the minimum ignition energy (MIE) and maximum explosion pressure (Pmax) of aluminum dust and thus examine the effect of particle size on the inerting efficiency. It was interesting to observe that nano-sized Al2O3 powder showed excellent promise as a solid inertant, having inerting efficacy superior to that of micro-sized Al2O3. In addition to thermal inhibition, nano Al2O3 contributed to explosion moderation by binding Al particles together forming larger-sized aggregates that reduce dispersion in the dust clouds, and thus alleviate explosion hazards. Ignition sensitivity increased when micro-sized Al2O3 was admixed at 5 or 10% with 1000-1500 g/m3 Al mixtures, an effect apparently caused by a 20% decrease in effective particle size distribution brought on by the Al2O3 addition. Generally, increasing the amount of admixed Al2O3 increased MIE and decreased Pmax of Al dust clouds, and decreasing the particle size of Al2O3 resulted in better inerting performance on moderating both the likelihood of the ignition and the consequence of the explosion.",2020-01-05,Journal of Hazardous Materials,https://openalex.org/V145089992,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120968,120968,120968,381,,0,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2965918010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120968,journal-article,2965918010

The safe navigation of ships is of high societal concern. A promising approach for analyzing waterway risks is using non-accident critical events as surrogate indicators of collision accidents. These are typically detected in data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Recognizing the significant interest in this approach, this article provides a review and analysis of methods based on the detection of non-accident critical events from AIS data, which aim to provide insight into maritime waterway risk. Considering also recent calls for increased focus on foundational issues in risk research and safety science, each method in the literature is critically reviewed based on five questions: How are non-accident critical events defined? What is the accident-theoretical basis of the method? How are non-accident critical events ranked? How is the method used? To what extent has the method been validated? Based on the results, it is concluded that focus is needed to build evidence of the validity of the models’ results, if these are to be effectively used for waterway risk analysis.

A relevant compressibility measure for repetitive texts is r , the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transforms (BWTs). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length FM-index, used O ( r ) space and was able to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length m in a text of length n (in O ( m log log n ) time, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of r . In this article, we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the occ occurrences efficiently (in O ( occ log log n ) time) within O ( r ) space. By raising the space to O ( r log log n ), our index counts the occurrences in optimal time, O ( m ), and locates them in optimal time as well, O ( m + occ ). By further raising the space by an O ( w / log σ) factor, where σ is the alphabet size and w = Ω (log n ) is the RAM machine size in bits, we support count and locate in O (⌈ m log (σ)/ w ⌉) and O (⌈ m log (σ)/ w ⌉ + occ ) time, which is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also describe a structure using O ( r log ( n / r )) space that replaces the text and extracts any text substring of length ℓ in the almost-optimal time O (log ( n / r )+ℓ log (σ)/ w ). Within that space, we similarly provide access to arbitrary suffix array, inverse suffix array, and longest common prefix array cells in time O (log ( n / r )), and extend these capabilities to full suffix tree functionality, typically in O (log ( n / r )) time per operation. Our experiments show that our O ( r )-space index outperforms the space-competitive alternatives by 1--2 orders of magnitude in time.

First, we derive a generalized conservation planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82% of real-world examples of climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs, highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers, and we discuss how these could be overcome.

Bayesian network (BN) allows the modelling of failure of systems where the inter-nodal dependencies are represented exclusively by conditional probabilities. Stochastic Petri nets (SPN) enable the study of the dynamic behaviour of complex systems; however, they lack the ability to adapt to changes in the data and operating conditions. This paper proposes a hybrid formalism that strengthens SPN with BN capabilities. The proposed formalism is graphical and uses advance feature such as predicates to perform the data updating functions. This ability enables the analysis of continuous input data without the necessity of time-slice discretization process. The proposed formalism is termed “Bayesian Stochastic Petri Nets” (BSPN). It provides a dynamic assessment of safety by capturing additional sets of data rends.

The genetic, biochemical, and cell biological integration of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont into a heterotrophic host eukaryote approximately a billion years ago paved the way for the evolution of diverse algal groups in a wide range of aquatic and, eventually, terrestrial environments. Plastids have on multiple occasions also moved horizontally from eukaryote to eukaryote by secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events. The overall picture of extant photosynthetic diversity can best be described as “patchy”: Plastid-bearing lineages are spread far and wide across the eukaryotic tree of life, nested within heterotrophic groups. The algae do not constitute a monophyletic entity, and understanding how, and how often, plastids have moved from branch to branch on the eukaryotic tree remains one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in the field of cell evolution. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the origin and spread of plastids from the perspective of comparative genomics. Recent years have seen significant improvements in genomic sampling from photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic lineages, both of which have added important pieces to the puzzle of plastid evolution.

Pouch cells with hybrid graphite-lithium metal anodes cycled with conventional electrolytes fell below 80% capacity in under 1 cycles. However, with a dual-salt electrolyte and applied mechanical pressure optimized for lithium metal cycling, hybrid cells achieved over 15 full (100% utilization) cycles before falling below 80% capacity with a CE of 99.6% for lithium metal plating on graphite. We also found that intermittent high energy (100% utilization) cycles utilizing lithium metal can be dispersed among hundreds of conventional lithium-ion cycles where only the graphite is utilized. Operating the cell with this intermittent protocol shows minimal impact to the underlying graphite capacity. Therefore, these hybrid cells can operate well in “lithium-ion mode” with periodic high energy full cycles accessing the lithium metal capacity.",2020-06-17,Joule,https://openalex.org/V2898305631,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.04.003,1296,1310,4,6,1,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023303604,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.04.003,journal-article,3023303604

However, it is unknown how well these indices relate to a radiologist’s perception of diagnostic image quality. In this study, we compare the image quality scores of five radiologists with the RMSE, SSIM, and other potentially useful IQMs: peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) multi-scale SSIM (MSSSIM), information-weighted SSIM (IWSSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), feature similarity index (FSIM), high dynamic range visible difference predictor (HDRVDP), noise quality metric (NQM), and visual information fidelity (VIF). The comparison uses a database of MR images of the brain and abdomen that have been retrospectively degraded by noise, blurring, undersampling, motion, and wavelet compression for a total of 41 degraded images. A total of 101 subjective scores were assigned by five radiologists. IQM performance was measured via the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC) and statistically significant differences in the residuals of the IQM scores and radiologists’ scores were tested. When considering SROCC calculated from combining scores from all radiologists across all image types, RMSE and SSIM had lower SROCC than six of the other IQMs included in the study (VIF, FSIM, NQM, GMSD, IWSSIM, and HDRVDP).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify studies that investigated the relationship between T2D and VFs. Cohorts providing individual participant data (IPD) were also included. Estimates from published summary data and IPD cohorts were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with T2D and VFs. RESULTS Across 1 studies comprising 852,705 men and women, individuals with T2D had lower risk of prevalent (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% CI 0.74–0.95]; I2 = 0.0%; Phet = 0.54) but increased risk of incident VFs (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.27–1.44]; I2 = 0.6%; Phet = 0.43). In the IPD cohorts (N = 19,820), risk of nonvertebral fractures was higher in those with both T2D and VFs compared with those without T2D or VFs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% CI 1.86–3.15]) or with VFs (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.32–2.27]) or T2D (HR 1.9 [95% CI 1.46–2.59]) alone. Individuals with both T2D and VFs had increased mortality compared with individuals without T2D and VFs (HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.72–2.59]) or with VFs alone (HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.49–2.28]) and borderline increased compared with individuals with T2D alone (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.99–1.52]).

This increase in interconnectivity between systems raises operational efficiency due to the ease of controlling and monitoring of processes, however, this inevitable transformation also exposes the control system to the outside world. As a result, effective security strategies are required as any vulnerability of the SCADA system could generate severe financial and/or safety implications. The primary task when identifying holes in the system is to have proper awareness of the SCADA vulnerabilities and threats. This approach will help to identify potential breaches or aspects in the system where a breach may occur.

Globally, protected areas are being established to protect biodiversity and to promote ecosystem resilience. The typical spatial conservation planning process leading to the creation of these protected areas focuses on representation and replication of ecological features, often using decision support tools such as Marxan. Yet, despite the important role ecological connectivity has in metapopulation persistence and resilience, Marxan currently requires manual input or specialized scripts to explicitly consider connectivity.



2. ‘Marxan Connect’ is a new open source, open access Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool designed to assist conservation planners with the appropriate use of data on ecological connectivity in protected area network planning.



3. Marxan Connect can facilitate the use of estimates of demographic connectivity (e.g. derived from animal tracking data, dispersal models, or genetic tools) or structural landscape connectivity (e.g. isolation by resistance). This is accomplished by calculating metapopulation‐relevant connectivity metrics (e.g. eigenvector centrality) and treating those as conservation features or by including the connectivity data as a spatial dependency amongst sites in the prioritization process.



4. Marxan Connect allows a wide group of users to incorporate directional ecological connectivity into conservation planning with Marxan.

Intuitively, one might answer that it is, given that challenging locomotion externally (e.g., rough terrain) or internally (e.g., age-related impairments) makes our movements more unstable. Here, we investigated how young and old humans synergistically activate muscles during locomotion when different perturbation levels are introduced. Of these control signals, called muscle synergies, we analyzed the local stability and the complexity (or irregularity) over time. Surprisingly, we found that perturbations force the central nervous system to produce muscle activation patterns that are less unstable and less complex. These outcomes show that robust locomotion control in challenging settings is achieved by producing less complex control signals that are more stable over time, whereas easier tasks allow for more unstable and irregular control.",2020-01-24,iScience,https://openalex.org/V2898358376,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.100796,100796,100796,23,1,1,36,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997681105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.100796,journal-article,2997681105

Single-use plastics (SUPs) have short lifespans, and most of this waste is generated by packaging from global food industries. Food packaging waste comprises approximately one-third (8 million tonnes) of all Canadian municipal solid waste, and only 20% is recovered for reuse or recycling. Extended producer responsibility (EPR) strategies leverage corporate resources to reduce SUP waste generated by consumers. Implementation of EPR strategies allows local jurisdictions to gain greater control over their waste streams. Although Canada has had a national EPR strategy since 2009, it is currently only implemented for packaging in five provinces (e.g., British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Québec), and is currently under development in New Brunswick. In this short communication, a case example of EPR implementation in Nova Scotia is provided which highlights the potential economic benefits for municipalities ($14-17 M CAD in estimated savings), for improved solid waste management and for increasing recycling rates.

Thus, enhancing the situational awareness of the stand-on ship is a key for navigational safety, where the intention estimation of the give-way ship is crucial. According to COLREGs, the stand-on ship is not allowed to take evasive actions until the give-way ship does not take proper actions timely. The stage that needs the stand-on ship to take actions plays as the second protective layer for the ship, which is named as ‘Stand-on Ship as Second Line of Defense’ (SLoD). A method to estimate the intention of the give-way ship and to trigger SLoD is proposed in this article. Four modules of the proposed method include: “data pre-processing” collects all traffic information and determines the ships' obligations; “action identification” pinpoints the turning points; “action uncertainty” generates a bounded reachable velocity considering the give-way ship's maneuverability; “conflict assessment” judges potential collision by using non-linear velocity obstacle algorithm. Several typical encounter scenarios are simulated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

This study aims to identify and describe the literature surrounding the needs of caregivers of PWD and the solutions identified to meet these needs. Method: A literature search was performed in: PsycInfo, Medline, CINAHL, SCIELO and LILACS, January 2007–January 2018. Two independent reviewers evaluated 1,661 abstracts, and full-text screening was subsequently performed for 5 articles. The scoping review consisted of 3 studies, which were evaluated according to sociodemographic characteristics, methodological approach, and caregiver’s experiences, realities, and needs. To help extract and organize reported caregiver needs, we used the C.A.R.E. Tool as a guiding framework. Results: Thirty-one studies were identified. The most common needs were related to personal health (58% emotional health; 32% physical health) and receiving help from others (55%). Solutions from the articles reviewed primarily concerned information gaps (55%) and the education/learning needs of caregivers (52%). Conclusion: This review identified the needs of caregivers of PWD. Caregivers’ personal health emerged as a key area of need, while provision of information was identified as a key area of support. Future studies should explore the changes that occur in needs over the caregiving trajectory and consider comparing caregivers’ needs across different countries.",2020-01-01,International Psychogeriatrics,https://openalex.org/V175287009,,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610219000243,35,52,32,1,1,31,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2937058978,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610219000243,journal-article,2937058978

However, less is known about the relationship between AD-related pathology and the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) commonly presented by patients. This review discusses the BPSD-like behaviours recapitulated by several mouse models of AD-related pathology, including the APP/PS1, Tg2576, 3xTg-AD, 5xFAD, and APP23 models. Current evidence suggests that social withdrawal and depressive-like behaviours increase with progressive neuropathology, and increased aggression and sleep-wake disturbances are present even at early stages; however, there is no clear evidence to support increased anxiety-like behaviours, agitation (hyperactivity), or general apathy. Overall, transgenic mouse models of AD-related pathology recapitulate some of the BPSD-like behaviours associated with AD, but these behaviours vary by model. This reflects the patient population, where AD patients typically exhibit one or more BPSD, but rarely all symptoms at once. As a result, we suggest that transgenic mouse models are an important tool to investigate the pathology underlying BPSD in human AD patients.",2020-02-15,Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews,https://openalex.org/V170052170,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.02.012,634,647,112,,0,31,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006131455,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.02.012,journal-article,3006131455

Well known for Chlamydiaceae, pathogens of humans and other animals, Chlamydiae also include so-called environmental lineages that primarily infect microbial eukaryotes. Environmental surveys indicate that Chlamydiae are found in a wider range of environments than anticipated previously. However, the vast majority of this chlamydial diversity has been underexplored, biasing our current understanding of their biology, ecological importance, and evolution. Here, we report that previously undetected and active chlamydial lineages dominate microbial communities in deep anoxic marine sediments taken from the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Reaching relative abundances of up to 43% of the bacterial community, and a maximum diversity of 16 different species-level taxonomic units, these Chlamydiae represent important community members. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we reconstructed 2 draft chlamydial genomes, expanding by over a third the known genomic diversity in this phylum. Phylogenomic analyses revealed several novel clades across the phylum, including a previously unknown sister lineage of the Chlamydiaceae, providing new insights into the origin of pathogenicity in this family. We were unable to identify putative eukaryotic hosts for these marine sediment chlamydiae, despite identifying genomic features that may be indicative of host-association. The high abundance and genomic diversity of Chlamydiae in these anoxic marine sediments indicate that some members could play an important, and thus far overlooked, ecological role in such environments and may indicate alternate lifestyle strategies. Dharamshi et al. find abundant, diverse, and active Chlamydiae in deep anoxic marine sediments. Using metagenomics, chlamydial genomes are obtained that form several new clades.

This problem can be overcome by adding presorting centers in the CLSC network since presorting costs are typically lower than the costs incurred at subsequent processing stages. Presorting centers can separate poor quality products at the start of the reverse logistics cycle and reduce transportation costs and emissions. In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model and its robust variant are proposed to investigate the effects of the quality of returns on the CLSC network under the carbon cap (CC) and carbon cap-and-trade (CCT) policies. Numerical experiments conducted with data from a real resource recovery company show the effects of varying return quality on total emissions and profit, the impact of presorting center efficiency and transportation cost on the opening of presorting centers, and the impacts of CC and CCT policies on the configuration of the CLSC network. The main insight of this paper is that the carbon cap policy affects the network structure much more than does the carbon cap and trade policy.",2020-02-20,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119086,119086,119086,247,,0,30,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987668192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119086,journal-article,2987668192

While some patients achieve remission using mood-stabilizing treatments, a significant proportion of patients show progressive changes in symptomatology over time. Bipolar progression is diverse in nature and may include a treatment-resistant increase in the frequency and severity of episodes, worse psychiatric and functional outcomes, and a greater risk of suicide. The mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder progression remain poorly understood and there are currently no biomarkers for identifying patients at risk. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of blood-brain barrier (BBB) imaging as such a biomarker, by acquiring the first imaging data of BBB leakage in bipolar patients, and evaluating the potential association between BBB dysfunction and bipolar symptoms. To this end, a cohort of 3 bipolar patients was recruited through the Mood Disorders Clinic (Nova Scotia Health Authority, Canada). All patients, along with 1 control subjects (matched for sex, age and metabolic status), underwent contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI scanning for quantitative assessment of BBB leakage as well as clinical and psychiatric evaluations. Outlier analysis has identified a group of 1 subjects with significantly higher percentages of brain volume with BBB leakage (labeled the “extensive BBB leakage” group). This group consisted exclusively of bipolar patients, while the “normal BBB leakage” group included the entire control cohort and the remaining 2 bipolar subjects. Among the bipolar cohort, patients with extensive BBB leakage were found to have more severe depression and anxiety, and a more chronic course of illness. Furthermore, all bipolar patients within this group were also found to have co-morbid insulin resistance, suggesting that insulin resistance may increase the risk of BBB dysfunction in bipolar patients. Our findings demonstrate a clear link between BBB leakage and greater psychiatric morbidity in bipolar patients and highlight the potential of BBB imaging as a mechanism-based biomarker for bipolar disorder progression.",2020-01-01,NeuroImage: Clinical,https://openalex.org/V2898194095,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102049,102049,102049,26,,1,29,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981580852,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102049,journal-article,2981580852

We tested an integrative model in which CEO beliefs about diversity were theorized to predict the implementation of organizational diversity practices through two consecutive mediating steps—via greater CEO engagement in pro-diversity behavior, and in turn, higher perceived CEO commitment by their HR manager. In this model, we also proposed a moderating effect such that when CEOs have less positive beliefs about diversity, CEOs espousing higher moral values will display greater pro-diversity behavior.

There is an increased understanding that motor dysfunction contributes to overall AD severity, and a need to ameliorate these impairments. The 5xFAD mouse develops the neuropathology, cognitive and motor impairments observed in AD, and thus may be a valuable animal model to study motor deficits in AD. Therefore, we assessed age-related changes in motor ability of male and female 5xFAD mice from  to 1 months of age, using a battery of behavioral tests. At 9-10 months, 5xFAD mice showed reduced body weight, reduced rearing in the open-field and impaired performance on the rotarod compared to wild-type controls. At 12-13 months, 5xFAD mice showed reduced locomotor activity on the open-field, and impaired balance on the balance beam. At 15-16 months, impairments were also seen in grip strength. Although sex differences were observed at specific ages, the development of motor dysfunction was similar in male and female mice. Given the 5xFAD mouse is commonly on a C57BL/6 × SJL hybrid background, a subset of mice may be homozygous recessive for the Dysf im mutant allele, which leads to muscular weakness in SJL mice and may exacerbate motor dysfunction. We found small effects of Dysf im on motor function, suggesting that Dysf im contributes little to motor dysfunction in 5xFAD mice. We conclude that the 5xFAD mouse may be a useful model to study mechanisms that produce motor dysfunction in AD, and to assess the efficacy of therapeutics on ameliorating motor impairment.",2020-03-01,"Genes, Brain and Behavior",https://openalex.org/V134433296,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12538,,,19,3,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2900777427,https://doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12538,journal-article,2900777427

However, there is a need for long-term data (over centennial or millennial timescales) to better understand natural community dynamics and the processes that govern the observed trends. Chironomids (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are often the most abundant insects in lake ecosystems, sensitive to environmental change, and, because their larval exoskeleton head capsules preserve well in lake sediments, they provide a unique record of insect community dynamics through time. Here, we provide the results of a metadata analysis of chironomid diversity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. First, we analyse spatial trends in chironomid diversity using Northern Hemispheric data sets overall consisting of 837 lakes. Our results indicate that in most of our data sets, summer temperature (Tjul) is strongly associated with spatial trends in modern-day chironomid diversity. We observe a strong increase in chironomid alpha diversity with increasing Tjul in regions with present-day Tjul between 2.5 and 14°C. In some areas with Tjul > 14°C, chironomid diversity stabilizes or declines. Second, we demonstrate that the direction and amplitude of change in alpha diversity in a compilation of subfossil chironomid records spanning the last glacial–interglacial transition (~15,000–11,000 years ago) are similar to those observed in our modern data. A compilation of Holocene records shows that during phases when the amplitude of temperature change was small, site-specific factors had a greater influence on the chironomid fauna obscuring the chironomid diversity–temperature relationship. Our results imply expected overall chironomid diversity increases in colder regions such as the Arctic under sustained global warming, but with complex and not necessarily predictable responses for individual sites.",2020-03-01,Global Change Biology,https://openalex.org/V74970393,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14862,1155,1169,26,3,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980224233,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14862,journal-article,2980224233

In Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), four large chromosomal rearrangements have been associated with ecological gradients and migratory behavior in regional analyses. However, the degree of parallelism, the extent of independent inheritance, and functional distinctiveness of these rearrangements remain poorly understood. Here, we use a 12K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to demonstrate extensive individual variation in rearrangement genotype within populations across the species range, suggesting that local adaptation to fine-scale ecological variation is enabled by rearrangements with independent inheritance. Our results demonstrate significant association of rearrangements with migration phenotype and environmental gradients across the species range. Individual rearrangements exhibit functional modularity, but also contain loci showing multiple environmental associations. Clustering in genetic distance trees and reduced differentiation within rearrangements across the species range are consistent with shared variation as a source of contemporary adaptive diversity in Atlantic cod. Conversely, we also find that haplotypes in the LG1 and LG rearranged region have diverged across the Atlantic, despite consistent environmental associations. Exchange of these structurally variable genomic regions, as well as local selective pressures, has likely facilitated individual diversity within Atlantic cod stocks.

The application of this work is related to the temperature control of a finned PV panel filled with PCM and installed at different tilt angles. The studied system is modeled as a 2D rectangular enclosure filled with PCM (RT25) and packed between two aluminum plates, where the front side is exposed to a constant heat flux of 1000 W/m2 for 2 h. Four geometries were considered including a non-finned PCM enclosure, a PCM enclosure with one centered full-width fin, one half-width fin attached to the front plate, and one half-width fin attached to the back plate. Results have shown that the most efficient thermal management of the PV-PCM panel is obtained when the PCM enclosure is equipped with a full-width fin simultaneously attached to the front and back plates. With such a PV panel design, the PCM melting is dominated by natural convection heat transfer from both sides of the PCM enclosure at an early stage, with added heat losses from the back plate to the external environment. Accordingly, low values of the front and back plates temperatures can be maintained during a stabilization time of 80 min as long as the tilt angle is varied from 0° to 75° from the vertical. The efficient temperature control resulting from the full-width fin geometry is mainly related to the high overall heat transfer coefficient obtained during the whole melting process.",2020-05-01,International Journal of Thermal Sciences,https://openalex.org/V128740003,Elsevier,https://hal.uca.fr/hal-02495439,,,,,0,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000484331,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2020.106260,journal-article,3000484331

The present observational study aims to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and course of individuals with ACO based on various definitions used in clinical practice. Methods We included individuals with COPD from the prospective, multisite CanCOLD study and defined subjects with ACO using seven definitions commonly used in the literature. Results Data including questionnaires, lung function and CT scans were analysed from 52 individuals with COPD who were randomly recruited from the population. Among them, 26 fulfilled at least one of the seven definitions of ACO. Prevalence of ACO varied from 3.8% to 31%. Regardless of the definition, individuals with ACO had worse outcomes (lung function and higher percentage of fast decliners, symptoms and exacerbations, health-related quality of life and comorbidities) than the remaining patients with COPD. Conversely, patients with non-ACO had higher emphysema and bronchiolitis scores. The three definitions that included atopy and/or physician diagnosis of asthma identified subjects who differed significantly from patients with COPD.

As an emerging technology, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) has the potential to inactivate L. monocytogenes in packaged RTE meats. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of treatment time, modified atmosphere gas compositions (MAP), ham formulation, and post-treatment storage (1 and 7 days at 4 °C) on the reduction of a five-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes and quality changes in ham subjected to in-package ACP treatment. Initial average cells population on ham surfaces were  log CFU/cm2 . The ACP treatment time and gas composition significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the inactivation of L. monocytogenes, irrespective of ham formulations. When MAP (20% O2 + 40% CO2 + 40% N2 ) was used, there was a significantly higher log reduction (> log reduction) in L. monocytogenes on ham in comparison to MAP (50% CO2 + 50% N2 ) and MAP (100% CO2 ), irrespective of ham formulation. Addition of preservatives (that is, 0.1% sodium diacetate and 1.4% sodium lactate) or bacteriocins (that is, 0.05% of a partially purified culture ferment from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL 307) did not significantly reduce cell counts of L. monocytogenes after ACP treatment. Regardless of type of ham, storage of 2 hr after ACP treatment significantly reduced cells counts of L. monocytogenes to approximately 4 log CFU/cm2 . Following 7 days of storage after ACP treatment, L. monocytogenes counts were below the detection limit (> log reduction) when samples were stored in MAP1. However, there were significant changes in lipid oxidation and color after post-treatment storage. In conclusion, the antimicrobial efficacy of ACP is strongly influenced by gas composition inside the package and post-treatment storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Surface contamination of RTE ham with L. monocytogenes may occur during processing steps such as slicing and packaging. In-package ACP is an emerging nonthermal technology, which can be used as a postpackaging decontamination step in industrial settings. This study demonstrated the influence of in-package gas composition, treatment time, post-treatment storage, and ham formulation on L. monocytogenes inactivation efficacy of ACP. Results of present study will be helpful to optimize in-package ACP treatment and storage conditions to reduce L. monocytogenes, while maintaining the quality of ham.",2020-03-02,Journal of Food Science,https://openalex.org/V23579880,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15072,1203,1212,85,4,0,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010253668,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15072,journal-article,3010253668

In line with these developments, process safety research is also developing rapidly in China. This paper aims to present insights in the progress of process safety research in China using bibliometric analysis. The results indicate that in China the most productive authors, institutions, and provinces are located in economically developed coastal areas and in areas with more universities specializing in safety science and engineering. As for the international cooperation, the most significant collaborating countries are economically developed countries or China’s neighbors, and these countries have published a large number of papers important in this field. The citation analysis shows that Chinese process safety research currently still has a relatively limited international impact. The analysis of hot topics shows that there currently are very few new methods or research topics introduced in recent years, and there is still significant room for the Chinese research community to improve in some subdomains of the research field. Based on these trends and apparent shortcomings in the literature, future research directions are proposed. The results contribute to understanding the overall situation of process safety research in China, and can serve as a high-level synthesis of the research field.

However, in bilingual situations, the relationship between maternal education and input is more complex because education may have occurred in one, but not both, of the languages. This study details this complexity by examining the relationship between maternal education and linguistic input in a group of children learning English as a second language (L2). Method: Participants were 89 immigrant/refugee children, living in Canada with diverse first languages (L1s). They completed a story-telling task in their L2 and parent reports provided a measure of L1 development. Parents also answered detailed questionnaires about family demographics and linguistic input within the family. Results: Regression modeling revealed that cumulative exposure to the L2 in school, maternal L2 fluency, relative quantity of L1/L2 use by the mother (input) and by the child (output) all influenced children’s L1 and L2 development. Relative quantity of input and maternal L2 fluency were, in turn, influenced by the amount of education mothers had completed and the language in which that education occurred. In instances where mothers were educated primarily in the L1, higher levels of education were associated with relatively more L input. For mothers who were educated predominantly in the L2, higher levels of education were associated with relatively more L2 input. Across both groups, mothers with higher levels of education had higher L2 fluency. Conclusion: This study revealed a complex relationship between the amount of education a mother has, the language in which that education occurred and the linguistic input she provides to her children. This complexity highlights that monolingual studies about input and environment may not offer a sufficiently nuanced perspective to account for the greater levels of variability found in bilingual situations. Originality: Previous research has offered valuable insights into the relationship between individual difference factors and bilingual acquisition.

Existing quasiclassical dynamics methods based on mapping, such as the linearised semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) approaches, have been shown to fail in predicting the correct relaxation of electronic-state populations following an initial excitation. Here we generalise our recently published modification to the standard quasiclassical approximation for simulating quantum correlation functions. We show that the electronic-state population operator in any system can be exactly rewritten as a sum of a traceless operator and the identity operator. We show that by treating the latter at a quantum level instead of using the mapping approach, the accuracy of traditional quasiclassical dynamics methods can be drastically improved, without changes to their underlying equations of motion. We demonstrate this approach for the seven-state Frenkel-Exciton model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light harvesting complex, showing that our modification significantly improves the accuracy of traditional mapping approaches when compared to numerically exact quantum results.",2020-01-01,Faraday Discussions,https://openalex.org/V193234216,The Royal Society of Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9fd00050j,150,167,221,,1,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977053571,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9fd00050j,journal-article,2977053571

We investigate Ohio, a state with one of the highest overdose death rates in 201 and substantial numbers of deaths related to fentanyl, carfentanil, and other fentanyl analogs, to provide detailed evidence about the relationship between changes in the illicit drug market and overdose deaths. Methods We investigate the illicit drug market using Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation's (BCI) crime lab data from 200 to 201 that shows the content of drugs seized by law enforcement. We use Poisson regression analysis to estimate the relationship between monthly crime lab data and monthly unintentional drug overdose death data at the county level. Results During this time period there has been a rapid change in the composition of drugs analyzed by the BCI labs, with a rapid fall in heroin observations, simultaneous rise in synthetic opioids, and an increase in the number of different fentanyl analogs. We find that the increased presence of fentanyl, carfentanil, and other fentanyl analogs have a strong correlation with an increase in overdose deaths. The types of opioids most associated with deaths varies by the population size of the county.

Much work focuses on technical developments and discussions on legal, economic, and safety and security implications. There has been less focus and discussion on the role of different societal actors in the decision-making processes concerning the conceptualization, design, and operational implementation of these future vessels. This paper contributes to this discussion by framing the introduction of MASS in a risk governance context. After briefly introducing the International Risk Governance Council’s Risk Governance Framework, the different degrees of autonomy of MASS are categorized according to their dominant risk characteristics. Subsequently, implications are drawn for the recommended risk governance strategies in approaching MASS development and implementation, and some future research areas are identified. It is argued that with higher degrees of autonomy, complexities and uncertainties become more important, necessitating an approach to MASS design and implementation where multiple affected stakeholders are included. A reflective discourse is recommended. For MASS degree of autonomy three and four, normative ambiguities may be present. In such cases, a participative discourse is recommended, where a wider societal debate is held regarding appropriate actions.",2020-08-01,Safety Science,https://openalex.org/V123149298,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104758,104758,104758,128,,0,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3020411317,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104758,journal-article,3020411317

To date, such studies have largely focused on animals, fungi, and land plants (primarily multicellular eukaryotes); relatively few mitochondrial proteomes from protists (primarily unicellular eukaryotic microbes) have been examined. To gauge the full extent of mitochondrial structural and functional complexity and to identify potential evolutionary trends in mitochondrial proteomes, more comprehensive explorations of phylogenetically diverse mitochondrial proteomes are required. In this regard, a key group is the jakobids, a clade of protists belonging to the eukaryotic supergroup Discoba, distinguished by having the most gene-rich and most bacteria-like mitochondrial genomes discovered to date. Results In this study, we assembled the draft nuclear genome sequence for the jakobid Andalucia godoyi and used a comprehensive in silico approach to infer the nucleus-encoded portion of the mitochondrial proteome of this protist, identifying 864 candidate mitochondrial proteins. The A. godoyi mitochondrial proteome has a complexity that parallels that of other eukaryotes, while exhibiting an unusually large number of ancestral features that have been lost particularly in opisthokont (animal and fungal) mitochondria. Notably, we find no evidence that the A. godoyi nuclear genome has or had a gene encoding a single-subunit, T3/T7 bacteriophage-like RNA polymerase, which functions as the mitochondrial transcriptase in all eukaryotes except the jakobids. Conclusions As genome and mitochondrial proteome data have become more widely available, a strikingly punctuate phylogenetic distribution of different mitochondrial components has been revealed, emphasizing that the pathways of mitochondrial proteome evolution are likely complex and lineage-specific. Unraveling this complexity will require comprehensive comparative analyses of mitochondrial proteomes from a phylogenetically broad range of eukaryotes, especially protists.

Trip planning activities considered in the study include performing online tasks, deciding departure time, mode choice decision, deciding trip destination and communicating and coordinating trips by using smartphones. Travel outcomes include the number of new places visited, social gatherings attended and trips planned in groups. This study emphasizes the role of built-environment and attitudinal variables on smartphone use for travel. Following ordered response and binary choice modeling approach, this study identifies that age and attitudes (toward smartphone use and environment) play a significant role in using smartphones for trip planning as well as shaping travel outcomes. Millennials (16–34 years) are more likely to use smartphones for trip planning and perceive increase in travel outcomes compared to other age groups. In addition, tech-savvy attitude is positively associated with trip planning and travel outcomes.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing, several methods now exist for resolving fine-scale population structure, but the comparative performance of these methods for genetic assignment has rarely been tested. Here, we evaluate the performance of sequenced microsatellites and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to resolve fine-scale population structure in a critically important salmonid in north eastern Canada, Arctic Charr (Salvelinus alpinus). We also assess the utility of sequenced microsatellites for fisheries applications by quantifying the spatial scales of movement and exploitation through genetic assignment of fishery samples to rivers of origin and comparing these results with a 29-year tagging dataset. Self-assignment and simulation-based analyses of 11 genome-wide microsatellite loci and 50 informative SNPs from 2 populations of Arctic Charr in north-eastern Canada identified largely river-specific genetic structure. Despite large differences (~4X) in the number of loci surveyed between panels, mean self-assignment accuracy was similar with the microsatellite loci and the SNP panel (>90%). Subsequent analysis of 99 fishery-collected samples using the microsatellite panel revealed that larger rivers contribute greater numbers of individuals to the fishery and that coastal fisheries largely exploit individuals originating from nearby rivers, corroborating results from traditional tagging experiments.

In specific fields such as oncology and hematology, precision medicine has already started to be implemented in the clinical setting and molecular testing is routinely used to select treatments with higher efficacy and reduced adverse effects. The application of precision medicine in psychiatry is still in its early phases. However, there are already examples of predictive models based on clinical data or combinations of clinical, neuroimaging and biological data. While the power of single clinical predictors would remain inadequate if analyzed only with traditional statistical approaches, these predictors are now increasingly used to impute machine learning models that can have adequate accuracy even in the presence of relatively small sample size. These models have started to be applied to disentangle relevant clinical questions that could lead to a more effective management of psychiatric disorders, such as prediction of response to the mood stabilizer lithium, resistance to antidepressants in major depressive disorder or stratification of the risk and outcome prediction in schizophrenia.

To gauge the state of the field, we reviewed and coded a sample set of papers (n = 105) concerning farmers' perceptions of climate change. Crosstabulation analysis reveals that: 1) researching farmer “perception” of climate change seems to be more frequent in the Global South, as opposed to the North, where other terms are used; 2) farmers are rarely described within their social-ecological contexts, and often simply have their observations segmented and assessed for verification against historical data or quantitative measurements; and 3) the broader dynamics of research practice may perpetuate extractive and colonial patterns of exchange between the Global North and South. We find that farmers from the Global South are rarely described, but often evaluated in their perceptions. We conclude that, with some exceptions, the field does not substantively embrace farmers’ perceptions as a contribution to adaptation discourse.

Individuals with WMS present with short stature, joint contractures, thick skin, microspherophakia, small and dislocated lenses, and cardiac valve anomalies. WMS can be caused by recessive mutations in ADAMTS1 (WMS 1), ADAMTS17 (WMS 4), or LTBP2 (WMS 3), or by dominant mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) (WMS 2); all genes encode secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Individuals with WMS 4 due to ADAMTS17 mutations appear to have less severe cardiac involvement and present predominantly with the musculoskeletal and ocular features of WMS. ADAMTS17 is a member of the ADAMT family of secreted proteases and directly binds to fibrillins. Here we report a novel pathogenic variant in ADAMTS17 that causes WMS 4 in an individual with short stature, brachydactyly, and small, spherical, and dislocated lenses. We provide biochemical and cell biological insights in the pathomechanisms of WMS 4, which also suggest potential biological functions for ADAMTS17.

Driven by exclusivity or conformity, consumers are classified as either snobs or conformists, with uncertain preferences about the product. The manufacturer can obtain a private signal on this preference, while the retailer cannot. Results show that the manufacturer makes different market-targeting schedules in response to different signals. Interestingly, the manufacturer may benefit from either a no-information, a private-information, or an information-sharing policy, depending on its market-targeting strategy.

A Magic Spell of Social Glue?: Sharing a Smart Voice Assistant Speaker and Its Impact on Users’ Perception of Group Harmony,"Unlike most other computing devices that are known to isolate their users, Smart Voice Assistant Speaker (SVAS) appears to improve the perception of social cohesion (i.e., Group Harmony) among its co-users. We hypothesize that the social cues emanated from the continued, and habituated, use of SVAS develop the “illusion of intimacy” which, in turn, ripples through the entire group, and help fulfill the need for social integration. The data collected from 218 families support this hypothesis. We argue that just as a puppy dog contributes to a happy family, so does the SVAS contributes to the social dynamics by making the users unconsciously fulfill their psychological needs and by increasing actual conversations among its users. Incidentally, the study compared the relative influence of three factors (the beta weight of “Hedonic Motivation” being the highest, followed by “Compatibility,” and then “Perceived Security”) that, as a whole, explain over 60% of the variance in Satisfaction of post-adoption SVAS use.",2020-06-01,Information Systems Frontiers,https://openalex.org/V181659395,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09975-1,563,583,22,3,0,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996435796,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09975-1,journal-article,2996435796

Lysosomal autophagy promotes cancer survival through the degradation of toxic molecules and the maintenance of adequate nutrient supply. Doxorubicin (DOX) is the standard of care treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, chemoresistance at lower doses and toxicity at higher doses limit its usefulness. By targeting pathways of survival, DOX can become an effective antitumor agent. In this study, we examined the role of TFEB in TNBC and its relationship with autophagy and DNA damage induced by DOX. In TNBC cells, TFEB was hypo-phosphorylated and localized to the nucleus upon DOX treatment. TFEB knockdown decreased the viability of TNBC cells while increasing caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Additionally, inhibition of the TFEB-phosphatase calcineurin sensitized cells to DOX-induced apoptosis in a TFEB dependent fashion. Regulation of apoptosis by TFEB was not a consequence of altered lysosomal function, as TFEB continued to protect against apoptosis in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors. RNA-Seq analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with TFEB silencing identified a down-regulation in cell cycle and homologous recombination genes while interferon-γ and death receptor signaling genes were up-regulated. In consequence, TFEB knockdown disrupted DNA repair following DOX, as evidenced by persistent γH2A.X detection.

In this pilot study, we have obtained 870-μm continuum maps of an essentially complete sample of the brightest 18 sub-millimetre sources ($S_{850\, \mu \rm m}\gt $ 6.2 mJy) in COSMOS. Our ALMA maps detect 26 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) spanning a range in flux density of $S_{870\, \mu \rm m}$ = 0.7–19.2 mJy. We detect more than one SMG counterpart in 3 ±  per cent of sub-millimetre sources, increasing to 5 ±  per cent for SCUBA-2 sources brighter than $S_{850\, \mu \rm m}\gt $ 1 mJy. We estimate that approximately one-third of these SMG–SMG pairs are physically associated (with a higher rate for the brighter secondary SMGs, $S_{870\, \mu \rm m}\gtrsim$  mJy), and illustrate this with the serendipitous detection of bright [C ii] 157.74-μm line emission in two SMGs, AS2COS 0001. and 0001. at z = 4.63, associated with the highest significance single-dish source.

This work proposes and evaluates a machine learning based system for user-centered insider threat detection. Using machine learning, analysis of data is performed on multiple levels of granularity under realistic conditions for identifying not only malicious behaviours, but also malicious insiders. Detailed analysis of popular insider threat scenarios with different performance measures are presented to facilitate the realistic estimation of system performance. Evaluation results show that the machine learning based detection system can learn from limited ground truth and detect new malicious insiders in unseen data with a high accuracy. Specifically, up to 85% of malicious insiders are detected at only 0.78% false positive rate. The system is also able to quickly detect the malicious behaviours, as low as 14 minutes after the first malicious action.

While there has been substantial focus on risks and negative outcomes associated with youth migrancy, there is limited evidence of the relationship between the adversity of migration, and resilience, wellbeing, and positive mental health in adolescents. This international study aimed to explore the differences in resilience, wellbeing, and mental health behaviors in migrant and non-migrant adolescents tested across six countries (Australia, New Zealand, UK, China, South Africa, and Canada) with varying levels of trauma exposure. The study was a cross-sectional survey design with a convenience sample of 194 10-17 year old migrants and non-migrants. The migrant sample included both ""internal"" migrants (change of residence within a country) and ""external"" migrants (change of residence across national borders) for comparison. Across the sites, migrants reported a higher mean number of traumatic events for the past year than non-migrants, with internal migrants reporting more events than external migrants overall. South African adolescents reported a higher mean number of traumatic events for the past year than all other sites. External migrants reported higher resilience scores yet reduced prosocial behaviors relative to internal migrants and non-migrants, whereas both internal and external migrants reported higher peer problems than non-migrants. When considering the interacting effects of trauma, the presence or absence of trauma did not appear to impact migrant scores in terms of resilience, wellbeing, or conduct problems. In comparison, trauma-exposed non-migrants showed detriments relative to trauma-exposed migrant peers for all of these measures. In conclusion, the survey tool was found to be reliable and acceptable for use in international studies of different samples of adolescent migrants. Overall, migrant adolescents showed greater resilience resources than non-migrants and, although the migrants experienced more traumatic events, the impact of trauma on mental health outcomes was greater in the non-migrants. There is a need for further research with larger prospective sample sizes to investigate how levels of resilience and wellbeing vary over time and across countries, and the ways resilience can be promoted in adolescents exposed to trauma, regardless of migrancy status.",2020-03-09,Frontiers in Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V92766711,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00997,,,10,,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006581284,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00997,journal-article,3006581284

The introduction of induced pluripotent stem cell methodology enabled better modeling of this disorder.Having previously studied the phenotype of dentate gyrus granule neurons, we turned our attention to studying the phenotype of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of  patients with BD compared with  control individuals. We used patch clamp and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure electrophysiological features and RNA expression by specific channel genes.We found that BD CA3 neurons were hyperexcitable only when they were derived from patients who responded to lithium; they featured sustained activity with large current injections and a large, fast after-hyperpolarization, similar to what we previously reported in dentate gyrus neurons. The higher amplitudes and faster kinetics of fast potassium currents correlated with this hyperexcitability. Further supporting the involvement of potassium currents, we observed an overexpression of KCNC and KCNC in hippocampal neurons derived from lithium responders. Applying specific potassium channel blockers diminished the hyperexcitability. Long-term lithium treatment decreased the hyperexcitability observed in the CA3 neurons derived from lithium responders while increasing sodium currents and reducing fast potassium currents. When differentiating this cohort into spinal motor neurons, we did not observe any changes in the excitability of BD motor neurons compared with control motor neurons.The hyperexcitability of BD neurons is neuronal type specific with the involvement of altered potassium currents that allow for a sustained, continued firing activity.",2020-07-15,Biological Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V205482884,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.09.018,139,149,88,2,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978766119,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.09.018,journal-article,2978766119

Here, several semiempirical and density-functional theory (DFT) methods are assessed for their ability to describe the potential energy surface and reaction energies of the covalent modification of a thiol by an electrophile. Functionals such as PBE and B3LYP fail to predict a stable enolate intermediate. This is largely due to delocalization error, which spuriously stabilizes the prereaction complex, in which excess electron density is transferred from the thiolate to the electrophile. Functionals with a high-exact exchange component, range-separated DFT functionals, and variationally optimized exact exchange (i.e., the LC-B05minV functional) correct this issue to various degrees. The large gradient behavior of the exchange enhancement factor is also found to significantly affect the results, leading to the improved performance of PBE0. While ωB97X-D and M06-2X were reasonably accurate, no method provided quantitative accuracy for all three electrophiles, making this a very strenuous test of functional performance. Additionally, one drawback of M06-2X was that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using this functional were only stable if a fine integration grid was used.

This behavior contrasts sharply with the expected evolution of large, hot orogens formed by collision of lithospheres with laterally uniform properties. Motivated by this problem, we use two-dimensional numerical geodynamical model experiments to show that the enigmatic behavior of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny can result from crust-mantle decoupling, transport of crust relative to the mantle lithosphere, and diverse styles of lithospheric mantle delamination, which emerge self-consistently as phases in the evolution of the system. These model styles are explained by contrasting inherited mantle lithosphere properties of the Asian upper-plate accreted terranes. Deformation and lithospheric delamination preferentially localize in terranes with the most dense and weak mantle lithosphere, first in the Qiangtang and then in the Lhasa mantle lithospheres. The model results are shown to be consistent with 11 observed complexities in the evolution of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen. The broad implication is that all large orogens containing previously accreted terranes are expected to have an idiosyncratic evolution determined by the properties of these terranes, and will be shown to deviate from predictions of uniform lithosphere models.",2020-01-01,Geology,https://openalex.org/V56162041,Geological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46701.1,8,14,48,1,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982292370,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46701.1,journal-article,2982292370

Haskap ( Lonicera caerulea L.) is a recently commercialized fruit crop in Canada. Berries of four cultivars, Aurora, Rebecca, Larissa, and Evie, were harvested at five harvesting dates (H1-H5) and assessed for their polyphenol composition and anti-diabetic potential in vitro . The analyses revealed that the interaction effect of cultivar and harvesting date influenced the concentration of anthocyanins. Cyanidin-3- O -glucoside represents about 79 % of total anthocyanins present in ripened haskap berries. Total anthocyanins estimated by a non-destructive method showed a strong correlation for quantified anthocyanin by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS), indicating the potential application of the non-destructive method for deciding the berry maturity for mechanical harvesting of haskap berry for value-added processing.

In addition, (3) women's genital responses do not strongly correspond with self-reported sexual partner and activity preferences, or (4) with self-reported sexual arousal during the presentation of sexual stimuli. Taken together, these facts represent a puzzle, especially considering that men's genital responses are highly affected by specific sexual cues and strongly correspond to stated preferences and self-reported sexual arousal. One hypothesis to explain female low cue-specificity and low concordance (relative to men) is the preparation hypothesis: Women's indiscriminate genital responses serve a protective function. That is, they do not indicate or necessarily promote sexual interest and motivation, but rather prepare the vaginal lumen for possible sexual activity and therefore prevent injuries that may occur as a result of penetration.

While effective in many cases, some breast cancers are resistant to therapy, metastasize and recur, leading to eventual death. Higher percentages of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) may contribute to the increased aggressiveness, chemoresistance, and worse outcomes among breast cancer. This may be particularly true in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) which have higher percentages of CSCs and are associated with worse outcomes. In recent years, increasing numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as playing an important role in breast cancer progression and some of these have been specifically associated within the CSC populations of breast cancers. LncRNAs are non-protein-coding transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides which can have critical functions in gene expression regulation. The preclinical evidence regarding lncRNA antagonists for the treatment of cancer is promising and therefore, presents a potential novel approach for treating breast cancer and targeting therapy-resistant CSCs within these tumors. Herein, we summarize the lncRNAs that have been identified as functionally relevant in breast CSCs. Furthermore, our review of the literature and analysis of patient datasets has revealed that many of these breast CSC-associated lncRNAs are also enriched in TNBC. Together, this suggests that these lncRNAs may be playing a particularly important role in TNBC. Thus, certain breast cancer-promoting/CSC-associated lncRNAs could be targeted in the treatment of TNBCs and the CSCs within these tumors should be susceptible to anti-lncRNA therapy.",2020-03-20,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9030763,763,763,9,3,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012389413,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9030763,journal-article,3012389413

As the number of bariatric surgeries continues to grow, the need for consensus guidelines for optimal perioperative care is imperative. In colorectal surgery, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols were created for this purpose. The objective of this review is to develop evidence-based ERAS guidelines for bariatric surgery. A literature search of the MEDLINE database was performed using ERAS-specific search terms. Recently published articles with a focus on randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE assessment system. Canadian bariatric surgeons from six provinces and ten bariatric centers performed a review of the evidence surrounding ERAS in bariatric surgery and created consensus guidelines for 14 essential ERAS elements. Our main recommendations were (1) to encourage participation in a presurgical weight loss program; (2) to abstain from tobacco and excessive alcohol; (3) low-calorie liquid diet for at least 2 weeks prior to surgery; (4) to avoid preanesthetic anxiolytics and long-acting opioids; (5) unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin prior to surgery; (6) antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin ± metronidazole; (7) reduced opioids during surgery; (8) surgeon preference regarding intraoperative leak testing; (9) nasogastric intubation needed only for Veress access; (10) to avoid abdominal drains and urinary catheters; (11) to prevent ileus by discontinuing intravenous fluids early; (12) postoperative analgesia with acetaminophen, short-term NSAIDS, and minimal opioids; (13) to resume full fluid diet on first postoperative day; (14) early telephone follow-up with full clinic follow-up at 3–4 weeks. The purpose of addressing these ERAS elements is to develop guidelines that can be implemented and practiced clinically.

Empirical studies of equity in healthcare utilisation primarily rely on the horizontal inequity (HI) approach which measures unequal utilisation of healthcare services by socioeconomic status (SES) for equal medical need. The HI method examines, quantifies, and explains inequity which is based on regression analysis, the concentration index, and the decomposition technique. However, this method is not beyond limitations and criticisms, and it has been subject to several methodological challenges in the past decade. This review presents a summary of the recent developments and debates on various methodological issues and their implications on the assessment of HI in healthcare utilisation. We discuss the key disputes centred on measurement scale of healthcare variables as well as the evolution of the decomposition technique. We also highlight the issues about the choice of variables as the indicator of SES in measuring inequity. This follows a discussion on the application of the longitudinal method and use of administrative data to quantify inequity.

Ship performance in ice is a cross-scale problem, where the desired output such as ship speed lies in larger scale while the actual ship-ice interaction happens in smaller scale. Due to insufficient knowledge in ice mechanics and the demand for computational efficiency, existing approaches for modelling ship-ice interaction from ship performance perspective are mostly either (semi-) empirical, or simplified analytical, with reduced dimensions and extensively simplified mechanics. This paper presents a novel approach to model ship-ice interaction, which maintains the accuracy of the modelling with Finite Element Method (FEM) in ship-ice interaction scale, while being computationally very cheap, therefore is capable to be applied in ship scale simulations. The ice failure is firstly qualitatively investigated through full-scale and model-scale observations, as well as a numerical simulation with Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The model is then simplified and executed by Abaqus to automatically run a large database. A neural network is used to fit the results to get a simulation-free tool for ship-ice interaction calculation. Finally, the uncertainty in the results due to an important assumption is quantified. The results show that the obtained neural network fits the database with excellent performance.

In frustration, some authors advocate alternatives to standard definitions. These include using a list of characteristic features, focusing on life’s effects, or categorizing biospheres rather than life itself; treating life as a fuzzy category, a process or a cluster of contingent properties; or advocating a ‘wait-and-see’ approach until other examples of life are created or discovered. But these skeptical, operational, and pluralistic approaches have intensified the debate, rather than settled it. Given the failure of even these approaches, we advocate a new strategy. In this paper, we reverse the usual line of reasoning and argue that the “life problem” arises from thinking incorrectly about the nature of life. Scientists most often conceptualize life as a class or kind, with earthly life as a single instance of it. Instead, we advocate thinking about Earth’s Life (with a capital ‘L’) as an individual, in the way that species are now thought to be. In this view, Life is a monophyletic clade that originated with a last universal common ancestor, and includes all its descendants. We can continue to use the category ‘life’ (lower case ‘l’) pragmatically to refer to similarities between various phenomena and Life. But the relevant similarities are a matter of interest and preference, not a matter of fact. The search for other life in the Universe, then, is merely a search for entities that resemble parts of Life in whatever sense astrobiologists find most appealing (e.g. metabolism, evolution, information, etc.). This does not mean that the search for evolved complexity elsewhere in the universe or its creation in the lab are futile endeavors, but that debates over whether they count as ‘life’ are. Ironically, finally abandoning the concept ‘life’ may make our searches for evolved complexity more fruitful. We explain why.",2020-07-01,Synthese,https://openalex.org/V255146,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1852-2,2975,2989,197,7,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2828910774,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1852-2,journal-article,2828910774

Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. METHODS Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3 years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5 years. RESULTS Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score < 20) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD. Investigating individual skill areas (e.g., fine motor and nonverbal problem-solving skills), rather than broader indices of developmental level (e.g., nonverbal IQ) may provide important cues to understanding longer-term language outcomes that can be targeted in early intervention.",2020-07-01,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V177929781,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,826,835,61,7,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969389783,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,journal-article,2969389783

In recent years, utility DSM institutions have been challenged to consider the implications of low-carbon transitions and the wider benefits of energy efficiency. In this perspectives paper we trace the historical evolution from utility DSM frameworks primarily focused on economic efficiency objectives towards consideration of the larger transitions in energy demand required to create a low-carbon society. We highlight the opportunities a low-carbon transition agenda creates to deliver more comprehensive energy efficiency strategies, as well as strengths of the utility DSM framework that new low-carbon institutions might be challenged to emulate.

Whether HIIT enhances lower-limb FMD responses and/or augments low flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC) (endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction) responses more than MICT or RT is also unknown. We tested the hypothesis that HIIT would improve BA and popliteal artery (POP) FMD and L-FMC responses more than MICT or RT in healthy older adults. Methods Thirty-eight older adults (age, 6 ± 6 yr) performed 6 wk of either HIIT ( × 2 min bouts alternating between 15-s intervals at 100% of peak power output [PPO] and passive recovery [0% PPO]; n = 12), MICT (3 min at 60% PPO; n = 12), or whole-body RT ( exercises,  × 1 repetitions; n = 14). The L-FMC and FMD were measured before and after training using high-resolution ultrasound and quantified as the percent change in baseline diameter during distal cuff occlusion and after cuff release, respectively. Results Resting BA blood flow and vascular conductance (both, P 0.20). Conclusions HIIT and MICT, but not RT, similarly improved lower-limb vasodilator and vasoconstrictor endothelial function in older adults. Although HIIT and MICT groups enhanced BA vasodilator function, only HIIT improved resting conductance and endothelial sensitivity to low-flow in the BA. In the short-term, HIIT may be most effective at improving peripheral vascular endothelial function in older adults.",2020-05-01,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,https://openalex.org/V14544163,Ovid Technologies (Wolters-Kluwer) - American College of Sports Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002226,1057,1067,52,5,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997961807,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002226,journal-article,2997961807

We examined whether allosteric ligands, can modulate CB1 signaling to reduce pain and inflammation in corneal hyperalgesia. Corneal hyperalgesia was generated by chemical cauterization of cornea in wildtype and CB knockout (CB2−/−) mice. The novel racemic CB1 allosteric ligand GAT211 and its enantiomers GAT228 and GAT229 were examined alone or in combination with the orthosteric CB1 agonist Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC). Pain responses were assessed following capsaicin (1 µM) stimulation of injured corneas at  h post-cauterization. Corneal neutrophil infiltration was also analyzed. GAT228, but not GAT229 or GAT211, reduced pain scores in response to capsaicin stimulation. Combination treatments of 0.5% GAT229 or 1% GAT211 with subthreshold Δ8-THC (0.4%) significantly reduced pain scores following capsaicin stimulation. The anti-nociceptive effects of both GAT229 and GAT228 were blocked with CB1 antagonist AM251, but remained unaffected in CB2−/− mice.

Our understanding of processes underlying oxygen distributions, their key features and variability is often lacking. Here we investigate the magnitude, variability and uncertainty of the air–sea flux of oxygen, carbon dioxide and atmospheric potential oxygen over an annual cycle in the Labrador Sea. We demonstrate that two-thirds of the annual oxygen uptake occurs over only 40 days in winter and is associated with a bubble-mediated component of air–sea gas transfer linked to episodic high winds, strong cooling and deep convective mixing. By neglecting the bubble-mediated flux component, global models may underestimate oxygen and atmospheric potential oxygen uptake in regions of convective deep-water formation by up to an order of magnitude. Uncertainties in wind speed products lead to additional major (up to 80%) uncertainty in air–sea fluxes in these critical regions. Our findings may help explain observation–model discrepancies in distributions of atmospheric potential oxygen and imply that oxygen levels in the deep ocean are more sensitive to climate change than currently thought. Bubble-mediated flux of oxygen into the Labrador Sea surface ocean contributes to air–sea gas exchange, suggest observations from moored profiling and Argo float data.

The identification of reliable predictors of treatment response is instrumental to enact an individualized approach. Alexithymia represents a personality trait reflecting an intrinsic difficulty in recognizing the emotional components of subjective experiences. Thus, its modulating role on treatment outcome has gathered substantial attention during the past years. In the present paper, we aimed at exploring the available evidence for Alexithymia role in influencing the treatment outcome on a wide range of psychiatric conditions by means of a systematic review.We performed a systematic review in Medline and Scopus, augmented by tracking the reference list of the pertinent articles.To be included in this review, research studies had to assess alexithymia impact on a treatment intervention delivered to manage a primary psychiatric disorder.After removing duplicates, titles were screened first, then abstracts, and last full texts were read, eventually leading to the inclusion or exclusion of the papers according to the criteria established before the online search. Then results of the search were downloaded in.xml format and uploaded in Rayyan, a free web software, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability.

Objectives To propose a comprehensive definition of SMM, to create an empirically justified list of SMM types and subtypes, and to use this to examine SMM in Canada. Methods Severe maternal morbidity was defined as a set of heterogeneous maternal conditions known to be associated with severe illness and with prolonged hospitalisation or high case fatality. Candidate SMM types/subtypes were evaluated using information on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebec), 2006-2015. SMM rates for 2012-2016 were quantified as a composite and as SMM types/subtypes. Rate ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with overall and specific SMM types/subtypes were estimated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS >  days) and case fatality. Results There were 2 79 cases of SMM subtypes (among  41 54 deliveries) that were associated with a prolonged LOS or high case fatality. Between 201 and 2016, the composite SMM rate was 16.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.9, 16.3) per 100 deliveries. Severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (514.6 per 100 00 deliveries), and severe postpartum haemorrhage (433.2 per 10 00 deliveries) were the most common SMM types, while case fatality rates among SMM subtypes were highest among women who had cardiac arrest and resuscitation (241.1 per 1000), hepatic failure (147.1 per 1000), dialysis (67.6 per 1000), and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (51.0 per 1000). The PAF for prolonged hospital stay related to SMM was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.3), while the PAF for maternal death associated with SMM was 88.0% (95% CI 74.6, 94.4).

Results After adjustment for potential covariates and the NI, higher total FAs, saturated FAs (SFAs), and butanoic acid intake were associated with a higher degree of frailty. After an additional adjustment for the FI, higher SFA intake (total, hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, and octadecanoic acid) was associated with higher mortality risk, whereas higher polyunsaturated FAs (total and octadecadienoic acid), ω-3 FAs (total, octadecatrienoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid), and eicosenoic acid intake was associated with lower mortality risk. Conclusions Only a higher percentage of SFA intake was associated with both higher frailty and mortality even after considering the degree of nutritional deficits.

Despite limitations in studying the structure and function of the mitochondria, advances in our understanding of this organelle prompted the development of potential treatments for various diseases, from neurodegenerative conditions to muscular dystrophy and cancer. As the powerhouses of the cell, the mitochondria represent the essence of cellular life and as such, a selective advantage for cancer cells. Much of the function of the mitochondria relies on Ca2+ homeostasis and the presence of effective Ca2+ signaling to maintain the balance between mitochondrial function and dysfunction and subsequently, cell survival. Ca2+ regulates the mitochondrial respiration rate which in turn increases ATP synthesis, but too much Ca2+ can also trigger the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway; however, cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and efflux in order to sustain their metabolic demand and ensure their survival. Therefore, targeting the mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling involved in the bioenergetic and apoptotic pathways could serve as potential approaches to treat cancer patients.

An alternative approach is to automate the whole process, accelerating the identification process. Here, we demonstrate an automatic machine-based identification approach for non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a means of increasing taxonomic resolution of biomonitoring data at a minimal cost. Chironomidae were used to build the automatic identifier, as a family of insects that are abundant and ecologically important, yet difficult and time-consuming to accurately identify. The approach was tested with 1 morphologically very similar species from the same genus or subfamilies, comprising 184 specimens from the South Morava river basin, Serbia. Three CNN models were built utilizing either species, genus, or subfamily data. After training the artificial neural network, images that the network had not seen during the training phase achieved an accuracy of 99.5% for species-level identification, while at the genus and subfamily level all images were correctly assigned (100% accuracy). Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualized the mentum, ventromental plates, mandibles, submentum, and postoccipital margin to be morphologically important features for CNN classification. Thus, the CNN approach was a highly accurate solution for chironomid identification of aquatic macroinvertebrates opening a new avenue for implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning methodology in the biomonitoring world.

It has been suggested that, despite their sizable representation at the whole-population level, this demographic is largely avoided by researchers within the neuroimaging community. To date, however, no formal effort has been made to quantify the extent to which adextrals are excluded from neuroimaging-based research. Here, we aimed to address this question in a review of over 1,000 recent articles published in high-impact, peer-reviewed, neuroimaging-focused journals. Specifically, we sought to ascertain whether, and the extent to which adextrals are underrepresented in neuroimaging study samples, and to delineate potential trends in this bias. Handedness data were available for over 30,000 research subjects; only around 3%-4% of these individuals were adextral-considerably less than the 10% benchmark one would expect if neuroimaging samples were truly representative of the general population.

Spinal neurons arise during early embryonic development with the establishment of spatially and molecularly discrete progenitor domains that give rise to distinct, but highly heterogeneous, postmitotic interneuron (IN) populations. Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5–E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae and displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the postmitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable newborn V3 INs to interact with different postmitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the postmitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interneuron (IN) diversity empowers the spinal cord with the computation flexibility required to perform appropriate sensorimotor control. As such, uncovering the developmental logic guiding spinal IN diversity is fundamental to understanding the development of movement. In our current work, through a focus on the cardinal spinal V3 IN population, we investigated the role of neurogenesis timing on IN diversity. We uncovered that V3 INs are organized into early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5–E12.5) neurogenic waves, where late-born V3 INs display increasingly restricted subpopulation fates. Next, to better understand the consequences of V3 neurogenesis timing, we investigated the time-dependent functions of the Sim1 transcription factor, which is expressed in postmitotic V3 INs. Interestingly, Sim1 exclusively regulated the diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs. Thus, our current work indicates neurogenesis timing can modulate the functions of early postmitotic transcription factors and, thus, subpopulation fate specifications.",2020-02-12,The Journal of Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V5555990,Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1518-19.2019,1440,1452,40,7,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994700376,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1518-19.2019,journal-article,2994700376

Efforts in this article seek to improve the position tracking performance of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying network delays, parametric uncertainties, and unknown external disturbances and frictions. Another issue addressed in this article is the common delay-induced phase shift of tracking profiles in many control methods, which is greatly reduced by introducing a novel mixed type of feedback signals in the ANTSM control design. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive control design with two online-estimated compensatory bounds removes the requirement of exact knowledge of network delays and disturbance bounds as a prior. In the master side, a force predictor is used to estimate the current environmental force for the reference signal generator. Therefore, the direct transmission of force signals is avoided. By comparing with the existing model-based and model-free methods, numerical simulation results with six-degree-of-freedom manipulators illustrate the merits of the developed robust and adaptive controllers.

We then study three distinct destabilization mechanisms, as well as a transition from localized spikes to plateau solutions. Two of the instabilities are due to coarsening (spike death) and self-replication (spike birth), and have well-known analogues in other reaction-diffusion systems such as the Schnakenberg model. The third transition is when a single spike becomes unstable and moves to the boundary. This happens when the diffusion of the recovered class, [Formula: see text] becomes sufficiently small. In all cases, the stability thresholds are computed asymptotically and are verified by numerical experiments.

When stimulated, delivery of the intracellular lysosomal membranes is required for the formation of plasmalemmal pseudopods and phagosomes. As a key lysosomal Ca 2+ channel, Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) regulates lysosomal exocytosis and subsequent phagosome biogenesis, thereby promoting phagocytosis of large extracellular particles. Recently, we have suggested that TRPML1-mediated lysosomal exocytosis is essentially dependent on lysosomal big conductance Ca 2+ -activated potassium (BK) channel. Therefore, we predict that lysosomal BK channels regulate large particle phagocytosis. In this study, by using RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and bone marrow-derived macrophages, we show that although BK is dispensable for small particle uptake, loss of BK significantly inhibits the ingestion of large particles whereas activating BK increases the uptake of large particles. BK facilitating effect on large particle ingestion is inhibited by either blocking TRPML1 or suppressing lysosomal exocytosis. Additionally, the increased uptake of large particles by activating TRPML1 is eliminated by inhibiting BK. These data suggest that BK and TRPML1 are functionally coupled to regulate large particle phagocytosis through modulating lysosomal exocytosis.",2020-01-23,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57874-2,,,10,1,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001216457,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57874-2,journal-article,3001216457

Associated with DUI is a frequent modification of the mitochondrial cox2 gene, as well as additional sex-specific mitochondrial genes not involved in oxidative phosphorylation. With the exception of freshwater mussels (for 3 families of the order Unionida), these DUI-associated features have only been shown in few species [within Mytilidae (order Mytilida) and Veneridae (order Venerida)] because of the few complete sex-specific mitogenomes published for these orders. Here, we present the complete sex-specific mtDNAs of two recently-discovered DUI species in two families of the order Venerida, Scrobicularia plana (Semelidae) and Limecola balthica (Tellinidae). These species display the largest differences in genome size between sex-specific mitotypes in DUI species (&gt;10 kb), as well as the highest mtDNA divergences (sometimes reaching &gt;50%). An important in-frame insertion (&gt;3.5 kb) in the male cox2 gene is partly responsible for the differences in genome size.

Unsuspected VTE are often referred as asymptomatic, incidental, or clinically silent/occult VTE. OBJECTIVE To understand the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of uVTE in children. METHODS A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search criteria included controlled vocabulary and keywords for VTE, incidental findings, and children (ages ≤ 21 years). RESULTS Among 10 875 articles, 5 studies (835 children with 75 uVTE) were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, I2 96%; P < .0001. Unsuspected VTE were diagnosed in two settings: first, asymptomatic VTE (aVTE) diagnosed through surveillance imaging for VTE (4 studies; n = 5894; aVTE: 715, pooled frequency: 19%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13%-24%); second, incidental VTE (iVTE) diagnosed during imaging performed for indications without primary suspicion for VTE ( studies; n = 2460; iVTE: 43). The majority (94%) of aVTE were associated with central venous lines (CVL). Non-CVL settings included post-spinal surgery, post-splenectomy, trauma, nephrotic syndrome, and newborns. In general, aVTE were reported to have a benign clinical course, were mostly transient, and resolved without intervention and with few immediate or long-term functional complications. Incidental VTE were primarily detected in children with cancer and ranged from tumor-associated thrombi to pulmonary embolism (PE) with insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions about their management.

A test using crustal thickness and bathymetry data from the East Pacific Rise,"Abstract Recent studies suggest that eustatic sea level fluctuations induced by glacial cycles in the Pleistocene influence mantle-melting and volcanic eruptions at mid-ocean ridges, with models predicting variations in oceanic crustal thickness and seafloor bathymetry linked to sea level change. Analyses of seafloor bathymetry have found evidence of significant spectral energy at frequencies consistent with Milankovic cycles of 1/23, 1/41, and 1/80-1/120 ka−1. However, other studies emphasize the need for crustal thickness observations to test the “sea level hypothesis”. Here we investigate the hypothesis of climate driven periodicity in mid-ocean ridge magmatism through analysis of a unique bathymetry and crustal thickness dataset derived from a 3D multi-channel seismic investigation of the East Pacific Rise from 9°42' to 57′N. Crustal thickness data spans the last ∼23 ka in age and reveals three axis-parallel zones of 200-800 m thicker crust. The amplitude and spacing of these thick crust ridges, which are most prominent on the east flank of the ridge, are consistent with predictions of sea level modulated mantle melting. Similarly spaced ridges are apparent in the longer duration (470 ka) seafloor bathymetry data. Spectral analysis of these datasets shows peaks centered near 1/8 ka−1 and locally near 1/41 ka−1 on the east flank in both bathymetry and crustal thickness. West flank spectral results show intermittent peaks near 1/10 ka−1 and 1/41 ka−1 in crustal thickness and no coherent peak frequencies in bathymetry data. We attribute differences between the east and west flank to the impacts of spatially variable asymmetric spreading and small changes in the locus of accretion. Observed half spreading rates are dominantly faster to the east with small ridge jumps transferring crust from the west flank. Lagged cross-correlations between sea level and crustal thickness indicate a maximum when the latter is lagged by ∼4 ka, which align thick crust zones with the ∼10 ka periods of lower sea level. Crustal thickness is also directly compared with seafloor bathymetry, indicating a component of compensated topography with RMS relief at the seafloor of 10 to 29% of crustal thickness variations. However, complexity inherited from variable asymmetric spreading and seafloor faulting is also apparent, and results provide new insights into how the crustal accretion filter modulates the recording of magma supply variations in the crust and in seafloor relief. While the significance of the statistical analysis of these ridge records is limited by the short duration of the available crustal thickness dataset and effects of asymmetric spreading, the novel observations of crustal thickness varying at timescales of ∼80-100 ka require a mechanism, and the sea level hypothesis provides a plausible explanation.",2020-04-01,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,https://openalex.org/V119230507,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116121,116121,116121,535,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006526059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116121,journal-article,3006526059

Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, most Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This ""flattening of the curve"" has inevitably prompted discussions around reopening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent health care delivery. This document provides a template for cardiac surgical programs to begin to ramp-up the delivery of cardiac surgery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease that is guided by  principles. First, all recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, reprioritizing those with high-risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating. Finally, case volumes should be steadily increased in a mutually agreed upon fashion and must balance the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgery against the overall requirements of the health care system.",2020-07-01,Canadian Journal of Cardiology,https://openalex.org/V126162762,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,1139,1143,36,7,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023945391,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,journal-article,3023945391

Predictions can be sourced from higher-order cognitive processes, such as schemas, but the extent to which schemas can influence pain perception relative to bottom-up sensory inputs and the underlying neural underpinnings of such a phenomenon are unclear. Here, we investigate how threat predictions generated from learning a cognitive schema lead to inaccurate sensory impressions of the pain stimulus. Healthy male and female participants first detected a linear association between cue values and stimulus intensity and rated pain to reflect the linear schema when compared with uncued heat stimuli. The effect of bias on pain ratings was reduced when prediction errors (PEs) increased, but pain perception was only partially updated when measured against stepped increases in PEs. Cognitive, striatal, and sensory regions graded their responses to changes in predicted threat despite the PEs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, corrected). Individuals with more catastrophic thinking about pain and with low mindfulness were significantly more reliant on the schema than on the sensory evidence from the pain stimulus. These behavioral differences mapped to variability in responses of the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Thus, this study demonstrates a significant role of higher-order schemas in pain perception and indicates that pain perception is biased more toward predictions and less toward nociceptive inputs in individuals who report less mindfulness and more fear of pain. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrates that threat predictions generated from cognitive schemas continue to influence pain perception despite increasing prediction errors arising in pain pathways. Individuals first formed a cognitive schema of linearity in the relationship between the cued threat value and the stimulus intensity. Subsequently, the linearity was reduced gradually, and participants partially updated their evaluations of pain in relation to the stepped increases in prediction errors. Individuals who continued to rate pain based more on the predicted threat than on changes in nociceptive inputs reported high pain catastrophizing and less mindful-awareness scores.

A statistical seasonal prediction model was developed for the NIO region tropical cyclone genesis, trajectories and landfalls using the Southern Oscillation index (SOI: as a metric of ENSO) as a predictor. The forecast model utilised kernel density estimation (KDE), a generalised additive model (GAM), Euler integration, and a country mask. TCs from the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre were analysed over the 35-year period from 197 to 2013. KDE was used to model the distribution of cyclone genesis points and the cyclone tracks were estimated using the GAM, with velocities fit as smooth functions of location according to ENSO phase and TC season. The best predictor lead time scales for TC forecast potential were assessed from  to  months. We found that the SOI (as a proxy for ENSO) is a good predictor of TC behaviour 2-months in advance (70% skill). Two hindcast validation methods were applied to assess the reliability of the model. The model was found to be skillful in hindcasting NIO region TC activity for the pre and post monsoon season. The distribution of TC genesis, movement and landfall probabilities over the study period, as well as the hindcast probabilities of TC landfall during ENSO events, matched well against observations over most of the study domain. Overall, we found that the phase of ENSO has the potential to improve NIO region TC seasonal forecast skill by about 15% over climatological persistence.",2020-02-01,Climate Dynamics,https://openalex.org/V93478396,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-05075-7,,,,,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997201642,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-05075-7,journal-article,2997201642

However, the barriers experienced by early career researchers (ECRs) seeking to address these challenges, and the support required to overcome those barriers, are not well understood. This study examines the perspectives of ECRs on opportunities to build interdisciplinary research capacity in marine science. We engaged 23 current and former graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in a policy Delphi method with three rounds of surveying that included semi-structured questionnaires and q-methodology. We identified the following five barriers that limit ECRs’ capacity for interdisciplinary research: (i) demanding workloads; (ii) stress linked to funding, publishing, and employment uncertainty; (iii) limited support for balancing personal and professional commitments; (iv) ineffective supervisory support; and (v) the steep learning curve associated with interdisciplinary research. Our analysis highlights three main types of responses to these barriers adopted by ECRs, including “taking on too much”, “coping effectively”, and “maintaining material wellbeing at any cost”. To overcome these barriers, we propose the following three institutional actions to build early career interdisciplinary researcher capacity: formalize mentorship, create interdisciplinary research groups, and mainstream mental health support.",2020-03-01,Ices Journal of Marine Science,https://openalex.org/V200038611,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsz247,476,485,77,2,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999912383,https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsz247,journal-article,2999912383

For thermal energy, latent heat energy storage systems (LHESSs) offer the potential for significantly improved energy density and quality compared to traditional sensible storage systems. Most materials suitable for use in LHESSs, however, have very low thermal conductivities leading to limited heat transfer rates and requiring advances in heat exchanger design for these systems. Therefore, the first ever experimental study was performed comparing a heat exchanger using bifurcated fins and heat exchangers with straight fins within a shell-and-pipe LHESS. The bifurcated fins transferred less energy than the straight fins during charging tests due to their reduced ability to form convective cells of molten phase change material. During discharge the bifurcated geometry provided a lower but steadier rate of heat transfer, exchanging slightly more energy over an 8-h period than the straight fins. With the additional manufacturing cost required to obtain the bifurcated fins, it was found that their implementation in this shell-and-pipe LHESS offers no energetic nor economic advantages.",2020-06-01,International Journal of Thermal Sciences,https://openalex.org/V128740003,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2020.106331,,,,,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007779737,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2020.106331,journal-article,3007779737

Hebb and the Organization of Behavior: 17 years in the writing,"Abstract The Organization of Behavior has played a significant part in the development of behavioural neuroscience for the last 70 years. This book introduced the concepts of the “Hebb synapse”, the “Hebbian cell assembly” and the “Phase sequence”. The most frequently cited of these is the Hebb synapse, but the cell assembly may be Hebb’s most important contribution. Even after 70 years, Hebb’s theory is still relevant because it is a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the development of neural networks. The Organization of Behavior was Hebb’s 40th publication. His first published papers in 193 were on the innate organization of the visual system and he first used the phrase “the organization of behavior” in 1938. However, Hebb wrote a number of unpublished papers between 1932 and 194 in which he developed the ideas published in The Organization of Behavior . Thus, the concept of the neural organization of behavior was central to Hebb’s thinking from the beginning of his academic career. But his thinking about the organization of behavior in 194 was different from what it was between 1932 and 1937. This paper examines Hebb’s early ideas on the neural basis of behavior and attempts to trace the rather arduous series of steps through which he developed these ideas into the book that was published as The Organization of Behavior . Using the 194 typescript and Hebb’s correspondence we can see a number of changes made in the book before it was published. Finally, a number of issues arising from the book, and the importance of the book today are discussed.",2020-04-06,Molecular Brain,https://openalex.org/V182046277,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00567-8,,,13,1,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014784124,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00567-8,journal-article,3014784124

However, frailty was positively correlated with 4-week titers and was associated with increased odds of being a vaccine responder. For influenza A subtypes, this was mostly limited to HD recipients.Frailty was associated with higher titers and increased antibody responses at 4 weeks after influenza vaccination, which was partially dependent on vaccine dosage.

The paradigms primarily discussed are mothership and drip and ship. Less attention has been focused on the drip-and-drive (DD) paradigm. Our aim was to analyze whether and under what conditions DD would predict the greatest probability of good outcome for patients with suspected ischemic stroke in Northwestern Germany. Methods— Conditional probability models based on the decay curves for endovascular therapy and intravenous thrombolysis were created to determine the best transport paradigm, and results were displayed using map visualizations. Our study area consisted of the federal states of Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Schleswig-Holstein in Northwestern Germany covering an area of 6 06 km 2 with a population of 1 70 56 in 201 (198 persons per km 2 ). In several scenarios, the catchment area, that is, the region that would result in the greatest probability of good outcomes, was calculated for each of the mothership, drip-and-ship, and the DD paradigms. Several different treatment time parameters were varied including onset-to-first-medical-response time, ambulance-on-scene time, door-to-needle time at primary stroke center, needle-to-door time, door-to-needle time at comprehensive stroke center, door-to-groin-puncture time, needle-to-interventionalist-leave time, and interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time. Results— The mothership paradigm had the largest catchment area; however, the DD catchment area was larger than the drip-and-ship catchment area so long as the needle-to-interventionalist-leave time and the interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time remain &lt;40 minutes each. A slowed workflow in the DD paradigm resulted in a decrease of the DD catchment area to 12 km 2 (2%). Conclusions— Our study suggests the largest catchment area for the mothership paradigm and a larger catchment area of DD paradigm compared with the drip-and-ship paradigm in Northwestern Germany in most scenarios. The existence of different paradigms allows the spread of capacities, shares the cost and hospital income, and gives primary stroke centers the possibility to provide endovascular therapy services 24/7.",2020-01-01,Stroke,https://openalex.org/V62532593,Ovid Technologies Wolters Kluwer -American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027493,275,281,51,1,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985895511,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027493,journal-article,2985895511

It is mainly due to the presence of limited active adsorption sites and low surface area that governs an ineffective adsorption potential of the sand material. Herein, graphitized sand was synthesized to tackle the above limitations using two sugar solution sources: a) brewery effluent (as a low-cost solution) (GS1) and; b) sucrose solution (GS2). GS1 showed 68%, 60%, and 99% higher maximum adsorption constant (qmax) for divalent metal ions: iron, copper, and manganese, respectively as compared to raw sand (RS). Coating of MnO2 over the graphitized sand (GSMs: GS1M and GS2M) further helped in Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) removal (3%-9%) when inoculated with MC-LR-degraders, but was not as effective in removing metals, organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to just graphitized sand (GS1 or GS2). Inoculating G and GSMs (for both sugar sources) not only helped in higher MC-LR removal (10%-15% more) but also enhanced the removal of other water contaminants including metals, organic nitrogen, and carbon. GS1 showed 20% and 50% more MC-LR removal than the sand material when tested at a low and high initial concentration of MC-LR ( µg/L and 5 µg/L).

While fragmentation can occur from natural barriers, it can also be exacerbated by anthropogenic activities such as hydroelectric power plant development. Whatever the source, fragmentation can have significant ecological effects, including disruptions of migratory processes and gene flow among populations. In Chile, the Biobío River basin exhibits a high degree of habitat fragmentation due to the numerous hydroelectric power plants in operation, the number of which is expected to increase following new renewable energy use strategies. Here, we assessed the effects of different kinds of barriers on the genetic structure of the endemic freshwater fish Percilia irwini, knowledge that is critically needed to inform conservation strategies in light of current and anticipated further fragmentation initiatives in the system. We identified eight genetic units throughout the entire Biobío system with high effective sizes. A reduced effective size estimate was, however, observed in a single population located between two impassable barriers. Both natural waterfalls and human-made dams were important drivers of population differentiation in this system; however, dams affect genetic diversity differentially depending on their mode of operation. Evidence of population extirpation was found in two river stretches limited by upstream and downstream dams. Significant gene flow in both directions was found among populations not separated by natural or anthropogenic barriers.

Two principles are often employed to moderate explosion potential. One approach is to increase dust particle size so as to decrease its reactivity. The other involves altering the dust composition by admixture with solid inertants. An essential prerequisite for dust explosions is the formation of airborne dust clouds. Dust dispersibility (i.e., the ease of dispersion of a dust and the tendency of the particulate matter to remain airborne once a dust cloud has been formed) is therefore an important safety characteristic, certainly requiring research attention. This paper presents experimental results using a modified Hartmann tube to determine the effect of admixed solid inertants on particle size distribution of dust clouds. Nine types of combustible dust and two sizes of inert Al2O3 were tested repeatedly five times. Generally, admixing small amounts of micro-sized solid inertants caused relative improvement on the dispersibility of combustible dust, forming a better dispersed cloud, and sometimes resulted in increased ignition sensitivity. However, the addition of agglomerate nano inert particles caused a multilayer coating of combustible particles, causing an increase in the effective surface area at the particle contact points, and thereby increasing cohesion in the powder mixtures. Higher inter-particle forces in turn enhanced the combustible particle agglomeration during dispersion, leading to an increase in effective particle size distribution.",2020-03-01,Chemical Engineering Research & Design,https://openalex.org/V166351637,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2019.12.017,1,11,135,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997127186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2019.12.017,journal-article,2997127186

The demand for remanufactured products highly depends on their price and warranty coverage offered, as these two features are the two most important to customers for signaling value and quality of the remanufactured products. This paper identifies the conditions of the optimal pricing and production strategies for a monopolistic manufacturer under a non-renewing free replacement warranty for a two-period planning horizon. It is shown that the manufacturer’s engagement in the remanufacturing activities depends on the warranty length and the ratio of the production cost to the remanufacturing cost. Numerical experiments provide additional managerial insights and implications by investigating the sensitivity of the optimal solutions to changes in the length of the warranty period offered.",2020-08-01,International Journal of Production Economics,https://openalex.org/V184816971,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.107602,107602,107602,226,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997336425,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.107602,journal-article,2997336425

Recent applications in marine disease modeling demonstrate that physical oceanographic models coupled with biological models of infectious agents can characterize dispersal networks of pathogens in marine ecosystems. Biophysical modeling has been used over the past two decades to model larval dispersion but has only recently been utilized in marine epidemiology.

The study objective was to investigate the release of (IL)-1 family members from primary airway epithelial-cells during differentiation, and how they affect primary airway fibroblast (PAF)-induced inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and collagen I remodeling. The release of IL-1α/β and IL-3 during airway epithelial differentiation was assessed over 20-days using air-liquid interface cultures. The effect of IL- family cytokines on airway fibroblasts grown on collagen-coated well-plates and 3-dimensional collagen gels was assessed by measurement of inflammatory mediators and ECM proteins by ELISA and western blot, as well as collagen fiber formation using non-linear optical microscopy after 24-hours.

Several years ago, we first reported the ability of AEBP1 to exert a positive control over the canonical NF- κ B pathway. Indeed, AEBP1 positively regulates NF- κ B activity via its direct interaction with I κ B α , a key NF- κ B inhibitor. AEBP1 overexpression results in uncontrollable activation of NF- κ B, which may have severe pathogenic outcomes. Recently, the regulatory relationship between AEBP1 and NF- κ B pathway has been of great interest to many researchers primarily due to the implication of NF- κ B signaling in critical cellular processes such as inflammation and cancer. Since constitutive activation of NF- κ B is widely implicated in carcinogenesis, AEBP1 overexpression is associated with tumor development and progression. Recent studies sought to explore the effects of the overexpression of AEBP1, as a potential oncogene, in different types of cancer. In this review, we analyze the effects of AEBP1 overexpression in a variety of malignancies (e.g., breast cancer, glioblastoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and skin cancer), with a specific focus on the AEBP1-mediated control over the canonical NF- κ B pathway. We also underscore the ability of AEBP1 to regulate crucial cancer-related events like cell proliferation and apoptosis in light of other key pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt, sonic hedgehog (Shh), p53, parthanatos (PARP-1), and PTEN).

However, as the usual reporter of psychopathology in children is the parent, reports of early problems in children of parents with mood and psychotic disorders may be biased by the parents' own experience of mental illness and their mental state. Methods Independent observers rated psychopathology using the Test Observation Form in 37 children and youth between the ages of  and 2 (mean = 11.01, s.d . = 4.40) who had a parent with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or no history of mood and psychotic disorders. Results Observed attentional problems were elevated in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (effect sizes ranging between 0.3 and 0.56). Oppositional behavior and language/thought problems showed variable degrees of elevation (effect sizes 0.1 to 0.57) across the three high-risk groups, with the greatest difficulties observed in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. Observed anxiety was increased in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (effect sizes 0.1 and 0.2 respectively) but not in offspring of parents with schizophrenia. Conclusions Our results suggest that externalizing problems and cognitive and language difficulties may represent a general manifestation of familial risk for mood and psychotic disorders, while anxiety may be a specific marker of liability for mood disorders.

We assess its performance against recommended psychometric and clinimetric standards. Methods We used data from the Consortium for Lithium Genetics and a French study of lithium response phenotypes (combined sample >2500) to assess reproducibility, responsiveness, validity, and interpretability of the A scale (assessing change in illness activity), the B scale, and its items (assessing confounders of response) and the previously established response categories derived from the Total Score for the Alda scale. Results The key findings are that the B scale is vulnerable to error measurement. For example, some items contribute little to overall performance of the Alda scale (eg, B2) and that the B scale does not reliably assess a single construct (uncertainty in response). Machine learning models indicate that it may be more useful to employ an algorithm for combining the ratings of individual B items in a sequence that clarifies the noise to signal ratio instead of using a composite score. Conclusions This study highlights three important topics. First, empirical approaches can help determine which aspects of the performance of any scale can be improved. Second, the B scale of the Alda is best applied as a multidimensional index (identifying several independent confounders of the assessment of response). Third, an integrated science approach to precision psychiatry is vital, otherwise phenotypic misclassifications will undermine the reliability and validity of findings from genetics and biomarker studies.",2020-05-01,Bipolar Disorders,https://openalex.org/V58085280,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.12829,255,265,22,3,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970473468,https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.12829,journal-article,2970473468

However, the fishery is also an illustration of the paradox behind the idea of the blue economy, where economic growth and sustainable use of resources are promoted as jointly achievable. We show that a sustainability narrative, in which the idea of fishing within ecological limits is present within government policy, public discourse, and practices, is, however, in contradiction with the realities of accumulation and growth that prevail in the fishery. When measures towards ecological preservation are to be taken, geopolitics of access to the sea and tuna enter the stage and change the position and narrative of the same actors, governments, and industrial actors that promote sustainability. We emphasize the difficult and nearly impossible path of practicing sustainability in the current model of growth-driven tuna fisheries. We argue for the need to repoliticize the practice of sustainability through the questioning of what we see in tuna fisheries: a hegemonic narrative of sustainability and implicit growth, without positive socio-ecological transformations.",2020-01-01,Sustainability Science,https://openalex.org/V135086837,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-019-00751-3,75,89,15,1,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994908556,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-019-00751-3,journal-article,2994908556

In addition, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was adopted to investigate the roles of Phi signals and the underlying heat resistance mechanism. RNA-Seq revealed that Phi orchestrated plant immune responses against heat stress by reprograming global gene expressions. Results from physiological data combined with RNA-Seq suggested that the supply of Phi not only was essential for the better plant performance, but also improved thermotolerance of the plants by alleviating oxidative stress and DNA damage, and improved biosynthesis of osmolytes and defense metabolites when exposed to unfavorable thermal conditions.

In this unprecedented time of a world viral pandemic that is associated with considerable mortality, rheumatologists can anticipate challenges in clinical care. We must counsel patients about the appropriate use of HCQ (CQ is not currently available in Canada) in the management of rheumatic diseases, provide valid scientific information regarding the current evidence for effect in COVID-19 disease, and be poised to provide alternative drug treatment in the event that HCQ may be allocated away from routine rheumatology clinical care to treat seriously ill viral-infected patients.

This paper reviews the concept and process for a holistic approach to planning environmental management in the deep sea based on Strategic Environmental Goals and Objectives. Strategic planning around the environment can establish a vision for the future condition of the ocean floor for which the International Seabed Authority (ISA) can draw on a wealth of precedents and experience. By engaging stakeholders and applying current knowledge of deep ecosystems, the ISA can build meaningful strategic environmental goals and objectives that give guidance to its own operation and those of its contractors. This framework builds understanding of the organization’s aspirations at global, regional and contractor levels. Herein, some examples are suggested, but we focus on the process. To operationalize these goals and objectives, progress must be measurable; thus, targets are set, reports are assessed, and appropriate responses are awarded. Many management tools and actions are applicable for achieving environmental goals. To date, the ISA has considered marine spatial planning largely around the current exploration contract blocks.

EHD drying showed significantly higher drying rate (2–2.7 times) compared to purely convective drying at a comparable airspeed range. The direct effect of electrical drivers (electrostatic field and ion flow) on the drying rate was about 30%, while the main effect was due to the EHD-induced convective airflow.

The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between comorbid anxiety disorders, childhood maltreatment and severity of BPD.388 BPD outpatients were assessed for lifetime anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment. Severity of BPD was measured by the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, history of suicide attempts, hospitalizations, psychotic symptoms, comorbid substance use disorder, other comorbid disorders, level of depression, hopelessness, impulsivity and trait anger. We used logistic regressions to test the association between childhood maltreatment and anxiety disorders and the effect of those factors on severity indicators RESULTS: More than half of the participants suffered from two or more anxiety disorders. The most common comorbidity was social phobia. Childhood maltreatment was associated with an increased number of anxiety disorders. Both anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment had, independently from one another, an effect on severity indicators. Anxiety disorders were significantly associated with the number of DSM-IV BPD criteria, suicide attempts and psychotic symptoms. Anxiety disorders had an impact on the level of depression and hopelessness, whereas childhood maltreatment impacted impulsivity and anger trait.Our results show the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders in BPD, as well as their impact on severity.

Sometimes leading to anoxic events, a better understanding of its growth dynamics is necessary to develop mitigation strategies and inform policies on nutrient runoff management. The development of a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for the sea lettuce, Ulva lactuca, provides a generic mechanistic description of energy and matter fluxes within the macroalgae and between macroalgae and the environment. Forcing variables consist of seawater temperature, light intensity, and seawater concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen. The model includes a self-shading module for light reduction under heavy biomass and simulation outputs consist of (but are not limited to) total algae biomass, nutrient uptake (carbon and nitrogen), photosynthetic rate, and state of nutrient reserve. Model parameters were estimated using data-sets from the literature and laboratory experiments, then validated using an independent field study in two estuaries with contrasting nutrient loads that feed into Malpeque Bay, PEI (Canada). The validation step yielded accurate temporal predictions of sea lettuce biomass in both of these estuaries. These results indicate that the present mechanistic modelling approach for predicting sea lettuce dynamics captures salient patterns along a spectrum of nutrient loading and could therefore be of use for managing across diverse ecological conditions, which is particularly relevant for a widespread species like Ulva lactuca.",2020-02-15,Ecological Modelling,https://openalex.org/V88315673,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108922,108922,108922,418,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000465785,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108922,journal-article,3000465785

Yet most analytic methods make inferences mainly from either phenotypic data or genetic data alone. A small number of models have been developed to infer correlations between the rate of molecular evolution and changes in a discrete or continuous life history trait. But such correlations are not necessarily evidence of adaptation. Here, we present a novel approach called the phenotype–genotype branch-site model (PG-BSM) designed to detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with discrete-state phenotype evolution. An episode of adaptation is inferred under standard codon substitution models when there is evidence of positive selection in the form of an elevation in the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio $\omega$ to a value $\omega &amp;gt; 1$. As it is becoming increasingly clear that $\omega &amp;gt; 1$ can occur without adaptation, the PG-BSM was formulated to infer an instance of adaptive evolution without appealing to evidence of positive selection. The null model makes use of a covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (i.e., random changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific mechanisms of molecular adaptation. These include 1) a persistent increase/decrease in $\omega$ at a site following a change in phenotype (the pattern) consistent with an increase/decrease in the functional importance of the site (the mechanism); and 2) a transient increase in $\omega$ at a site along a branch over which the phenotype changed (the pattern) consistent with a change in the site’s optimal amino acid (the mechanism). Rejection of the null is followed by post hoc analyses to identify sites with strongest evidence for adaptation in association with changes in the phenotype as well as the most likely evolutionary history of the phenotype. Simulation studies based on a novel method for generating mechanistically realistic signatures of molecular adaptation show that the PG-BSM has good statistical properties. Analyses of real alignments show that site patterns identified post hoc are consistent with the specific mechanisms of adaptation included in the alternate model. Further simulation studies show that the covarion-like component of the PG-BSM plays a crucial role in mitigating recently discovered statistical pathologies associated with confounding by accounting for heterotachy-by-any-cause.

This hypothesis, in its current version, states that genes with high connectivity (more functional connections to other genes) are likely to be resistant to being horizontally transferred. We defend four claims. (1) There is an important distinction between two different ways in which a gene family can persist: vertically and horizontally. There is a trade-off between these two modes of persistence, such that a gene better at achieving one will be worse at achieving the other. (2) At least some genes are likely to experience selection favoring increased transferability. One consequence of this can be encapsulated as the “simplicity hypothesis”: horizontally persisting genes will experience selection favoring reduced connectivity. (3) In order to make sense of the simplicity hypothesis, we need to consider evolutionary populations that transcend species boundaries. Vertical and horizontal persistence are therefore not two competing ways of succeeding at the same game, but involve playing two different games altogether. (4) The complexity hypothesis can be understood in terms of two related notions: entrenchment and Cuvierian functionalism. This framing reveals previously unrecognized and philosophically interesting connections between reasoning about deep conservation and horizontal transfer.",2020-02-01,Biology and Philosophy,https://openalex.org/V75346102,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-019-9727-6,,,35,1,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991284962,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-019-9727-6,journal-article,2991284962

We studied ER/PR expression in LGSC tumors and cell lines to evaluate patient outcomes and cellular treatment responses.LGSC tumors and patient-derived cell lines were studied from patients with advanced-stage (III/IV) disease. Tumor samples and clinical data were obtained from the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource (COEUR-tissue microarray) and the Ovarian Cancer Research (OvCaRe) tissue bank. ER/PR expression was assessed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Two different IHC scoring systems (simple and Allred) were used. Cox regression was used to identify factors (age, disease residuum, ER/PR status, etc.) associated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Estradiol and tamoxifen proliferation and viability experiments were performed in LGSC cell lines.In 5 LGSC cases studied, median follow-up was 5 months (range 1-227). Fifty-three (96%) cases strongly expressed ER whereas 3 (67%) expressed PR. Cox-regression analysis showed that residuum (p < 0.001) was significantly associated with PFS, whereas both ER Allred score (p = 0.005) and residuum (p = 0.004) were significant for OS. None of the LGSC cell lines expressed PR. Loss of PR and ER expression over time was detected in LGSC tumors and cell lines respectively.

This assumption increases the risk of erroneous conclusions in assessing marine zoning, and consequently counter-productive management actions. Accordingly, it is important to understand how fishers respond to a combination of the implementation of no-take zones, and various climatic and human drivers of change. Those adaptive responses could influence the interpretation of assessment of no-take zone effectiveness, yet few studies have examined these aspects. Indeed, such analysis is often unfeasible in developing countries, due to the dominance of data-poor fisheries, which precludes full examination of the social-ecological outcomes of MPAs. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), however, the availability of long-term spatially explicit fishery monitoring data (1997-2011) for the spiny lobster fishery allows such an analysis. Accordingly, we evaluated how the spatiotemporal allocation of fishing effort in this multiple-use MPA was affected by the interaction of diverse climatic and human drivers, before and after implementation of no-take zones. Geographic information system modelling techniques were used in combination with boosted regression models to identify how these drivers influenced fishers' behavior. Our results show that the boom-and-bust exploitation of the sea cucumber fishery and the global financial crisis 2007-09, rather than no-take zone implementation, were the most important drivers affecting the distribution of fishing effort across the archipelago. Both drivers triggered substantial macro-scale changes in fishing effort dynamics, which in turn altered the micro-scale dynamics of fishing patterns. Fishers' adaptive responses were identified, and their management implications analyzed. This leads to recommendations for more effective marine and fishery management in the Galapagos, based on improved assessment of the effectiveness of no-take zones.",2020-01-23,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228094,e0228094,e0228094,15,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002164542,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228094,journal-article,3002164542

We changed the conductances of simulated dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal neurons according to our measurements to derive a numerical simulation for BD neurons. <h3>Results</h3> The computationally simulated BD dentate gyrus neurons had a hyperexcitability phenotype similar to the experimental results. Only the simulated BD CA3 neurons derived from lithium responder patients were hyperexcitable. Interestingly, our computational model captured a physiological instability intrinsic to hippocampal neurons that were derived from nonresponder patients that we also observed when re-examining our experimental results. This instability was caused by a drastic reduction in the sodium current, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude of several potassium currents. These baseline alterations caused nonresponder BD hippocampal neurons to drastically shift their excitability with small changes to their sodium currents, alternating between hyperexcitable and hypoexcitable states. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our computational model of BD hippocampal neurons that was based on our measurements reproduced the experimental phenotypes of hyperexcitability and physiological instability. We hypothesize that the physiological instability phenotype strongly contributes to affective lability in patients with BD.",2020-07-15,Biological Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V205482884,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.01.020,150,158,88,2,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005098841,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.01.020,journal-article,3005098841

Patient attendees were highly satisfied. Self-efficacy, bother, and use of management strategies were interrelated. Lower bother was associated with increased self-efficacy and more use of management strategies, and increased bother was associated with lower self-efficacy and less use of management strategies. Based on pre–post scores, improvements in patients’ self-efficacy to manage ADT side effects were also observed. Results demonstrate that this brief educational program is feasible and acceptable to patients and cancer care institutions.

However, it is unclear whether there is a linear or nonlinear relationship between risk and industrial development. Perhaps, it is case dependent. Some industrial endeavours such as offshore development, activities in a harsher environment, or development requiring new technologies (untested and untrusted technologies) may pose a higher risk (nonlinear) than more conventional industrial development activities (e.g., petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, pipeline transportation, and the like). Public perception plays a critical role in defining the risk versus development relationship. The public perception of risk is dependent on awareness and understanding of potential hazards and their likelihood of occurrence, and most importantly, effective communication of these along with the associated uncertainty. Public awareness can have a profound effect on the development of public policy, which in many cases is driven more by perception rather than by sound science. This paper sheds light on this crucial issue. It investigates two commonly used concepts of policy and decision-making, the Precautionary Principle (PP) and As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The paper provides a clearer understanding of both approaches with an illustrative example. It proposes a process to help readers understand where and when PP versus ALARP would be most applicable.

We demonstrate how pharmacoepidemiologists, in particular, may use altmetrics to understand scholarly impact and knowledge translation by providing a case study of a drug-safety study conducted by the Canadian Network of Observational Drug Effect Studies. Results A common approach to measuring research impact is the use of citation-based metrics, such as an article's citation count or a journal's impact factor. Alternative metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly supported as a complementary measure of research uptake in the age of social media. Altmetrics are nontraditional indicators that capture a diverse set of traceable, online research-related artifacts including peer-reviewed publications and other research outputs (software, datasets, blogs, videos, posters, policy documents, presentations, social media posts, wiki entries, etc). Conclusion Compared with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetrics take a more holistic view of research impact, attempting to capture the activity and engagement of both scholarly and nonscholarly communities. Despite the limited theoretical underpinnings, possible commercial influence, potential for gaming and manipulation, and numerous data quality-related issues, altmetrics are promising as a supplement to more traditional citation-based metrics because they can ingest and process a larger set of data points related to the flow and reach of scholarly communication from an expanded pool of stakeholders.

Using data from a nationwide inception cohort and strict methods to control bias, the aim of our study was to estimate the real-world effectiveness of simple JIA treatment strategies recommended in current guidelines.Children with JIA who were recruited at 1 Canadian centers from 200 to 201 were followed for up to  years. For each child, all observed treatment changes over time were assessed by independent physicians using prospectively collected data and published response criteria. Success was defined as attainment of inactive disease or maintenance of this state when stepping down treatment; minimally active disease was deemed acceptable for children with polyarticular JIA. Success rates were calculated for treatments tried ≥25 times, and logistic regression analysis identified features associated with success.A total of 4,429 treatment episodes were observed in 1,352 children. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) monotherapy was attempted 69 times, mostly as initial treatment when <5 joints were involved, with a 54.4% success rate (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 50.3-58.6). NSAIDs plus joint injections had a 64.7% success rate (95% CI 59.8-69.7). Adding methotrexate to NSAIDs and/or joint injections (attempted 56 times) had a 60.5% success rate (95% CI 55.7-65.3). In adjusted analyses, each additional active joint reduced chances of success for treatment with NSAIDs (odds ratio [OR] 0.9 [95% CI 0.85-0.94]) and for methotrexate combinations (OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.94-0.99]). Each additional year after disease onset reduced chances of success for treatment with methotrexate combinations (OR 0.8 [95% CI 0.72-0.95]).These real-world effectiveness estimates show that conventional nonbiologic treatment strategies that are recommended in current guidelines are effective in achieving treatment targets in many children with JIA.",2020-07-01,Arthritis Care and Research,https://openalex.org/V13698240,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.23922,897,906,72,7,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2944692451,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.23922,journal-article,2944692451

Recent studies have highlighted an offshore branch of the EARS in the western Indian Ocean, where the Kerimbas Graben and the Davie Ridge represent its sea floor expression. To date, a clear picture of the impact and timing of this EARS offshore branch on the continental margin of the western Indian Ocean, and associated sediment dispersal pathways, is still missing. This study presents new evidence for four giant canyons along the northern portion of the Davie Ridge offshore Tanzania. Seismic and multibeam bathymetric data highlight that the southernmost three canyons are now inactive, supra‐elevated relative to the adjacent sea floor of the Kerimbas Graben and disconnected from the modern slope systems offshore the Rovuma and Rufiji River deltas. Regional correlation of dated seismic horizons, integrated with well data and sediment samples, proves that the tectonic activity driving the uplift of the Davie Ridge in this area has started during the middle‐upper Miocene and is still ongoing, as suggested by the presence of fault escarpments at the sea floor and by the location and magnitude of recent earthquakes. Our findings contribute to placing the Kerimbas Graben and the Davie Ridge offshore Tanzania in the regional geodynamic context of the western Indian Ocean and show how the tectonics of the offshore branch of the EARS modified the physiography of the margin, re‐routing the deep‐water drainage network since the middle Miocene. Future studies are needed to understand the influence of changing sea floor topography on the western Indian Ocean circulation and to evaluate the potential of the EARS offshore tectonics in generating tsunamigenic events., This study presents the discovery of four giant canyons along the northern portion of the Davie Ridge (western Indian Ocean). Three canyons are now inactive, supra‐elevated relative to the adjacent sea floor and disconnected from the modern slope systems offshore the Rovuma and Rufiji River deltas.

At least one paired δ13Ccarb-TOC decoupling event is noted in the Late Bathonian–Early Callovian. Provokingly, we suggest that this decoupling event and other carbon isotopic events in the Bathonian–Callovian resulted from the addition and removal of carbon from the oceanic organic carbon (OOC) reservoir, likely dominated by dissolved and fine particulate oceanic organic carbon. The decoupling event is characterised by a mainly invariant δ13CTOC record and increasingly more positive δ13Ccarb values. The δ13Ccarb-TOC decoupling is tentatively explained by the expansion of the OOC reservoir, which increased the residence time of carbon in the oceans and buffered (slow equilibrium) δ13COOC (approximated by δ13CTOC) to changes in δ13C of oceanic inorganic carbon, comprised mainly of dissolved inorganic carbon (approximated by δ13Ccarb). Reconversion of OOC to CO2 may have resulted in negative δ13C excursions and increased atmospheric pCO2, whereas the change from accumulation of OOC to export of organic carbon to sediments may have resulted in positive δ13C excursions and widespread accumulation of organic matter. It is speculated that other small-scale (~ 1‰) δ13C excursions in the Mesozoic record may have resulted from similar episodes of OOC accumulation and oxidation. Our study calls attention to the potential of the OOC reservoir to act as a critical driver for planetary-scale changes over short geological time intervals.",2020-01-01,Global and Planetary Change,https://openalex.org/V63048404,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.103058,103058,103058,184,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981789710,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.103058,journal-article,2981789710

Both NPRI and TRI focus on public opinion to coerce facilities to reduce quantities of emissions, through market pressure, although early reductions in Canada may be attributed to traditional command-and-control mechanisms. NPRI uses a quantity-based approach to report atmospheric and effluent releases of pollutants to air and water, but does not account for relative toxicity of releases, which could lead to harmful chemicals being overlooked. A toxicity-based approach using characterization factors from the USEtox® environmental impact assessment tool was used for this study. Releases of organic and inorganic pollutants to both air and water in Nova Scotia for 2015 were analyzed. Using an ecotoxicity analysis found that the highest priority chemicals identified using the NPRI's quantity-based approach differed markedly from those identified using the toxicity-based approach. Many of the high-priority chemicals identified using toxicity-based analysis are detrimental to ecosystem health and warrant regulatory attention. The Office of the Auditor General of Canada recently suggested that the Canadian federal government needs to improve control risks of toxic substances. Using a toxicity-based approach may help decision makers in the Canadian federal government effectively control risks of toxic substances and help to inform decision makers, regulators, and Canadians about those risks.",2020-01-01,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,https://openalex.org/V87561820,Springer Nature,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773533/,2238,2247,27,2,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990476015,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06933-x,journal-article,2990476015

However, the impact this practice has on soil biota has been little researched, despite the important role soil biota play in soil ecosystem functions such as decomposition and pest control. This study examines how termination management of Gmr can affect soil biota and their population dynamics. Over two trials, Gmr tillage regimes of fall tilled, spring tilled, or no-till were applied to a spring planted Gmr of hairy vetch/oat (HVO) along with a typical regional practice of tilled red clover Gmr within a four-year grain rotation. Soil microbial biomass (SMB), earthworm density, and beetle and spider activity density were assessed up to three years following Gmr termination. SMB was greatest in the spring for no-till and fall tilled HVO Gmr treatments, but the effect was transient, disappearing after two months. Earthworm densities were negatively affected by tillage (88% and 86% less than no-till in Trial 1 and 2, respectively) but densities recovered three years after tillage to that of the no-till treatment. Beetle activity density was largely unaffected by Gmr termination. Spider captures were more numerous in no-till plots compared to spring tilled in one trial. Impacts of Gmr termination on soil organisms vary by taxa and earthworms were the most sensitive, taking two years to recover from tillage.

Ventricular myocytes and myofilaments were isolated from middle-aged (~1 mos) and older (~2 mos) mice. Frailty was assessed with a non-invasive frailty index. Calcium transients declined and slowed with age in both sexes, but contractions were largely unaffected.

The age-adjusted concentration index (C), which captures socio-economic inequality across a continuous spectrum of socio-economic status, was used to measure income and education inequalities in the incidence of lung cancer in men and women.The crude incidence rate for men decreased significantly over time in Canada from 8 to 7 per 100,000 population from 1992 to 2010, respectively. For women, the crude incidence rate increased significantly over time in Canada from 4 to 6 per 100,000 population from 1992 to 2010, respectively. The age-adjusted C indicated a higher concentration of lung cancer incidence among low income and less educated Canadians over the study period. Although income inequality in lung cancer incidence decreased significantly over time for men, education inequality increased significantly for both men and women.Increased occurrence of lung cancer among the poor and less educated populations in Canada remains a challenge in Canada.

This study introduces a cohort-based approach to analyse trip tour behaviors, in order to better understand and model their relationships to socio-demographics, trip attributes, and land use patterns. Specifically, it employs worker population cohorts with homogenous activity patterns to explore differences and similarities in tour frequency, trip chaining, and tour mode choices, all of which are required for travel demand modeling. The paper shows how modeling of these important tour variables may be improved, for integration into an activity-based modeling framework. Using data from the Space–Time Activity Research (STAR) survey for Halifax, Canada, five clusters of workers were identified from their activity travel patterns. These were labeled as extended workers,  to  workers, shorter work-day workers,  to  workers, and  to  workers. The number of home-based tours per day for all clusters were modeled using a Poisson regression model. Trip chaining was then modeled using an Ordered Probit model, and tour mode choice was modeled using a Multinomial logit (MNL) model. Statistical analysis showed that socio-demographic characteristics and tour attributes are significant predictors of travel behavior, consistent with existing literature. Urban form characteristics also have a significant influence on non-workers’ travel behavior and tour complexity.

However, high-temperature (HT) stress seriously affects its aesthetic and commercial value. In this work, we analyzed the effects of exogenous salicylic acid (SA) on seed germination and seedling growth of ornamental pepper under HT stress. The inherent physiological and biochemical basis of the alleviating effect of salicylic acid was further analyzed. The findings revealed SA with 0.01 mM and 0.1 mM was most effective in enhancing thermotolerance in seeds and seedlings, respectively. SA treatment increased the germination rate and germination potential, and reduced the oxidative damage of seeds under HT stress. For seedlings, spraying SA with 0.1 mM significantly alleviated yellow leaves and dwarfing under HT stress. SA could maintain high root vigor, inhibit water loss, and maintain the integrity of cell structure by regulating osmotic substance content under HT. SA-induced thermotolerance development involved in the activation of antioxidant defense system. SA decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the activity of protective enzymes, and the content of non-enzymatic ROS scavengers in plants under HT. The changes of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters showed that SA was beneficial to maintain a high level of photosynthetic capacity of ornamental pepper seedlings under HT stress.

We sought to determine if simple cardiac risk scores are associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease including carotid wall volume (CWV), carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), and silent brain infarction (SBI). Methods and results A total of 759 adults with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) underwent risk factor assessment and a non-contrast enhanced MRI of the carotid arteries and brain using a standardized protocol in a population-based cohort recruited between 201 and 2018. The non-lab-based INTERHEART risk score (IHRS) was calculated in all participants; the Framingham Risk Score was calculated in a subset who provided blood samples (n = 3889). The association between these risk scores and MRI measures of CWV, carotid IPH, and SBI was determined. The mean age of the cohort was 5 (8.9) years, 55% were women. Each 5-point increase (∼1 SD) in the IHRS was associated with a  mm3 increase in CWV, adjusted for sex (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), a 23% increase in IPH [95% confidence interval (CI) 9–38%], and a 32% (95% CI 20–45%) increase in SBI. These associations were consistent for lacunar and non-lacunar brain infarction. The Framingham Risk Score was also significantly associated with CWV, IPH, and SBI. CWV was additive and independent to the risk scores in its association with IPH and SBI.

However, the extent to which tree management is prioritized in cemeteries alongside tasks associated with the burial and commemoration of the deceased is unknown. Given the large differences that exist amongst burial traditions and cemetery management around the world, it seems likely that cemetery tree management will not be uniform across countries. To investigate this, we compared cemetery governance and management in Halifax (Canada) and Malmo (Sweden) to determine which factors influence their cemetery tree populations, with a specific focus on tree planting. An inventory of places in which trees could be planted in cemeteries indicated that a large number of trees could theoretically be planted in both cities’ cemeteries. However, manager interviews and a review of cemetery legislation indicated multiple dimensions of governance that result in the very real prospect that precious few of these plantable spots will actually become occupied by a tree. These dimensions differed between the two cities, with financial constraints and limited knowledge about trees playing a large role in Halifax, while in Malmo, legislation and public opinion influence the extent to which tree planting occurs. As such, the cities require different solutions to promote tree planting in their cemeteries to avoid future canopy loss and ensure the long-term continued provision of current ecosystem benefits and services.",2020-02-01,Landscape and Urban Planning,https://openalex.org/V104597489,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103699,103699,103699,194,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983538930,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103699,journal-article,2983538930

However, the role of the PML protein and PML NBs in specific mechanisms of DNA repair has not been fully characterized. Here, we have directly examined the role of PML in homologous recombination (HR) using I-SceI extrachromosomal and chromosome-based homology-directed repair (HDR) assays, and in HDR by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We determined that PML loss can inhibit HR in an extrachromosomal HDR assay but had less of an effect on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosomal HDR. Overexpression of PML also inhibited both CRISPR HDR and I-SceI-induced HDR using a chromosomal reporter, and in an isoform-specific manner. However, the impact of PML overexpression on the chromosomal HDR reporter was dependent on the intranuclear chromosomal positioning of the reporter. Specifically, HDR at the TAP1 gene locus, which is associated with PML NBs, was reduced compared with a locus not associated with a PML NB; yet, HDR could be reduced at the non-PML NB-associated locus by PML overexpression. Thus, both loss and overexpression of PML isoforms can inhibit HDR, and proximity of a chromosomal break to a PML NB can impact HDR efficiency.",2020-06-01,Biochemistry and Cell Biology,https://openalex.org/V159551863,Canadian Science Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1139/bcb-2019-0115,314,326,98,3,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985621425,https://doi.org/10.1139/bcb-2019-0115,journal-article,2985621425

Here, we investigate these methods under simple and complex phylogenetic models. We show that AIC can give a biased estimate of its intended target, the expected predictive log likelihood (EPLnL) or, equivalently, expected Kullback–Leibler divergence between the estimated model and the true distribution for the data. Reasons for bias include commonly occurring issues such as small edge-lengths or, in mixture models, small weights. The use of partitioned models is another issue that can cause problems with information criteria. We show that for partitioned models, a different BIC correction is required for it to be a valid approximation to a Bayes factor. The commonly used AICc correction is not clearly defined in partitioned models and can actually create a substantial bias when the number of parameters gets large as is the case with larger trees and partitioned models. Bias-corrected cross-validation corrections are shown to provide better approximations to EPLnL than AIC. We also illustrate how EPLnL, the estimation target of AIC, can sometimes favor an incorrect model and give reasons for why selection of incorrectly under-partitioned models might be desirable in partitioned model settings.",2020-02-01,Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V57552105,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz228,549,562,37,2,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987894624,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz228,journal-article,2987894624

Given the diverse locations in which trees currently exist within cities, including public and private property, gardens, parks, and abandoned lots, we discuss the overlooked contribution of cemeteries to the urban forest. Specifically, we discuss the potential to expand the urban forest through planting trees in the cemeteries of Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada). The objectives of our research were to 1) characterize the existing tree populations in Halifax cemeteries, and 2) estimate how many trees could be planted within these cemeteries. Our research indicates that Halifax cemeteries are dominated by non-native species such as Acer platanoides, Tilia cordata, and Ulmus glabra. Smaller trees are mostly limited to small copses comprised of dense regenerating stock, while the majority of area within cemeteries contains only larger and older trees. Limited natural regeneration and planting efforts, combined with the large size of Halifax’s cemetery trees, indicates the likelihood of future canopy losses. However, this study also found over 2000 spots in which trees could be planted in the 27.5 ha of Halifax cemeteries, indicating that their tree populations could be almost doubled.

Regardless of their efficacy, patients must also consider how such experimental treatments might impact their quality-of-life. We argue that clinical trials produce uncertainty through (i) discussions about the efficacy of clinical trials; (ii) the physiological consequences of clinical trial medications; and (iii) the impact clinical trials have on patient's prognostic understanding of their terminal cancer.

The analysis included 14,602 children aged 0–59 months. We used logistic regression models and the Concentration index to assess and quantify wealth- and education-related inequalities in child malnutrition. We found stunting and underweight to be more concentrated among children from poorer households and born to less-educated mothers. Although the poverty level was low in the eastern regions, socioeconomic inequalities were greater in these regions compared to the western regions. The extent of socioeconomic inequality was the highest in Sylhet and Chittagong for stunting and underweight, respectively, while it was the lowest in Khulna. Regression results demonstrated the protective effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on child malnutrition.

Temporally, these picrites erupted just prior to, and coeval with, the initiation of sea-floor spreading in Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay. Petrogenetically, the chemical characteristics of these picrites (MgO = 18–21 wt%; K2O = 0.01–0.20 wt%; 87Sr/86Sri ≈ 0.7030; eNdi ≈ +5.2–8.6; 3He/4He ≤ 49.5RA) are those of D-MORBs that demand derivation only by partial melting of highly incompatible-element depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) at a pressure of ~ 4 GPa, followed by rapid ascent to the surface, but do not necessarily require high temperatures or high degrees of partial melting. Tectonically, these picrites formed near Paleoproterozoic suture zones in the SCLM of thick Paleoproterozoic cratonic terranes during Paleogene rifting between Greenland and North America. Structurally, the picrites are related to the major intersection of a NNW-trending lithospheric thinning under Baffin Bay and the ~E-W-trending thickened lithosphere of the Paleoproterozoic Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt. During the late Mesozoic, ENE extension that thinned the mantle lithosphere and created normal-faulted basins. Elastic finite-element models and present-day studies of crustal extension show that the thicker Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt underwent less thinning and extension than the Baffin Bay lithosphere. These extensional disparities occurred at the orthogonal intersection of pre-existing ~E-W-trending strike-slip faults in the thicker Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt with the incipient spreading under Baffin Bay, and likely resulted in the formation of one or more pull-apart basins. Because the strike-slip faults are ancient suture zones, trans-tension within these suture zones easily reached depths of ~120 km, not only creating adiabatic decompression melting in the SCLM, but also forming an open pathway for the picritic melts to rapidly reach the surface. This purely tectonic model requires no spatially or temporally improbable deep mantle plume for generation of the Paleocene picrites of Davis Strait.",2020-07-01,Earth-Science Reviews,https://openalex.org/V40187045,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.01.012,102770,102770,206,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2911854693,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.01.012,journal-article,2911854693

Pre-clerkship Residency Exploration Program (PREP) was developed by medical students at our institution to provide students with exposure to disciplines like RO with which they may not have had previous exposure, with the goal of helping with career decision making. The purpose of this study was to review how PREP affected self-reported interest in RO. PREP is a 2-week intensive elective developed by students at Dalhousie University that provides exposure to 1 specialties, including RO. PREP includes five components: half day clinical rotations, skills sessions, simulations, specialty-specific workshops, and lunchtime panel discussions. PREP participants completed questionnaires pre- and post-participation to assess career interest and understanding of Radiation Oncology. Forty participants took part in PREP. Thirty-six responded to pre-PREP questionnaires and 3 to the post-PREP questionnaire. Participants reported increasing interest in RO (24 students, 64.8%) and an increase in the understanding of the role and responsibilities of a radiation oncologist such that they felt comfortable making a career decision about RO. In pre-PREP, five (13.8%) participants listed RO as a top  career choice. Post-program, this number increased to nine (25.0%) of the same surveyed participants. PREP has demonstrated early exposure to RO can increase interest in RO as a career choice.

Archaeologists have interpreted these movements as resulting from many factors, however the effects of climate change are often hypothesized as primary drivers that can “push” human groups to leave some regions, or “pull” them to move to others. Here, we examine climate change at the regional scale over the Common Era using Arctic paleoclimate data derived from a wide suite of biological proxies and geochemical tracers. We consider available statistical composites of high resolution (sub-decadal) paleo-temperature reconstructions for the Arctic region, as well as local-scale reconstructions at century or sub-century scale resolution in three focal regions of archaeological significance relevant to population movements: Victoria Island, Foxe Basin/Baffin Island, and the High Arctic (Ellesmere Island/Northwestern Greenland). We emphasize the two most widespread, though variable, climate change events characteristic of this period: the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and Little Ice Age in the second millennium AD; we also evaluate the evidence for the Roman Warm Period and Dark Ages Cold Period in the first millennium AD, as context for later events. We integrate information on the timing and magnitude of these events across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and assess the degree to which they coincide with current understanding of major population movements, with particular emphasis on three migration episodes. First, the expansion of Late Dorset Paleo-Inuit to the Central and High Arctic beginning in the late first millennium AD is plausibly linked to warming temperatures of the MCA. Second, the migration of Thule Inuit from Alaska to the Eastern Arctic beginning ca AD 1250 is not linked to warmer temperatures as previously hypothesized, and is therefore more likely related to social factors in Alaska. Third, the abandonment of northern regions and new settlement of southern regions by Inuit in the mid-second millennium AD is likely linked to a combination of cooling climate and increasing availability of European trade goods. Together, these three case studies indicate that linkages between climate change and migration are complex, variable, and mediated through social and economic factors.",2020-05-30,Quaternary International,https://openalex.org/V68052730,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.06.002,142,154,549,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2951121064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.06.002,journal-article,2951121064

Methods This study included patients ≥65 years of age consulted to internal medicine through the emergency department at a Canadian tertiary care hospital. An internist-geriatrician determined their frailty status using the Clinical Frailty Scale. Inpatient mortality rates and LOS were obtained from a hospital administrative database. Admission glucose (fasting or random) and hemoglobin A1C were performed within  and 92 days of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. Results This study included 40 patients (mean age, 81.4±8.1 years), 79.3% were frail (Clinical Frailty Scale score ≥5) and 35.3% had diabetes. The inpatient mortality rate was 19.7%, and among those who were discharged from the hospital, mean LOS was 23.7±36.5 days. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be frail than patients without diabetes. Diabetes status was not associated with LOS or mortality, but frailty was associated with both outcomes in multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and admission glucose. In patients with diabetes, mean admission glucose decreased with increasing frailty. Conclusions Frailty was more common in patients with diabetes. Frailty, not diabetes, was associated with increased mortality and LOS in multivariate analysis. In patients with diabetes, admission glucose was lower with higher frailty. Frailty should be routinely assessed in all inpatients with diabetes because it is associated with hospital outcomes.",2020-04-01,Canadian Journal of Diabetes,https://openalex.org/V58299877,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjd.2019.07.001,241,245.e1,44,3,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955327041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjd.2019.07.001,journal-article,2955327041

Light emerging from natural water bodies and measured by radiometers contains information about the local type and concentrations of phytoplankton, non-algal particles and colored dissolved organic matter in the underlying waters. An increase in spectral resolution in forthcoming satellite and airborne remote sensing missions is expected to lead to new or improved capabilities for characterizing aquatic ecosystems. Such upcoming missions include NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission; the NASA Surface Biology and Geology designated observable mission; and NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer – Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) airborne missions. In anticipation of these missions, we present an organized dataset of geographically diverse, quality-controlled, high spectral resolution inherent and apparent optical property (IOP–AOP) aquatic data. The data are intended to be of use to increase our understanding of aquatic optical properties, to develop aquatic remote sensing data product algorithms, and to perform calibration and validation activities for forthcoming aquatic-focused imaging spectrometry missions. The dataset is comprised of contributions from several investigators and investigating teams collected over a range of geographic areas and water types, including inland waters, estuaries, and oceans. Specific in situ measurements include remote-sensing reflectance, irradiance reflectance, and coefficients describing particulate absorption, particulate attenuation, non-algal particulate absorption, colored dissolved organic matter absorption, phytoplankton absorption, total absorption, total attenuation, particulate backscattering, and total backscattering.

Most urban research on Canadian cities has, by contrast, focused on the country's largest cities, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, and has found that urban cores are getting richer, less diverse, and undergoing infrastructural improvements. We examine each model by looking at four secondary Atlantic Canadian cities (Halifax, Moncton, St. John's, and Charlottetown) that all faced major economic crisis in the 1990s to see whether these models can explain the sociospatial changes occurring in them.

In the East China Sea, hypoxia (oxygen ≤ 62.5 mmol m−3) is frequently observed off the Changjiang (or Yangtze River) estuary covering up to about 1 00 km2. The Changjiang is a major contributor to hypoxia formation because it discharges large amounts of freshwater and nutrients into the region. However, modeling and observational studies have suggested that intrusions of nutrient-rich oceanic water from the Kuroshio Current also contribute to hypoxia formation. The relative contributions of riverine vs. oceanic nutrient sources to hypoxia have not been estimated before. Here, we combine a three-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model with an element-tracing method to quantify the relative contributions of nitrogen from different riverine and oceanic sources to hypoxia formation during 2008–2013. Our results suggest that the hypoxic region north of 30∘ N is dominated by Changjiang inputs, with its nitrogen loads supporting 7 % of oxygen consumption. South of 30∘ N, oceanic nitrogen sources become more important, supporting 3 % of oxygen consumption during the hypoxic season, but the Changjiang remains the main control on hypoxia formation also in this region. Model scenarios with reduced Changjiang nitrogen loads and reduced open-ocean oxygen levels suggest that nitrogen load reductions can significantly reduce hypoxia in the East China Sea and counteract a potential future decline in oxygen supply from the open ocean into the region.",2020-05-19,Biogeosciences,https://openalex.org/V13442111,,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2701-2020,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970156891,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2701-2020,journal-article,2970156891

Current trends in SSI monitoring use single source administrative databases with data collection points commonly at 30 or 90 days. We hypothesize that SSI rates are being under-reported due to methodological biases.Data from multiple administrative data sets were contrasted and compared to look at the 90-day SSI rates for hip and knee arthroplasty in a single province from 200 to 2015. SSI rates were calculated over time by year, and the differences in infection rates between single and multiple administrative data sets were calculated as an estimate of under reporting rates of SSIs. Days until diagnosis was measured for those diagnosed with an infection within  year.Combining administrative data sets indicates that hospital-based data underestimate SSI rates by 0.44 (P < .0001) of a percentage point over all years, a clinically significant result given the overall infection rate of 2.2% over the period. Less than 50% of hip and knee arthroplasty was recorded as infected by 30 days and approximately 75% of cases were recorded as infected by 90 days.Single source administrative data sets and short follow-up periods underestimate SSI rates.

Calmodulin is a primary regulatory protein of calcium signal transduction that functions throughout all stages. During growth, it mediates autophagy, the cell cycle, folic acid chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and other functions. During mitosis, specific calmodulin-binding proteins translocate to alternative locations. Translocation of at least one cell adhesion protein is calmodulin dependent. When starved, cells undergo calmodulin-dependent chemotaxis to cyclic AMP generating a multicellular pseudoplasmodium. Calmodulin-dependent signalling within the slug sets up a defined pattern and polarity that sets the stage for the final events of morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Transected slugs undergo calmodulin-dependent transdifferentiation to re-establish the disrupted pattern and polarity. Calmodulin function is critical for stalk cell differentiation but also functions in spore formation, events that begin in the pseudoplasmodium. The asexual life cycle restarts with the calmodulin-dependent germination of spores. Specific calmodulin-binding proteins as well as some of their binding partners have been linked to each of these events. The functions of extracellular calmodulin during growth and development are also discussed. This overview brings to the forefront the central role of calmodulin, working through its numerous binding proteins, as a primary downstream regulator of the critical calcium signalling pathways that have been well established in this model eukaryote. This is the first time the function of calmodulin and its target proteins have been documented through the complete life cycle of any eukaryote.",2020-04-01,Biological Reviews,https://openalex.org/V86137544,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12573,472,490,95,2,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991015583,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12573,journal-article,2991015583

The objective of this work is to use computational fluid dynamics to investigate the role of particle diameter on hybrid mixture burning velocity and to develop laminar combustion regime diagrams at different particle diameters. Analysis of the particle heating, devolatilization, and surface reaction timescales demonstrates that combustion is limited by particle heating with the model parameters used. Furthermore, comparison to the premixed gas flame residence timescale (flame thickness divided by burning velocity) shows that a maximum diameter exists above which particle combustion cannot contribute to enhancing hybrid flame propagation. Combustion regime diagrams constructed for 10 μm particles demonstrate coupling between the gas flame and dust combustion throughout the entire concentration range investigated. Combustion regime diagrams constructed for 33 μm particles illustrate that burning velocity enhancement terminates above initial gas equivalence ratios of 0.68 using the current model.",2020-02-15,Powder Technology,https://openalex.org/V122730748,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.11.106,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992414808,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.11.106,journal-article,2992414808

This paper focuses on the study of a special kind of concrete (without stone aggregates) called flax-lime concrete to decrease amount of environmental footprint via the use of a lime-based binder with a waste material of flax fiber production (i.e. flax shives). Nine flax-lime concrete beam specimens (51 mm × 152 mm x 610 mm) with the same mix proportions were prepared. A layer of jute fabric mesh was also placed at the center of the specimens as a reinforcement. The position and number of layers of the fabric mesh were varied to improve the load capacity and deflection under three-point bending. The physical and mechanical properties (namely: density, load-carrying capacity, failure mode, and load-deflection behavior) of the flax-lime concrete specimens were studied.

This work investigates how the thermoelectric properties predicted with the DOS model compare to the other two scattering models, using three analytical electron dispersions (parabolic band in 3D/2D/1D, Kane band in 3D/2D/1D, and ring-shaped quartic band in 2D). Our findings show that the scattering models can lead to significant differences, and can disagree about whether certain band structures can provide benefits. A constant relaxation-time is found to always be optimistic compared to a constant mean-free-path, while the DOS scattering model shows no such clear trend. Notably, the 1D parabolic band and 2D quartic band exhibit the highest power factors with the DOS model, resulting from a rapid decrease in density-of-states, and thus scattering - suggesting a possible strategy for improved thermoelectrics based on engineering band structures with sharp/discontinuous drops in density-of-states. The DOS scattering approximation also suggests that searches for materials with a delta function-like DOS (as a proxy to the transport distribution) or converged bands may yield limited benefits, due to the increase in scattering.

Soil and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) tissue samples were analyzed to determine the macronutrient dynamics associated with residue management methods and fertilizer rate under a dryland winter wheat-fallow rotation. The treatments included: no burn residue incorporation with farmyard manure (FYM) or pea vines, no burn or spring burn with application of N fertilizer (0, 45, and 90 kg ha −1 ), and fall burn wheat residue incorporation. The results revealed no differences on the effect of residue burning on macronutrient concentration over time. After receiving the same treatments for 8 years, the concentrations of soil organic C, total N and S, and extractable Mg, K, P in the 0–10 cm depth significantly increased in FYM plots compared to the rest of the plots. The N fertilization rate of 90 kg ha −1 reduced the accumulations of P, K, and Ca in grain compared to the  and 4 kg N ha −1 applications.

Berberine (BBR) has been previously reported to inhibit hepatoma cell growth, but the main type of cell death elicited by BBR, and whether the alkaloid can inhibit hepatoma cells carrying HCV genomes, is unclear. Herein, we show that BBR treatment induced a biphasic cell death irrespective of the presence of HCV subgenomic replicon RNA, first triggering apoptosis that then progressed to necrosis between 2 and 4 h post-treatment. Furthermore, BBR treatment potentiated the HCV replicon-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibition of which with an antioxidant attenuated the cell death that was elicited by BBR in these cells. Moreover, BBR dampened the autophagic response in HCV RNA-positive or negative hepatoma cells, and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy conversely augmented the BBR-induced cell death. Finally, BBR inhibited the growth of Huh-7 cells that were persistently infected with the full-length genome HCV particles, and concomitant pharmacological inhibition of autophagy potentiated the killing of these cells by BBR. Our findings suggest that combining BBR with the inhibition of autophagy could be an attractive treatment strategy against HCC, irrespective of the presence of the HCV genome.",2020-04-08,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040908,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015644670,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040908,journal-article,3015644670

Biomass gasification has emerged as a promising conversion technology to meet increasing global energy demands. In this study, a thermodynamic model programmed with MATLAB and CANTERA was used to study the effect of equivalence ratio on reaction temperature and producer gas during the decomposition of woody biomass in a downdraft gasifer. The composition of the producer gas was estimated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy for calculation of the equilibrium constants. A Newton–Raphson algorithm was used to find the final equilibrium state. This process began with an initial estimate for temperature of the chemical composition at equilibrium. The results of the modeling were reported based on the variation in the main indicators of the process such as cold gas efficiency and higher heating value Higher heating value. As such, variations in equivalence ratio were calculated for various moisture contents and the temperature of the reactor. Cold gas efficiency and higher heating values were maximized at optimum equivalence ratio 0.31. Gibbs free energy change through the main parts of the reactor was found to be negative and ranged from − 95 to − 280 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of oxidation was also found to be native at around − 250 kJ/mol indicating exothermic exothermic nature of the reactions in oxidation zone. However, the total enthalpy of the system increased with an increase in the temperature directing the system to be more endothermic in reduction zone (105 kJ/mol).

This paper examines the impact of an O2O platform in the cinema industry by developing a general duopoly competition model. We find that after joining an O2O platform, competing cinemas should differentiate themselves less as either of two factors increases: the total market size or the proportion of audience members preferring movie ticketing services through the O2O platform. Based on analytical results from the model, we further develop hypotheses in the context of China's cinema industry, where O2O platforms play a major role in cinemas' total revenue. In order to further define the practical implications of the theoretical analysis, we conduct an empirical study, using real data collected from the Chinese cinema industry to demonstrate the impact of two major factors on service differentiation between cinemas that have joined O2O platforms. To align our empirical research with the Hotelling setting in the analytical model, five pairs of cinemas are selected using the partition clustering approach. We employ panel-data empirical models to test our hypotheses and conduct robustness checks. The findings confirm hypotheses regarding service differentiation in platform-based markets.

Here we model the connectivity of sea lice larvae (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) among salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada, using a coupled biological–physical model. The physical model simulated pathogen dispersal, while the biological component influenced the survival and developmental rates of the sea lice. Model results predicted high temporal variability in connectivity strength among farms, an emergent effect from the interacting parts of the simulation (dispersion versus survival and development). Drivers of temporal variability were disentangled using generalized additive modeling, which revealed the variability was most strongly impacted by the spring freshet, which can act as a natural aid for sea lice control in the Broughton Archipelago.

CR causes the GCD protocol (single- vs. multiple-currents) and electrode history to significantly influence the profile shape and associated figures of merit. Systems that have undergone previous GCD cycling display much shorter charging profiles as CR has already somewhat charged the bulk material in the previous cycles. CR in early GCD cycles can also introduce curvature in the GCD profile. Because of these CR effects, we calculate a full range of the typical GCD-derived figures of merit (capacitance, capacity, energy, coulombic- and energy-efficiencies and Ragone plots) to identify those most strongly impacted by CR and those which are impervious. Generally, the charging data show significant CR-induced variations; the discharging profiles are relatively unaffected by CR. With multiple cycles, the data from the different experimental protocols coalesce. Clearly, researchers must consider CR when designing GCD protocols and evaluating data. Additionally, literature comparisons between GCD data are not possible without an exact description of the experimental protocol and cycle number used to calculate the figures of merit.",2020-01-15,Journal of Power Sources,https://openalex.org/V177147899,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227354,227354,227354,446,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988130722,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227354,journal-article,2988130722

However, these studies have always been completed in isolation, and do not involve standardized procedures for comparisons across multiple mouse models and background strains. New Method We present a standard method for conducting whisker movement and locomotion studies, by carrying out qualitative scoring and quantitative measurement of whisker movements from high-speed video footage of mouse models of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington‘s disease, Parkinson‘s disease, Alzheimer‘s disease, Cerebellar Ataxia, Somatosensory Cortex Development and Ischemic stroke. Results Sex, background strain, source breeder and genotype all affected whisker movements. All mouse models, apart from Parkinson’s disease, revealed differences in whisker movements during locomotion. R6/2 CAG250 Huntington’s disease mice had the strongest behavioural phenotype. Robo3R3−5-CKO and RIM-DKOSert mouse models have abnormal somatosensory cortex development and revealed significant changes in whisker movements during object exploration. Comparison with Existing Method(s) Our results have good agreement with past studies, which indicates the robustness and reliability of measuring whisking. We recommend that differences in whisker movements of mice with motor deficits can be captured in open field arenas, but that mice with impairments to sensory or cognitive functioning should also be filmed investigating objects. Scoring clips qualitatively before tracking will help to structure later analyses. Conclusions Studying whisker movements provides a quantitative measure of sensing, motor control and exploration. However, the effect of background strain, sex and age on whisker movements needs to be better understood.",2020-02-01,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,https://openalex.org/V132751470,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108532,108532,108532,331,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990861905,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108532,journal-article,2990861905

We systematically reviewed the differences in outcomes after lateral nasal osteotomy with peizosurgery and conventional osteotome and quantified the differences through a meta-analysis.Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were selected to search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published before January 201 that detailed differences between piezosurgery and conventional osteotomy. The key search terms included ""rhinoplasty"" and ""piezosurgery."" Only RCTs in English with patients >18 years who underwent lateral osteotomy by percutaneous or internal approaches were included. PRISMA guidelines were followed in data extraction and study inclusion. Two independent reviewers assessed the relevance of the studies. The point of estimate in the meta-analysis was the standardized mean difference and was pooled with the random-effects model. The measured outcomes were ecchymosis, edema, postoperative pain, and duration of surgery.Five RCTs met our criteria and were analyzed in primary subsequent meta-analyses. Piezosurgery demonstrated significantly lower edema (SMD = -0.75; 95% CI, -1.26, -0.24) and ecchymosis scores (SMD = -0.85; 95% CI, -1.49, -0.20) on postoperative days (POD)  or  than conventional surgery. They were also significantly lower with piezosurgery than conventional surgery on POD  (SMD = -0.64; 95% CI, -1.21, -0.06; and SMD = -0.64; 95% CI, -1.14, -0.14, respectively). Two studies that estimated the degree of pain showed that after piezosurgery, patients experienced lesser pain than after conventional surgery. The mean difference was -0.73 (95% CI, -1.06, -0.39).Piezosurgery causes less ecchymosis, edema, and pain than conventional osteotomy, without extending the duration of surgery.

However, rupture-prone plaques are often distinguished by their internal composition rather than degree of luminal narrowing, and conventional imaging techniques might thus fail to detect such culprit lesions. In this feasibility study, we investigate the potential of ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect vulnerable carotid plaques, evaluating group velocity and frequency-dependent phase velocities as novel biomarkers for plaque vulnerability. In total, 2 carotid plaques from 2 patients were scanned by ultrasound SWE and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SWE output was quantified as group velocity and frequency-dependent phase velocities, respectively, with results correlated to intraplaque constituents identified by MRI. Overall, vulnerable lesions graded as American Heart Association (AHA) type VI showed significantly higher group and phase velocity compared to any other AHA type. A selection of correlations with intraplaque components could also be identified with group and phase velocity (lipid-rich necrotic core content, fibrous cap structure, intraplaque hemorrhage), complementing the clinical lesion classification. In conclusion, we demonstrate the ability to detect vulnerable carotid plaques using combined SWE, with group velocity and frequency-dependent phase velocity providing potentially complementary information on plaque characteristics. With such, the method represents a promising non-invasive approach for refined atherosclerotic risk prediction.",2020-01-15,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57317-7,,,10,1,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000130889,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57317-7,journal-article,3000130889

In particular, we show that such a relationship involves two steps: an intra-domain emergence and an inter-domain emergence. Intra-domain emergence, internal to quantum mechanics, results from the fact that the electron density, from which all the other QTAIM’s concepts are defined, arises from the wavefunction as a coarse-grained magnitude.

Electrical storm is most frequently defined as a cluster of ≥3 episodes of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in a 24-h period. This definition has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, but the effect of lesser and greater clustering of arrhythmias has not been described. Among all patients in the Resynchronization in Ambulatory Heart Failure trial, 14,515 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator–detected events with data available were rigorously adjudicated in blinded fashion. Arrhythmia incidence was examined for clustering, defined as 2 or more VA events occurring within 3 months. The prognostic importance of clustering was analyzed by varying the cluster length and number of events used to define a cluster. Mortality rates of groups with clustered arrhythmias were compared to patients with no arrhythmia or with unclustered arrhythmia. The trial included 1,764 patients, among whom 46 patients had two or more VA episodes within 3 months, whereas 40 had unclustered arrhythmias. Compared to patients with no arrhythmia, patients experiencing unclustered VA had increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 1.93; p = 0.011), whereas the risk was even higher in patients with clustered arrhythmia (HR: 2.68; 95% CI: 2.13 to 3.36; p < 0.0001). Mortality risk increased with higher VA burden (number of VAs in a cluster) and shorter cluster length. This was observed in all groups tested, including the cluster with the least VA burden in the longest cluster length tested (2 VA episodes occurring within 3 months) (mortality HR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.9 to 4.17; p < 0.0001). Although clustered arrhythmias terminated with antitachycardia pacing were associated with increased mortality, clusters terminated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks were associated with still higher mortality risk.

To obtain insight into these processes under nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation, we reanalyze published data from continuous cultures of the chlorophyte Selenastrum minutum. Based on mass budgets, we argue that much of the non‐limiting N and P had passed through the organisms and was present as dissolved organic phosphorus or nitrogen (DOP or DON). We construct a model that describes the production of biomass and dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a function of the growth rate. A fit of this model against the chemostat data suggests a high turnover of the non‐limiting N and P: at the highest growth rates, N and P atoms spent on average only about 3 h inside an organism, before they were exuded as DON and DOP, respectively. This DOM exudation can explain the observed trends in the algal stoichiometric ratios as a function of the dilution rate.

NK cells integrate incoming activating and inhibitory signals through an array of germline-encoded receptors to gauge the health of neighbouring cells. The reactive potential of NK cells is influenced by microRNA (miRNA), small non-coding sequences that interfere with mRNA expression. miRNAs are highly conserved between species, and a single miRNA can have hundreds to thousands of targets and influence entire cellular programs. Two miRNA species, miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p are known to be important in controlling NK cell function, but research to best understand the impacts of miRNA species within NK cells has been bottlenecked by a lack of techniques for altering miRNA concentrations efficiently and without off-target effects. Here, we describe a non-viral and straightforward approach for increasing or decreasing expression of miRNA in primary human NK cells.

While surgical removal of the tumor is the mainstay of treatment for patients with locally confined disease, those with metastases face uncertainty when it comes to their treatment. As melanoma is a relatively immunogenic cancer, current guidelines suggest using immunotherapies that can rewire the host immune response to target melanoma tumor cells.

CCMP470, previously assigned as a radial centric diatom, and its bacterial commensal","Abstract Diatoms are an ecologically fundamental and highly diverse group of algae, dominating marine primary production in both open-water and coastal communities. The diatoms include both centric species, which may have radial or polar symmetry, and the pennates, which include raphid and araphid species and arose within the centric lineage. Here, we use combined microscopic and molecular information to reclassify a diatom strain CCMP470, previously annotated as a radial centric species related to Leptocylindrus danicus , as an araphid pennate species in the staurosiroid lineage, within the genus Plagiostriata . CCMP470 shares key ultrastructural features with Plagiostriata taxa, such as the presence of a sternum with parallel striae, and the presence of a highly reduced labiate process on its valve; and this evolutionary position is robustly supported by multigene phylogenetic analysis. We additionally present a draft genome of CCMP470, which is the first genome available for a staurosiroid lineage. 270 Pfams (19%) found in the CCMP470 genome are not known in other diatom genomes, which otherwise does not hold big novelties compared to genomes of non-staurosiroid diatoms. Notably, our DNA library contains the genome of a bacterium within the Rhodobacterales, an alpha-proteobacterial lineage known frequently to associate with algae.

Perforation formation in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) provides an excellent model for studying developmentally regulated PCD. Ca2+ fluxes have previously been identified as important signals for PCD in plants and mammals. The fundamental goal of this project was to determine the influence of Ca2+ on the rate of cell death and perforation formation during leaf development in the lace plant. This was investigated using the application of various known calcium modulators including lanthanum III chloride (LaCl3 ), ruthenium red and calcium ionophore A23187. Detached lace plant leaves at an early stage of development were treated with these modulators in both short- and long-term exposure assays and analysed using live cell imaging. Results from this study indicate that calcium plays a vital role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant as application of the modulators significantly altered the rate of cell death and perforation formation during leaf development. In conclusion, this study exemplifies the suitability of the lace plant for live cell imaging and detached leaf experiments to study cell death and provides insight into the importance of Ca2+ in developmentally regulated PCD in planta.",2020-06-01,Journal of Microscopy,https://openalex.org/V168975578,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.12859,132,144,278,3,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998691483,https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.12859,journal-article,2998691483

Dairy products are important sources of human dietary cholesterol intake. Therefore, monitoring bovine milk cholesterol concentration is important for human health benefit. Genetic selection for improvement of cow milk cholesterol content requires understanding of the genetics of milk cholesterol. For this purpose, we performed analyses of additive and dominance effects of 12 potentially functional SNPs within 4 candidate genes with milk cholesterol content [expressed as mg of cholesterol in 100 g of fat (CHL_fat) or in 100 mg of milk (CHL_milk)]. The additive and dominance effects of SNPs rs38064336 in AGPAT1 (P = 0.04) and rs13435724 in SOAT1 (P = 0.035) genes associated significantly with CHL_fat. Moreover, five (rs10932695 and rs523413537 in DGAT1, rs109376747 in LDLR, rs4278165 in FAM198B and rs10996777 in ACAT2) and four (rs13734738 in RBM19, rs109376747 in LDLR, rs4201694 in PPARG and rs1108621 in SCAP) SNPs were significantly associated with CHL_milk (P < 0.05) based on additive and dominance effect analyses respectively. Rs109326954 and rs523413537 in DGAT1 explained a considerable portion of the phenotypic variance of CHL_milk (7.54 and 6.84% respectively), and might be useful in selection programs for reduced milk cholesterol content. Several significantly associated SNPs were in genes (such as ACAT2 and LDLR) involved in cholesterol metabolism in the liver or cholesterol transport, suggesting multiple mechanisms regulating milk cholesterol content.

The women's health movement began in the 1960s, and criticized both the pharmaceutical industry and the medical establishment. In the 1990s, patient advocacy groups began accepting industry funds; thousands of commercially-funded groups now dominate the advocacy landscape. As pharma funding became normalized, concerns arose regarding a) the lack of transparency and public accountability regarding funding, b) the distortion of groups' agendas, and c) the ability of pharma-funded groups to dominate the discourse and override less well-resourced patient and health advocacy groups. Although industry-funded groups argue that funding allows them to provide useful services, the trade-off in health risks, exorbitant prices and distorted information is far too high.

Artemia cysts contain an abundant amount of ArHsp21, ArHsp22, artemin, and p26, small heat shock proteins which regulate diapause and stress tolerance of this branchiopod crustacean. However, not much is known of the role of molecular chaperone, Hsp70 in this animal. In this study, the immunostimulatory role of Hsp70 in A. franciscana was investigated, work which included examining the function of this protein in embryo development, growth, survival and stress tolerance. Knockdown of Hsp70 was successfully performed by RNA interference (RNAi), with specific Hsp70 dsRNA construct delivered to female broods by microinjection to knockdown the protein in nauplii. The loss of Hsp70 neither affected the growth nor morphology as Artemia nauplii hatched normally and thereafter grew to adult within 28 days, observations similar to the control animals, the latter injected with GFP dsRNA. The survival of nauplii lacking Hsp70 appeared lower upon 28 days culture but the differences were insignificant when comparisons were made with the controls (P > .05). On other aspect, knockdown of Hsp70 reduced approximately 31% survival upon Vibrio campbellii challenge, indicating that Hsp70 assisted in the tolerance of Artemia nauplii during pathogen infection, perhaps through immune stimulation. Initial findings revealed that Hsp70 knockdown did not affect the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO), a crucial immune protein of the shrimp innate immunity.

This study examined baseline gait differences between progression and no progression groups defined at an average of 7-year follow-up using  different outcomes indicative of knee osteoarthritis progression: radiographic medial joint space narrowing and total knee arthroplasty. Of 4 individuals with knee osteoarthritis who underwent baseline gait analysis, 3 progressed and 1 did not progress using the radiographic outcome, while 1 progressed and 3 did not progress using the arthroplasty outcome. Key knee moment and electromyography waveform features were extracted using principal component analysis, and confidence intervals were used to examine between-group differences in these metrics.

In this system, a structural fill cushion is inserted between the raft and the concrete piles (PC) where the cushion transfers the loads from the superstructure to the piles. They showed that UPRF could increase the load-bearing share of the raft relative to that of the concrete piles, which leads to a favourable economic impact. Stone columns (SC) and deep-mixed columns (DMC) have also gained substantial popularity in the last few decades, and have shown pronounced success in substituting concrete pile foundations in numerous projects. This paper is an attempt to explore the viability of using SC and DMC in the UPRF system. Different column parameters such as material, stiffness, spacing, embedment length, configuration and raft thickness may affect the design considerations of UPRF systems. The current study investigates the effect of such parameters on the performance of the UPRF. In addition, two cushion alternatives were also studied: structural fill and EPS Geofoam. 3D finite element models of a 16-storey building on soft clay were used to compare the behaviour of different types of UPRF foundations embedded in different types of soft clays.

CC calculated using FA profiles of diet and triacylglycerols in pollock liver were significantly different for the three diets. To test the robustness of diet estimates to these differences, we used the CC set derived from feeding the diet with the lowest fat concentration, published prey FA profiles and realistic diet estimates of pollock to construct ‘pseudo-predators'. Application of QFASA to each pseudo-predator using the three sets of CC and the same prey FA profiles resulted in diet estimate biases of twofold for major prey items and approximately fivefold for minor prey items.

Laboratory-reared copepodites of the marine calanoid Calanus finmarchicus were used to test the effects of temperature (at 6°C, 12°C and increasing temperature stress) and prey type (the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra and the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii ) on the extent and efficiency of dietary EPA and DHA incorporation from phytoplankton to copepods in a set of feeding experiments using 13 C labelling. Temperature was a significant determinant of C . finmarchicus copepodites' EFA incorporation and gross growth efficiency, defined as the fraction of ingested EFA retained in copepod tissue. Ingestion and incorporation of both EFA were higher at warmer temperature, except in the case of DHA in copepods feeding on diatoms. DHA-associated growth efficiency was higher at the higher temperature for copepodites consuming the dinoflagellate, but temperature-related variation in algal EFA content was also a predictive factor. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that copepodites are capable of synthesizing EPA when consuming an EPA-depleted diet. Our study implies that the copepod link of marine food webs is resilient in terms of EFA transfer when confronted with alterations of ambient temperature and prey type availability.

However, the onset and completion of weaning are critical turning points for individual development and survival, with implications for a species' life history including reproductive potential. δ15N and δ13C deposited in odontocete teeth annuli provide a lifetime record of diet, offering an opportunity to investigate variation and trends in fundamental biology. While available reproductive parameters for beaked whales have largely been inferred from single records of stranded or hunted animals and extrapolated across species, here we examine the weaning strategy and nursing duration in northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) by measuring stable isotopes deposited in dentine growth layer groups (GLGs). Using a collection of H. ampullatus teeth taken from whales killed during the whaling era (N = 48) and from two stranded specimens, we compared ontogenetic variation of δ15N and δ13C found in annual GLGs across all individuals, by sex and by region. We detected age-based trends in both δ15N and δ13C that are consistent across regions and males and females, and indicate that nursing is prolonged and weaning does not conclude until whales are 3-4 years old, substantially later than previous estimates of 1 year. Incorporating a prolonged period of maternal care into H. ampullatus life history significantly reduces their reproductive potential, with broad implications for models of beaked whale life history, energetics and the species' recovery from whaling.",2020-06-23,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235114,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035798931,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235114,journal-article,3035798931

These exudates contribute to aggregates (marine snow) that rapidly transport organic material to the seafloor, potentially capturing contaminants like petroleum components. Ocean acidification (OA) impacts marine organisms, especially those that utilize inorganic carbon for photosynthesis and EPS production. Here we investigated the response of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown to present day and future ocean conditions in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF and OAWAF) of oil and a diluted chemically enhanced WAF (DCEWAF and OADCEWAF). T. pseudonana responded to WAF/DCEWAF but not OA and no multiplicative effect of the two factors (i.e., OA and oil/dispersant) was observed. T. pseudonana released more colloidal EPS (< 0.7 μm to > 3 kDa) in the presence of WAF/DCEWAF/OAWAF/OADCEWAF than in the corresponding Controls. Colloidal EPS and particulate EPS in the oil/dispersant treatments have higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratios than those in the control treatments, and thus are likely stickier and have a greater potential to form aggregates of marine oil snow. More TEP was produced in response to WAF than in Controls; OA did not influence its production. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations and distributions were significantly impacted by the presence of dispersants but not OA. PAHs especially Phenanthrenes, Anthracenes, Chrysenes, Fluorenes, Fluoranthenes, Pyrenes, Dibenzothiophenes and 1-Methylphenanthrene show major variations in the aggregate and surrounding seawater fraction of oil and oil plus dispersant treatments.

Given that some individuals may use aggression to modulate negative emotional states, it was predicted that AS dimensions would mediate relations between attachment anxiety (vs. attachment avoidance) and certain forms of aggression, particularly impulsive aggression. Moreover, it was hypothesized that the relations among attachment, aggression, and AS would be moderated by gender. Participants (N = 1,042) completed measures of attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised [ECR-R]), aggression (Aggression Questionnaire [AQ]; Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scales [IPAS]), and AS (AS Index-3 [ASI-3]). Results indicated that AS mediated relations between attachment dimensions (both anxiety and avoidance) and most forms of aggression, with each of the AS dimensions playing a unique role differentially by gender. Cognitive concerns emerged as a significant mediator, particularly for men; physical and social concerns played more of a mediating role for women.

Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a registered cardiac computed tomogram (CT) rather than an EA map to permit real-time localization and avoid errors introduced by incomplete maps. Methods Before LV VT ablation, 1 patients underwent CT imaging and 3-dimensional reconstruction of the cardiac surface to create a triangle mesh surface, which was registered to the EA map during the procedure and imported into custom localization software. The software uses QRS integrals from leads III, V2, and V6; derives personalized regression coefficients from pacing at ≥5 sites with known locations; and estimates the location of unknown activation sites on the 3-dimensional patient-specific LV endocardial surface. Localization accuracy was quantified for VT exit sites in millimeters by comparing the calculated against the known locations. Results The VT exit site was identified for 20 VTs using activation and entrainment mapping, supplemented by pace-mapping at the scar margin. The automated localization software achieved incremental accuracy with additional pacing sites and had a mean localization error of 6.9 ± 5.7 mm for the 20 VTs.

Assuming that the activator diffuses much slower than the inhibitor, such a system is well-known to admit solutions where the activator concentrates at N “spikes”. In the large- N limit, we derive the effective spike density for an arbitrary μ ( x ) . We show that this density satisfies a first-order separable ODE. As a consequence, we derive instability thresholds for N spikes that correspond to a singularity in the ODE for the density. We recover, as a special case, the well-known stability thresholds for constant μ first derived in Iron et al.

These trials recruited patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction less than 50%. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical in all 3 trials. The primary intervention in these trials included transendocardial stem cell injection of stem cells or placebo via cardiac catheterization. The follow-up period was  year. IIEF data were collected at baseline and at multiple time points in each trial.We investigated erectile function over time based on cell dose, cell source (autologous vs allogenic), cell type (mesenchymal stem cells vs bone marrow mononuclear cells), and comparing men who received SCT with those who received placebo.A total of 3 men were identified with complete IIEF data.  men received placebo injection, and 2 received SCT. The median age was 66.5 years. Comorbidities were similar among all men. Analysis was performed on men with ED, defined by an IIEF-EF score of 2 or less. In the placebo and all-comer SCT group, the median IIEF-EF score was 5 [1-8] and 5 [1-15] at baseline and was 3.5 [3-5.8] and  [1-18] at 1 months (P > .05). When analyzed by cell dose, the IIEF-EF score in men who received 2 million cells increased significantly over 1 months (14 [4-23] to 2 [15-24.5], P = .014.) Similarly, an autologous cell source resulted in a similar increase from baseline to 1 months (14 [3.8-23.3] to 2 [12-22], P = .030).Erectile function may improve after systemic delivery of SCT in men with ischemic cardiomyopathy and at least mild ED.This post hoc analysis is the first to investigate the effect of SCT on erectile function using randomized, placebo-controlled data. Weaknesses include that ED was not a primary end point, and men were not originally recruited based on erectile function.Future trials on systemic delivery of SCT for ED should focus on high cell dose and autologous cell source, as these seem to provide the best response in men with at least mild ED.

Previous research has found plain packaging (a homogenized form of packaging), in comparison to branded packaging, effectively increases attention to GHWs using UK packaging prototypes. Past studies have also found that illness sensitivity (IS) protects against health-impairing behaviors. Building on this evidence, the goal of the current study was to assess the effect of packaging type (plain vs. branded), IS level, and their interaction on attention to GHWs on cigarette packages using proposed Canadian prototypes. Aims and Methods We assessed the dwell time and fixations on the GHW component of 4 cigarette pack stimuli (20 branded; 2 plain). Stimuli were presented in random order to 5 smokers (60.8% male; mean age = 33.1; 92.2% daily smokers) using the EyeLink 100 system. Participants were divided into low IS (n = 25) and high IS (n = 25) groups based on scores on the Illness Sensitivity Index. Results Overall, plain packaging relative to branded packaging increased fixations (but not dwell time) on GHWs. Moreover, low IS (but not high IS) smokers showed more fixations to GHWs on plain versus branded packages. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that plain packaging is a promising intervention for daily smokers, particularly those low in IS, and contribute evidence in support of impending implementation of plain packaging in Canada. Implications Our findings have three important implications. First, our study provides controlled experimental evidence that plain packaging is a promising intervention for daily smokers. Second, the findings of this study contribute supportive evidence for the impending plain packaging policy in Canada, and can therefore aid in defense against anticipated challenges from the tobacco industry upon its implementation. Third, given its effects in increasing attention to GHWs, plain packaging is an intervention likely to provide smokers enhanced incentive for smoking cessation, particularly among those low in IS who may otherwise be less interested in seeking treatment for tobacco dependence.",2020-10-08,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,https://openalex.org/V62426309,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz243,1788,1794,22,10,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999905684,https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz243,journal-article,2999905684

The primary study objective was to quantify the day-to-day reliability of quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius and gluteus medius activation patterns in healthy young adult gait. Secondarily, the reliability of spatiotemporal, and knee/hip motion and moment-based gait outcomes was assessed.20 young adults were recruited and tested on two separate days. Using standardized procedures, participants were prepared for surface electromyography and lower extremity motion capture. All individuals walked on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill while muscle activation, segment motions and ground reaction forces were recorded. Sagittal plane motion and net external sagittal and frontal plane moments were calculated. Discrete biomechanical and muscle activation measures were calculated, and non-negative matrix factorization extracted amplitude and temporal muscle activation features. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, Standard Error of Measurement and Minimum Detectable Change were calculated.High to excellent Intraclass correlation coefficients were found between visits for most primary and secondary outcomes.

The pathologies of this prevalent sensory disorder begin within the ear at synapses of the primary auditory receptors, their postsynaptic partners and their supporting cells. The extent of noise-induced damage, however, is determined by overstimulation of primary auditory receptors, upstream of where the pathologies manifest. A systematic characterization of the electrophysiological function of the upstream primary auditory receptors is warranted to understand how noise exposure impacts on downstream targets, where the pathologies of hearing loss begin. Here, we used the experimentally-accessible locust ear (male, Schistocerca gregaria) to characterize a decrease in the auditory receptor's ability to respond to sound after noise exposure. Surprisingly, after noise exposure, the electrophysiological properties of the auditory receptors remain unchanged, despite a decrease in the ability to transduce sound. This auditory deficit stems from changes in a specialized receptor lymph that bathes the auditory receptors, revealing striking parallels with the mammalian auditory system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Noise exposure is the largest preventable cause of hearing loss. It is the auditory receptors that bear the initial brunt of excessive acoustic stimulation, because they must convert excessive sound-induced movements into electrical signals, but remain functional afterward. Here we use the accessible ear of an invertebrate to, for the first time in any animal, characterize changes in auditory receptors after noise overexposure. We find that their decreased ability to transduce sound into electrical signals is, most probably, due to changes in supporting (scolopale) cells that maintain the ionic composition of the ear. An emerging doctrine in hearing research is that vertebrate primary auditory receptors are surprisingly robust, something that we show rings true for invertebrate ears too.",2020-04-08,The Journal of Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V5555990,Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2279-19.2019,3130,3140,40,15,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009386942,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2279-19.2019,journal-article,3009386942

We sought to determine (1) temperature treatments that could be used to kill immature D. suzukii in fruit or packaging and (2) whether development on different fruits led to differences in cold tolerance of immature D. suzukii . We reared animals from egg on a banana-based laboratory diet and diets made of apple ( Malus domestica Borkhausen; Rosaceae), blueberry ( Vaccinium Linnaeus; Ericaceae), cherry ( Prunus avium Linnaeus; Rosaceae), grape ( Vitis Linnaeus; Vitaceae), orange ( Citrus × sinensis (Linnaeus) Osbeck; Rutaceae), raspberry ( Rubus Linnaeus; Rosaceae), or strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne; Rosaceae) homogenate in agar and measured development time, adult body size, and cold tolerance. Diet type had complex effects on development time; in particular, D. suzukii reared on apple-based or blueberry-based diets developed more slowly to a smaller adult body size than those on other diets. Cold exposure killed eggs and both first and second instars. Survival of 24 hours at +4 °C by feeding third instars was lowest in blueberry and cherry. Five days at +0.6 °C killed all feeding third instars; this treatment is likely sufficient for targeting D. suzukii in fruit.

Management of Varroa destructor, important parasitic mites of honey bees, could be improved through better understanding of the chemical ecology of this host-parasite relationship. We refined techniques of mounting mites to obtain electrophysiological recordings (electrotarsograms) of their responses to synthetic odor stimuli. Results of 27 electrotarsogram recordings from V. destructor revealed responses to 1 odorants relative to solvent controls. Electrotarsogram responses to methyl palmitate, ethyl palmitate, and 2-heptanol were highest at the lowest stimulus loading (10 ng) we tested, suggesting that V. destructor may have acute sensitivity to low concentrations of some odors. Results suggest that odorant origin (e.g., methyl oleate from honey bee larvae, geraniol from adult honey bee alarm pheromone, and α-terpineol, a plant secondary metabolite) can influence the degree of electrophysiological response. Varroa destructor tended to be more responsive to known attractants and repellents relative to previously unexplored odorants and some repellent terpenes.

It has been suggested that IOR affects a process at the output end of processing continuum when it is generated while the oculomotor system is activated. Following the path set by Kavyani, Farsi, Abdoli, and Klein (2017) we used the locus of slack logic embedded in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm to test this idea. We generated what we expected would be the output form of IOR by beginning each with participants making a target directed saccade which was followed by two tasks. Task 1, was a 2-choice auditory discrimination task and Task 2 was a 2-choice visual localization task. We varied the interval between the onsets of the two targets associated with these two tasks (using TTOAs of 200, 400, or 800 msec). As expected the visual task suffered from a robust PRP effect (substantially delayed RTs at the shorter TTOAs). There was also a robust IOR effect with RTs to localize visual targets being slower when the targets were presented at a previously fixated location. Importantly, and in striking to our previous results wherein we generated the input form of IOR, in the present study there was an additive effect between IOR and TTOA on RT2. As implied by the locus of slack logic, we therefore conclude that the form of IOR generated when the oculomotor system is activated affects a late stage of processing. Converging evidence for this conclusion, from a variety of neuroscientific methods, is presented and the dearth of such evidence about the input form of IOR is noted.",2020-01-01,Cortex,https://openalex.org/V116196263,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2018.10.023,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2900399196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2018.10.023,journal-article,2900399196

Glycerol rhizotomy (GR) is a percutaneous lesioning surgery commonly performed for the treatment of medically refractory TN. While treatment for acute pain relief is excellent, long-term pain relief is poorer. The object of this study was to assess the efficacy of percutaneous retrogasserian GR for the treatment of MS-TN versus ITN. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed, identifying 21 patients who had undergone 40 GR procedures from 198 to 201 at a single academic institution. All patients were diagnosed with medically refractory MS-TN (18 procedures) or ITN (21 procedures). The primary outcome measures of interest were immediate pain relief and time to pain recurrence following initial and repeat GR procedures. Secondary outcomes included medication usage and presence of periprocedural hypesthesia. RESULTS The initial pain-free response rate was similar between groups (p = 0.726): MS-TN initial GR 89.6%; MS-TN repeat GR 91.9%; ITN initial GR 89.6%; ITN repeat GR 87.0%. The median time to recurrence after initial GR was similar between MS-TN (2. ± 1.3 years) and ITN (2. ± 0. years) patients (p = 0.87). However, there was a statistically significant difference in the time to recurrence after repeat GR between MS-TN (2. ± 0. years) and ITN patients (1.2 ± 0. years; p &lt; 0.05). The presence of periprocedural hypesthesia was highly predictive of pain-free survival (p &lt; 0.01).

These reactions demonstrate considerable substrate scope, from utilization of small phenyl moieties to large porphyrin rings, with varying lengths and different angles. To control conformational flexibility, amide bonds were introduced between the bridgehead carbon of BCP/cubane and the porphyrin rings. Through varying the orientation of the substituents around the amide bond of cubane/BCP, different intermolecular interactions were identified through single crystal X-ray analysis. These studies revealed non-covalent interactions that are the first-of-their-kind including a unique iodine-oxygen interaction between cubane units.

Although Ni–P electroless coatings are known for their corrosion resistance and anti-wear behaviors, still there is a dire need for increasing the anti-wear and anti-corrosion behaviors to expand potential application of Ni–P coatings in oil and gas and petrochemical sectors. In this work, graphene enrichment in Ni–P coating matrix was performed achieving various compositions of ternary Ni–P-graphene coatings through the addition of various concentrations of graphene (30 mg/L, 60 mg/L and 100 mg/L) into electroless plating bath.

This study examines whether labor employment decisions, a major part of a firm’s operations, help predict accounting improprieties and consequently play a role in audit planning and pricing. We find that negative abnormal employment changes are associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent financial restatements, accounting irregularities, and lawsuits related to accounting fraud, and generally require greater effort from auditors as manifested by higher audit fees and longer audit report lags. Positive abnormal employment changes are associated with subsequent restatements and longer audit report lags, but not associated with fraud or audit fees.

Optimizing medication self-management is important for persons with SCI/D to improve outcomes; however, there is a lack of research on how healthcare/service providers and persons with SCI/D experience medication self-management. Objective To explore attitudes and experiences of medication self-management from the perspectives of persons with SCI/D and providers, and to explore the extent to which the Taxonomy of Everyday Self-management Strategies (TEDSS) framework captured participants’ experiences with medication self-management. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone until data saturation was reached. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative approaches. The TEDSS framework was adapted and applied deductively. Results Fifty-one individuals participated in this study, 3 providers and 1 persons with SCI/D. Disease controlling strategies was the domain discussed in most detail by all participants. In this domain, participants discussed managing medications and treatments, monitoring/managing side effects, and controlling complications. Process strategies (problem-solving, decision-making) and resource strategies (seeking support) were the next most frequently discussed domains. Among all participant groups, there was a lack of detailed discussion of social interactions, health behaviour, and internal strategies. Medication self-management support was not extensively discussed by any group. Conclusion This study highlighted the complex nature of medication self-management. While persons with SCI/D and providers discussed similar components of the TEDSS framework, providers had minimal reflections on the impact of medication self-management on everyday life. This study identified the need for explicit discussions between providers and persons with SCI/D, involving all components of self-management and self-management support in order to improve medication self-management.",2020-12-01,Research in Social & Administrative Pharmacy,https://openalex.org/V50431791,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.01.014,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004182665,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.01.014,journal-article,3004182665

Extensions to the Kalman filter, including the extended and unscented Kalman filters, incorporate linearizations for models where the observation model p(observation|state) is nonlinear. We argue that in many cases, a model for p(state|observation) proves both easier to learn and more accurate for latent state estimation. Approximating p(state|observation) as gaussian leads to a new filtering algorithm, the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF), which can perform well even when p(observation|state) is highly nonlinear and/or nongaussian. The approximation, motivated by the Bernstein–von Mises theorem, improves as the dimensionality of the observations increases. The DKF has computational complexity similar to the Kalman filter, allowing it in some cases to perform much faster than particle filters with similar precision, while better accounting for nonlinear and nongaussian observation models than Kalman-based extensions. When the observation model must be learned from training data prior to filtering, off-the-shelf nonlinear and nonparametric regression techniques can provide a gaussian model for p(observation|state) that cleanly integrates with the DKF. As part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial, we successfully implemented gaussian process regression with the DKF framework in a brain-computer interface to provide real-time, closed-loop cursor control to a person with a complete spinal cord injury. In this letter, we explore the theory underlying the DKF, exhibit some illustrative examples, and outline potential extensions.",2020-04-14,Neural Computation,https://openalex.org/V207023548,MIT Press,https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01275,969,1017,32,5,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011322992,https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01275,journal-article,3011322992

The objective of this scoping review was to systematically examine the literature describing public involvement in initatives to reduce low-value care. Methods Evidence sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from inception to November 26, 2019, grey literature (CADTH Tool), reference lists of included articles, and expert consultation. Citations were screened in duplicate and included if they referred to the public’s perception and/or involvement in reducing low-value care. Public included patients or citizens without any advanced healthcare knowledge. Low-value care included medical tests or treatments that lack efficacy, have risks that exceed benefit, or are not cost-effective. Extracted data pertained to study characteristics, low-value practice, clinical setting, and level of public involvement (i.e., patient-clinician interaction, research, or policy-making). Results The 21 included citations were predominantly original research ( n = 138, 63%), published since 201 ( n = 192, 88%), originating from North America ( n = 146, 67%). Most citations focused on patient engagement within the patient-clinician interaction ( n = 156, 72%), using tools that included shared decision-making ( n = 66, 42%) and patient-targeted educational materials ( n = 72, 46%), and reported both reductions in low-value care and improved patient perceptions regarding low-value care. Fewer citations examined public involvement in low-value care policy-making ( n = 33, 15%). Among citations that examined perspectives regarding public involvement in initiatives to reduce low-value care ( n = 10, 5%), there was consistent support for the utility of tools applied within the patient-clinician interaction and less consistent support for involvement in policy-making. Conclusions Efforts examining public involvement in low-value care concentrate within the patient-clinician interaction, wherein patient-oriented educational materials and shared decision-making tools have been commonly studied and are associated with reductions in low-value care. This contrasts with inclusion of the public in low-value care policy decisions wherein tools to promote engagement are less well-developed and involvement not consistently viewed as valuable.

We performed a multicenter feasibility study to examine our ability to identify and obtain consent from eligible APS patients and to obtain 95% adherence with daily rivaroxaban administration, in order to inform and power a larger study. Clinical outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis were also collected. Methods APS patients with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) were recruited over 2 years (Oct 2014–Sept 2016) and followed for ≥  year. Patients were assessed clinically every  months and had pill counts performed every  months. Numbers of patients fulfilling study criteria, as well as those consenting to participate, were tracked, and percentage adherence based on pill counts was recorded. These data were compared against the feasibility endpoints. Rates of thrombosis and bleeding were calculated. Criterion for feasibility was obtaining consent from 13 of 15 identified APS patients over 2 years. Results Ninety-six eligible patients were identified, and 1 declined participation. Eighty-two patients were followed for a mean of  months, representing 129.8 patient-years. Average rivaroxaban adherence was 95.0%. During follow-up, there were  thromboembolic events (2 cerebrovascular and 2 VTE). There were no episodes of major bleeding. Conclusions Adequately powered comparative trials using patient-important outcomes in APS are unlikely to be successful due to inability to recruit sufficient numbers of study subjects. This study does not reveal a higher than expected risk of recurrent thromboembolic disease compared to historical cohorts; however, this is an uncontrolled study in relatively low-risk APS patients.

Recent studies suggest that attachment and depressive symptoms may act as a filter in the perception of partner responsiveness, and a barrier to the capacity of being responsive to a partner. Given studies suggesting higher depressive symptoms and relationship insecurities in women experiencing genito-pelvic pain compared to controls, investigating the role of these factors in partner responsiveness may help couples improve their wellbeing in the challenging context of PVD. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between depressive symptoms, attachment, and perceived and observed partner responsiveness in 50 couples coping with PVD. Participants took part in a videotaped discussion and completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, attachment, and perceived partner responsiveness. Based on the actor-partner interdependence model, results indicated that when women and partners reported greater depressive symptoms and anxious attachment, they perceived each other as being less responsive. When partners experienced greater depressive symptoms, women and partners were rated, by a trained observer, as being less responsive to each other.

According to the EMPDS, self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism indirectly influence depressive symptoms through rumination and difficulty accepting the past. Yet, the extent to which self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, rumination, and difficulty accepting the past uniquely and collectively influence depressive symptoms is unestablished. Likewise, supporting evidence derives from relatively healthy university students, rendering the generalizability of the EMPDS to more distressed individuals unclear. Our study addressed these important limitations. Data were obtained from 393 depressed individuals. Congruent with the EMPDS, bias-corrected bootstrapped tests of mediation indicated that socially prescribed perfectionism indirectly predicted depressive symptoms through rumination and difficulty accepting the past. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism indirectly predicted depressive symptoms through rumination, but not difficulty accepting the past.

It is treated initially with a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at the bedside. Due to the high stakes and urgency of this complication, teaching this in the clinical setting is difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a cadaveric model for addressing this problem. METHODS A fresh-frozen human cadaveric model of RH was created using a Foley catheter to simulate elevated intraocular pressure. Residents who participated in an emergencies in otolaryngology-head & neck surgery camp were included in the study. A survey measuring confidence levels in performing lateral canthotomy and cantholysis was administered. After completing the skill station, a postintervention survey was administered to assess the confidence of the learner as well as fidelity and usefulness of the task trainer. RESULTS Thirty-three residents participated in the boot camp. Residents rated their confidence preintervention at 1.3/5, which suggests the majority were unable to perform the procedure. After using the model, residents rated their confidence at 3.5/5, which falls between basic knowledge and reasonably confident; this improvement achieved statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The fidelity of the model was rated 3.9/5; a score of  is defined as realistic. The residents rated the usefulness of the model as 4.7; a score of  is defined as very useful.

Preceptor, or clinical teacher, recruitment at these sites has been an ongoing challenge. However, residents-as-teachers (RaT) curricula have not been modified to support the development of rural teachers. This study aimed to compare teaching opportunities between rural and urban family medicine residents and to identify mechanisms underlying potential differences. METHODS Year- and Year- family medicine residents at seven Canadian institutions participated in a mixed-methods study utilising a quantitative survey and a qualitative interview. Rural and urban residents rated the quantity and types of teaching opportunities available during their training, from which a chi-squared analysis was completed. Volunteer respondents participated in a structured interview, from which a thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS Rural family medicine residents had fewer opportunities to teach compared to their urban colleagues. This discrepancy was seen across multiple domains, including informal opportunities when on family medicine rotations, χ2 (4, n = 242) = 45.26, P < .000, Bonferroni's adjusted P < .000. Thematic analysis centred around determining factors influencing teaching opportunities and identified that the academic context, personal factors and programme factors were key dimensions. Within these dimensions, the number of medical students, a desire to be an educator and administrative support were cited as influences on teaching opportunities. CONCLUSIONS The lack of teaching opportunities for rural trainees is attributable to a combination of practical and organisational factors revealed through thematic analysis. If rural graduates are not comfortable balancing the demands of service and teaching, this could compound the already prevalent issue of rural preceptor recruitment.

Methods Using the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists' e-mail distribution list, all members were sent an invitation and link to an online electronic survey. The survey included demographics and questions asking participants about their perceptions of EBP, research, and barriers. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and partial proportional odds models. Results Four hundred and forty-four completed surveys were available for analysis. Respondents showed good distribution among professions and geographical location. Eighty-four percent of respondents indicated having a good grasp of the concept of EBP. A majority of the respondents (>70%) in all the professions strongly agreed/agreed that all MRTs should practice in an evidence-based manner. Eighty percent of respondents strongly agreed/agreed that there is a link between EBP and research. There was a statistically significant association between the current level of knowledge to develop a research project and level of academic research education received, research culture in the department, and the presence of barriers. Partial proportional odds model indicates participants were more likely to have a good grasp of EBP and have strongly agreed/agreed that they should practice in an evidence-based manner if they were a radiation therapist, have medium-high current levels of research knowledge, or were a permanent full-time employee. In addition, radiation therapists were at least 4 times more likely to participate in research as a primary or coinvestigator, compared to other MRT professions. Most frequently identified extrinsic barriers to EBP/research included lack of time, heavy workload, lack of leadership support, and workplace attitudes/culture. Extrinsic success factors included access to a mentor, dedicated time, collaboration, and support from management and peers. Intrinsic success factors were as follows: self-motivation, sense of inquiry/curiosity, and satisfaction with creating patient or workplace change based on research.

OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to over-stimulation of cholinergic synapses and can cause status epilepticus (SE). OPs poisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and death. Despite termination of SE, recurrent seizures and abnormal brain activity remain common sequelae often associated with long-term neural damage and cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, early treatment for prevention of seizures is of high interest. Using a rat model of paraoxon poisoning, we tested the efficacy of different neuroprotective and anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in suppressing early seizures and preventing brain damage. Electrocorticographic recordings were performed prior, during and after injection of 4.5 LD50 paraoxon, followed by injections of atropine and toxogonin (obidoxime) to prevent death. Thirty minutes later, rats were injected with midazolam alone or in combination with different AEDs (lorazepam, valproic acid, phenytoin) or neuroprotective drugs (losartan, isoflurane). Outcome measures included SE duration, early seizures frequency and epileptiform activity duration in the first 24 -hs after poisoning. To assess delayed brain damage, we performed T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging one month after poisoning. SE duration and the number of recurrent seizures were not affected by the addition of any of the drugs tested. Delayed brain injury was most prominent in the septum, striatum, amygdala and piriform network. Only isoflurane anesthesia significantly reduced brain damage. We show that acute treatment with isoflurane, but not AEDs, reduces brain damage following SE. This may offer a new therapeutic approach for exposed individuals.",2020-02-18,Neurotoxicology,https://openalex.org/V115834843,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.02.007,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008977831,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.02.007,journal-article,3008977831

However, construct–level models of personality may conceal indicator–level personality–outcome associations. The current study aims to investigate evolution of the network constellation of personality and cannabis/alcohol use from early to late adolescence. Data comes from the longitudinal Co–Venture cohort (N = 3800). Personality indicators, measured by Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS) items, and the frequency of cannabis/alcohol use were assessed at four consecutive years (13–17 years old). Network constellations of the SURPS items and cannabis/alcohol use were estimated using Bayesian Gaussian graphical models at four time points. Results highlighted the age–specific associations between personality indicators and substance use. The positive role of the sensation–seeking trait (e.g. attitude towards transgression) was constant, whereas the positive role of hopelessness indicators (e.g. not being enthusiastic about future) and the negative role of anxiety–sensitivity indicators (e.g. fear of having unusual body sensations) were more prominent at early adolescence. The current study provides a novel perspective on the network structure of personality and substance use in adolescence and suggests substance–specific and age–adjusted targets in intervention efforts. © 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology",2020-12-01,European Journal of Personality,https://openalex.org/V13823553,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2245,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011614056,https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2245,journal-article,3011614056

Multiple medical and surgical management strategies have been utilized, but results have been inconsistent. The present case series describes management of delayed hypotony associated with the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI) by surgically introducing 4-0 polypropylene suture into the tube lumen. Observations The cases of four patients who presented with hypotony following BGI surgery were reviewed. Following BGI tube lumen occlusion with suture, sustained intraocular pressure increase (mean 7.25 mmHg, range 4–14) was noted in all patients and visual acuity improved in three cases. Conclusions and importance This is the first report of ab interno suture occlusion of the BGI for management of post-operative hypotony.

Surgical trainees’ perceptions of and receptiveness to cross-specialty assessment,"Abstract Introduction Competency-based medical education (CBME) hinges on robust assessment. However, integrating regular workplace-based assessment within demanding and sometimes chaotic clinical environments remains challenging. Many faculty lack assessment expertise, and some programs lack the infrastructure and faculty numbers to fulfill CBME’s mandate. Recognizing this, we designed and implemented an assessment innovation that trains and deploys a cadre of faculty to assess in specialties outside their own. Specifically, we explored trainees’ perceptions of and receptiveness to this novel assessment approach. Methods Within Western University’s Surgical Foundations program, 27 PGY‑1 trainees were formatively assessed by trained non-surgeons on a basic laparoscopic surgical skill. These assessments did not impact trainees’ progression. Four focus groups were conducted to gauge residents’ sentiments about the experience of cross-specialty assessment. Data were then analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results While a few trainees found the experience motivating, more often trainees questioned the feedback they received and the practicality of this assessment approach to advance their procedural skill acquisition. What trainees wanted were strategies for improvement, not merely an assessment of performance. Discussion Trainees’ trepidation at the idea of using outside assessors to meet increased assessment demands appeared grounded in their expectations for assessment. What trainees appeared to desire was a coach—someone who could break their performance into its critical individual components—as opposed to an assessor whose role was limited to scoring their performance. Understanding trainees’ receptivity to new assessment approaches is crucial; otherwise training programs run the risk of generating more assessments without added value.",2020-08-01,Perspectives on medical education,https://openalex.org/V2764699106,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-020-00594-0,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033565505,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-020-00594-0,journal-article,3033565505

Underpinning these supports and services are structures of care that are reflected in home care policies, programs and practices within jurisdictions. These approaches to care exist at multiple levels and inform interactions, perceptions, and care assessment, planning and provision, ultimately shaping the supports that are delivered. Jurisdictional differences in approaches to care mean that pathways through home care systems may differ, depending on where one lives. The goal of this study is to understand how approaches to care shape the pathways of older adult home care clients with chronic and long term conditions in two Canadian health jurisdictions. Methods This longitudinal mixed-methods study has three interrelated research streams informed by aspects of the socio-ecological framework. We will examine client pathways using a retrospective analysis of home care assessment data (Resident Assessment Instrument- Home Care) in two health authorities (Client/Service Data Stream). We will analyze interview data from older adult home care clients and a cluster of each client’s family or friend caregiver(s), home support worker(s), care/case coordinator(s) and potentially other professionals at up to three points over 18 months using a prospective qualitative comparative case study design (Constellation Data Stream). We will review home care policies relevant to both health authorities and interview key informants regarding the creation and implementation of policies (Policy Stream). Our study will apply an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach that engages knowledge users in research design, analysis and interpretation to facilitate relevancy of results. Discussion Applying a mixed-method research design to understand approaches to care within and between two jurisdictions will contribute to the evidence base on older adult home care client pathways. Study results will identify how potential differences are experienced by clients and their families. An understanding of the policies will help to contextualize these findings.

Failure to measure or manipulate these factors may compromise study reliability and validity. This is especially relevant for double-blind placebo-controlled research of nicotine, tobacco, and related substances. In this article, we review laboratory-based human research of the impact of non-pharmacological factors on responses to tobacco and nicotine administration. Results suggest that varying beliefs about drug content and effects, perceptions about drug use opportunities, and intentions to cease drug use systematically alter subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses to nicotine, tobacco, and placebo administration. These non-pharmacological factors should be considered when designing and interpreting the findings of human research of nicotine and tobacco effects, particularly when a double-blind placebo-controlled design is used. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed, and we propose methodological strategies to enhance the reliability and validity of future research. Implications Growing research demonstrates that non-pharmacological factors systematically alter responses to acute nicotine, tobacco, and placebo administration. Indeed, varying beliefs about nicotine and/or tobacco administration and effects, differing perceptions about nicotine and/or tobacco use opportunities, and inconsistent motivation to quit smoking have been found to exert important influences on subjective, physiological, and behavioral responses. These variables are infrequently measured or manipulated in nicotine and tobacco research, which compromises the validity of study findings.

We consider different variants of this problem. The first variant, called UNRESTRICTED MINIMAL EPISODES INFERENCE, aims at inferring a species tree based on a model with speciation and duplication where duplications are clustered in duplication episodes. The goal is to minimize the number of such episodes. The second variant, PARENTAL HYBRIDIZATION, aims at inferring a species network based on a model with speciation and reticulation. The goal is to minimize the number of reticulation events. It is a variant of the well-studied HYBRIDIZATION NUMBER problem with a more generous view on which gene trees are consistent with a given species network. We show that these seemingly different problems are in fact closely related and can, surprisingly, both be solved in polynomial time, using a structure we call “beaded trees”. However, we also show that methods based on these problems have to be used with care because the optimal species phylogenies always have a restricted form.

The model is evaluated against observed tidal elevations and tidal currents, and the evaluation indicates that the model is able to reproduce the observations at the tidal gauge sites, particularly those in the narrow straits of the CAA. In order to examine the interactions between the Arctic and the Atlantic tides in the CAA, idealized experiments were conducted by considering tidal effects through the open boundary on the Arctic and the Atlantic sides separately. The results show that the Atlantic tide is strong throughout the CAA but deceases rapidly when it encounters the open Arctic shelf for both M2 and K1 tides; on the other hand, the Arctic tide is mainly confined to the Arctic Ocean and Amundsen Gulf; it has a minor influence in the Baffin Bay. Nonlinear interactions between the Arctic and Atlantic tides are generally weak except local areas in the southern and northern CAA, where the nonlinear contribution is able to reach 10–20% of the tidal variability. Using the model results, the tidal energy flux was also analyzed, and the analysis indicated that the Lancaster Sound and Jones Sound are main pathways of the tidal energy from the Baffin Bay to the CAA, and the energy is dissipated due mainly to the vertical diffusion and the bottom friction.",2020-05-05,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,https://openalex.org/V43867544,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106617,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003856691,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106617,journal-article,3003856691

DESIGN Multi-centre prospective cohort study analysing audio- and video-recorded patient/parent-physician interactions. SETTING Two tertiary paediatric hospitals in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Salt Lake City, Utah. PARTICIPANTS Paediatric otolaryngologists, patients and parents during consultation for adenotonsillectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Medical dialogue measures (turn analysis, patient-centredness scores via the Roter Interaction Analysis System) and SDM questionnaires (SDM-Q-9). RESULTS Turn density was significantly higher for physicians than patients/parents (P < .001), as were total statements (P < .001), and total time talking (P < .001). The opening statement was completed by the physician in 91.5% of interactions and was significantly longer than family opening statements (P = .003).

This application uses an hourly and daily Global Solar Radiation prediction model and is fed live weather forecast data directly from a weather application program interface. Unlike Time-of-Use Price-scheduling, the proposed scheduling system is based on the amount of predicted generated solar energy and the behavior of the load. In the first phase of operation, live weather data are collected using a weather application program interface. In the second phase, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using five-year weather-solar radiation data recorded for a North American city (2000–2004). Then, the Global Solar Radiation is predicted for ten days and compared with actual values for 2005. The cumulative hourly and daily energy and optimal days in the ten days are also obtained. In the final phase, household activities that consume hot water, such as washing dishes, using the washing machine, and taking a shower or bath are rescheduled to utilize the generated energy, which maximizes savings and minimizes emissions.",2020-04-01,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,https://openalex.org/V2764877105,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2020.100644,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004316630,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2020.100644,journal-article,3004316630

We bound the maximum modulus, $$\text {maxmod}(n)$$, of an independence root over all graphs on n vertices and the maximum modulus, $$\text {maxmod}_{T}(n)$$, of an independence root over all trees on n vertices in terms of n. In particular, we show that $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\log _3(\text {maxmod}(n))}{n}=\frac{1}{3}+o(1) \end{aligned}$$and $$\begin{aligned} \frac{\log _2(\text {maxmod}_{T}(n))}{n}=\frac{1}{2}+o(1). \end{aligned}$$",2020-05-01,Graphs and Combinatorics,https://openalex.org/V186126824,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00373-020-02160-1,,,,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011118259,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00373-020-02160-1,journal-article,3011118259

We examined the practice context and responsibilities of this little-known understudied workforce. Method Data from Nursing Practice in Rural and Remote Canada II, a 201 to 201 pan-Canadian survey, were analyzed. Results Of 3,822 respondents, 19 identified that PC was their only practice focus (PC-Only), and for 111, it was one focus among others (PC-Plus). Proportionally more PC-Only than PC-Plus nurses had graduate education, were employed in larger communities and had experienced higher job resources and lower job demands. Proportionally fewer PC-Only than PC-Plus nurses followed protocols/decision support tools, dispensed medications and provided emergency services. Proportionally more PC-Only than PC-Plus nurses ordered advanced diagnostic tests/imaging, and fewer PC-Only than PC-Plus nurses performed and interpreted laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging on site. Conclusion Contributions of the rural and remote nursing workforce to PC are rendered invisible by contemporary characterizations of the PC workplace, limiting evaluation and improvement efforts.",2020-02-28,Healthcare policy,https://openalex.org/V4210211288,,https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2020.26130,,,,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011149504,https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2020.26130,journal-article,3011149504
