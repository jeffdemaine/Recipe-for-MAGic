Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 10 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 2 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.",2020-02-07,Journal of Clinical Medicine,https://openalex.org/V2737969411,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462,462,462,9,2,1,818,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007580879,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462,journal-article,3007580879

Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 . Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4–50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4–75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.",2020-04-21,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004064117,9122,9126,117,16,1,355,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014842224,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004064117,journal-article,3014842224

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th , 202 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below  and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.",2020-01-01,Infectious Disease Modelling,https://openalex.org/V2898427929,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001,248,255,5,,1,348,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006028839,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001,journal-article,3006028839

Within  mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 56 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 2 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 77 cases (95% CI: 63 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 202 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average.

The socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures. In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission. However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individual-level data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections. We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections. Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold. We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over one-third of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population. Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, in order to safely lift current restrictions and minimize the risk of resurgence.",2020-07-28,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008373117,17513,17515,117,30,1,301,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3040264860,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008373117,journal-article,3040264860

To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian–driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention.

The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing.

SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging.

Accumulation strategies have changed as a result of this assetization process. Rather than entrepreneurial strategies based on commodity production, technoscientific capitalism is increasingly underpinned by rentiership or the appropriation of value through ownership and control rights (e.g., intellectual property [IP]), monopoly conditions, and regulatory or market devices and practices (e.g., investment dispute courts, exclusivity agreements). While rentiership is often presented as a negative phenomenon (e.g., distorting markets, unearned income) in both neoclassical and Marxist political economy literatures—and much in between—in this paper, I conceptualize rentiership as a technoeconomic practice and process framed by insights from science and technology studies (STS). So, rather than a problematic “side effect” of capitalism, the concept of rentiership enables us to understand how different forms of value extraction constitute, and are constituted by, different forms of technoscience.

As Virtual Reality (VR) technologies become increasingly accessible and affordable, there is a unique opportunity to enable older adults to escape their restricted physical realities and be transported to both stimulating and calming places which may improve their general well-being. To date no robust evaluations of the use of immersive VR therapy [experienced through a head-mounted-display (HMD)] for older adults within these settings have been reported. VR-therapy may prove to be a safe, inexpensive, non-pharmacological means of managing depressive symptoms and providing engagement and enjoyment to this rapidly growing demographic. Objectives: Establish whether it is feasible to use immersive VR technology as therapy for older adults who have reduced sensory, mobility and/or impaired cognition. This includes evaluation of tolerability, comfort, and ease of use of the HMD, and of the potential for immersive VR to provide enjoyment/relaxation and reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods: Sixty-six older adults (mean age 80.5, SD = 10.5) with varying cognitive abilities (normal = 28, mild impairment = 17, moderate impairment = 12, severe impairment = 3, unknown cognitive score = 6), and/or physical impairments, entered a multi-site non-randomized interventional study in Toronto, Canada. Participants experienced  to 2 min of 360°-video footage of nature scenes displayed on Samsung GearVR HMD. Data was collected through pre/post-intervention surveys, standardized observations during intervention, and post-intervention semi-structured interviews addressing the VR experience. Results: All participants completed the study with no negative side-effects reported (e.g., No dizziness, disorientation, interference with hearing aids); the average time spent in VR was  min and 76% of participants viewed the entire experience at least once. Participants tolerated the HMD very well; most had positive feedback, feeling more relaxed and adventurous; 76% wanted to try VR again.

Existing approaches either learn sub-optimal solutions, require joint training, or incur a substantial increment in the number of parameters for each added domain, typically as many as the original network. We propose a method called Deep Adaptation Modules (DAM) that constrains newly learned filters to be linear combinations of existing ones. DAMs precisely preserve performance on the original domain, require a fraction (typically 1 percent, dependent on network architecture) of the number of parameters compared to standard fine-tuning procedures and converge in less cycles of training to a comparable or better level of performance. When coupled with standard network quantization techniques, we further reduce the parameter cost to around  percent of the original with negligible or no loss in accuracy. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains. We conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our method on a range of image classification tasks and explore different aspects of its behavior.",2020-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,https://openalex.org/V199944782,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2018.2884462,651,663,42,3,1,64,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962707369,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2018.2884462,journal-article,2962707369

However, important knowledge gaps still exist regarding the extent of their use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly at the primary care level. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies conducted in primary care in LMICs to estimate the prevalence of antibiotic prescriptions as well as the proportion of such prescriptions that are inappropriate.We searched PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and CENTRAL for articles published between  January 201 and  April 201 without language restrictions. We subsequently updated our search on PubMed only to capture publications up to 1 March 2020. Studies conducted in LMICs (defined as per the World Bank criteria) reporting data on medicine use in primary care were included. Three reviewers independently screened citations by title and abstract, whereas the full-text evaluation of all selected records was performed by  reviewers, who also conducted data extraction and quality assessment. A modified version of a tool developed by Hoy and colleagues was utilized to evaluate the risk of bias of each included study. Meta-analyses using random-effects models were performed to identify the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics. The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) framework was used to classify prescribed antibiotics. We identified 4 studies from 2 LMICs, mostly conducted in the public sector and in urban areas, and predominantly based on medical records abstraction and/or drug prescription audits. The pooled prevalence proportion of antibiotic prescribing was 52% (95% CI: 51%-53%), with a prediction interval of 44%-60%. Individual studies' estimates were consistent across settings. Only  studies assessed rationality, and the proportion of inappropriate prescription among patients with various conditions ranged from 8% to 100%. Among  studies in  countries that reported details on prescribed antibiotics, Access-group antibiotics accounted for more than 60% of the total in  countries. The interpretation of pooled estimates is limited by the considerable between-study heterogeneity. Also, most of the available studies suffer from methodological issues and report insufficient details to assess appropriateness of prescription.Antibiotics are highly prescribed in primary care across LMICs. Although a subset of studies reported a high proportion of inappropriate use, the true extent could not be assessed due to methodological limitations. Yet, our findings highlight the need for urgent action to improve prescription practices, starting from the integration of WHO treatment recommendations and the AWaRe classification into national guidelines.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019123269.",2020-06-16,PLOS Medicine,https://openalex.org/V197939330,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003139,e1003139,e1003139,17,6,1,57,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035568588,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003139,journal-article,3035568588

After decades of CSR studies, we do not have an answer. In this review, we analyze progression of the CSR literature toward assessing the performance of CSR initiatives, identify factors that have limited the literature’s progress, and suggest a new approach to the study of CSR that can overcome these limits. We begin with comprehensive bibliometric mapping illustrating that although social impact has infrequently been its explicit focus, the CSR literature has measured outcomes other than firm performance, especially in the current decade. Thereafter, we conduct a more fine-grained analysis of recent CSR studies. Adapting a logic model framework, we show that even the most highly cited studies have stopped short of assessing social impact, often measuring CSR activities rather than impacts and focusing on benefits to specific stakeholders rather than to wider society. In combination, our analyses suggest that assessment of the performance of CSR initiatives has been driven by the availability of large, public secondary data sources. However, creating more such databases and turning to “big data” analyses are inadequate solutions. Drawing from the impact evaluation literature of development economics, we argue that the CSR field should reconceive itself as a science of design in which researchers formulate CSR initiatives that seek to achieve specific social and environmental objectives. In accordance with this pursuit, CSR researchers should move toward “small data” research designs, which will enable studies to better determine causation rather than just identify correlation.",2020-01-27,Journal of Management,https://openalex.org/V122767448,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206319900539,937,964,46,6,0,56,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004367191,https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206319900539,journal-article,3004367191

In this paper, we highlight key challenges associated with talent (athlete) identification and development and propose possible solutions that could be considered by research and practice. The first challenge focuses on clarifying the purposes of talent identification initiatives such as defining what talent is and how its meaning might evolve over time. Challenge two centers on ways to best identify, select and develop talent, including issues with different approaches to identification, the need to understand the impact of development and the need to have appropriate resourcing in the system to support continued development of knowledge. Finally, we discuss two challenges in relation to the 'healthiness' of talent identification and development. The first examines whether a talent identification and development system is 'healthy' for athletes while the second focuses on how sport stakeholders could discourage the apparent trend toward early specialization in youth sport settings. Whilst this paper discusses the research in relation to these challenges, we propose multiple possible solutions that researchers and practitioners could consider for optimizing their approach to talent identification and development.

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for  potential biases in crude CFR. <h3>METHODS:</h3> We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 3 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%–50%). <h3>RESULTS:</h3> Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%–6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%–3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%–6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%–3.6%). <h3>INTERPRETATION:</h3> Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%.

Further, this study examines the relevance of the mechanics of traditional composite laminates for characterizing the mechanical behaviour of printed parts. Initially, test coupons were 3D printed with different layer thicknesses and printing directions. The test coupons were then subjected to mechanical testing. Test results reveal that the tensile properties of thin-layered printed parts are better than those of thick-layered printed parts, but not the interlaminar properties. Thick-layered parts performed poorly under tensile loads because of the presence of undesirable enclosed voids within the extruded fibers (extrudates). Further, laminate theory accurately predicted the mechanical behaviour of thin-layered bidirectionally printed parts. The failure surface followed the orientation of extrudates in unidirectionally printed parts. The micro-CT analysis unveiled microstructural features, such as the orientation of SCFs along the printing direction, the presence of enclosed voids within the extrudates of thick-layered parts, and a reduction in maximum length of SCF in thin-layered parts; such features influenced the final mechanical behaviour of the printed parts.",2020-01-01,Engineering Failure Analysis,https://openalex.org/V152303250,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104232,104232,104232,107,,0,43,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979328847,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104232,journal-article,2979328847

As meteorological conditions are uncontrollable, this study aims to investigate how anthropogenic factors affect the PM2.5 concentration under high, medium and low emission levels. The distribution of socioeconomic variables is often non-normal, with important information hidden in the tail. By using balanced panel data of 27 Chinese cities from 201 to 2016, two-step panel quantile regression is adopted to examine the cross-quantile heterogeneity of seven socioeconomic variables: economic growth, industrial structure, urbanization, foreign direct investment (FDI), population density, public transportation and energy consumption. The empirical results show that the relationships of PM2.5 concentration with economic growth, urbanization, industrialization and FDI are heterogeneous. Compared with other variables, population density exerts the greatest positive effect on PM2.5 pollution across all quantile cities. Moreover, the impact of GDP per capita on PM2.5 concentration in the lower 25th quantile cities is stronger than those in the 25th-50th, 50th-75th and upper 75th quantile cities. The effects of FDI in the upper 75th and lower 25th quantile cities are higher than those in the 25th-50th and 50th-75th quantile cities, which supports the “pollution haven” hypothesis. The impact of industrial structure on PM2.5 concentration in the upper 75th quantile cities is larger than those in the 0-25th, 25th-50th, and 50th-75th quantile cities.

This critical interpretive synthesis analyzes the appropriateness of wealth indices for measuring social health inequalities and provides an overview of alternative methods to calculate wealth indices using data captured in standardized household surveys. Our aggregation of all published associations of wealth indices indicates a mean Spearman’s rho of 0.4 and 0.5 with income and consumption, respectively. Context-specific factors such as country development level may affect the concordance of health and educational outcomes with wealth indices and urban–rural disparities can be more pronounced using wealth indices compared to income or consumption. Synthesis of potential future uses of wealth indices suggests that it is possible to quantify wealth inequality using household assets, that the index can be used to study SES across national boundaries, and that technological innovations may soon change how asset wealth is measured. Finally, a review of alternative approaches to constructing household asset indices suggests lack of evidence of superiority for count measures, item response theory, and Mokken scale analysis, but points to evidence-based advantages for multiple correspondence analysis, polychoric PCA and predicted income.

Conventional imperfect acquisition processes of 3D point cloud-e.g., stereo-matching from multiple viewpoint images or depth data acquired directly from active light sensors-imply non-negligible noise in the data. In this paper, we extend a previously proposed low-dimensional manifold model for the image patches to surface patches in the point cloud, and seek self-similar patches to denoise them simultaneously using the patch manifold prior. Due to discrete observations of the patches on the manifold, we approximate the manifold dimension computation defined in the continuous domain with a patch-based graph Laplacian regularizer, and propose a new discrete patch distance measure to quantify the similarity between two same-sized surface patches for graph construction that is robust to noise. We show that our graph Laplacian regularizer leads to speedy implementation and has desirable numerical stability properties given its natural graph spectral interpretation.

In May 201 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups—scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth—launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 15 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of  million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1] . A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy.",2020-07-01,Energy research and social science,https://openalex.org/V2764593084,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101442,101442,101442,65,,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008786884,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101442,journal-article,3008786884

A set of objects is indeed not only characterized by its numerosity but also by other features, such as the summed area occupied by the elements, which often covary with numerosity. These intrinsic relations between numerosity and nonnumerical magnitudes led some authors to argue that numerosity is not independently processed but extracted through a weighting of continuous magnitudes. This view cannot be properly tested through classic behavioral and neuroimaging approaches due to these intrinsic correlations. The current study used a frequency-tagging EEG approach to separately measure responses to numerosity as well as to continuous magnitudes. We recorded occipital responses to numerosity, total area, and convex hull changes but not to density and dot size. We additionally applied a model predicting primary visual cortex responses to the set of stimuli. The model output was closely aligned with our electrophysiological data, since it predicted discrimination only for numerosity, total area, and convex hull. Our findings thus demonstrate that numerosity can be independently processed at an early stage in the visual cortex, even when completely isolated from other magnitude changes. The similar implicit discrimination for numerosity as for some continuous magnitudes, which correspond to basic visual percepts, shows that both can be extracted independently, hence substantiating the nature of numerosity as a primary feature of the visual scene.",2020-03-17,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917849117,5726,5732,117,11,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009747840,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917849117,journal-article,3009747840

We aim to equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with mathematical model-based quantification of implemented public health measures and estimation of the trend of COVID-19 in Ontario to inform future actions in terms of outbreak control and de-escalation of social distancing. Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact. We show that improved case detection rate plays a decisive role to reduce the effective reproduction number, and there is still much room in terms of improving personal protection measures to compensate for the strict social distancing measures.",2020-05-26,Journal of Mathematics in Industry,https://openalex.org/V3035098766,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-020-00083-3,,,10,1,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031181470,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-020-00083-3,journal-article,3031181470

The spectra confirm a galaxy with no significant ongoing star formation, consistent with the lack of rest-frame UV flux and overall photometric spectral energy distribution. With a stellar mass of $3.1^{+0.1}_{-0.2} \times 10^{11} ~\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z = 3.493$, this galaxy is nearly three times more massive than the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed absorption-line identified galaxy known.

2020,8,2,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2949560916,Weaving network theory into effectuation: A multi-level reconceptualization of effectual dynamics,"This paper positions effectuation as a network-driving and network dependent phenomenon and suggests that understanding networks and network processes is essential to understanding the dynamics of effectuation. We argue that the implementation of effectuation is influenced by the nodal, relational, and structural characteristics of pre-existing and emerging networks, and by the processes through which these networks come about. We use these arguments to develop a multi-level, multi-theoretical reconceptualization of effectuation that provides for distributed agency and collective cognition of network members. We allow for the simultaneous and interactional use of effectual and causal logics, as well as the co-construction of knowledge, identity, and social capital within and across network levels. Our model also addresses changing uncertainty as opportunities develop, nuances of effectual interactions, and evolving market dynamics. Our propositions and reflections offer directions for further studies at the intersection of network and effectuation research. There is little doubt that effectuation is reshaping how we think about entrepreneurial cognition and behavior. A core argument is that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs can co-create opportunities by collaborating with other willful agents. This moves us away from classical views of entrepreneurship and positions effectuation as a network-driving and network-dependent phenomenon. Yet, recent debate highlights that effectuation research has paid insufficient attention to the network of external parties involved. As a result, although the extant model of effectuation recognizes the importance of networks, our understanding of the relationship between effectual logic and entrepreneurial networks is far from complete. Several theoretically important and practically relevant questions arise from this knowledge gap. For example if we think about network development, how are potential stakeholders brought to mind and persuaded to commit if end-points and stakeholder preferences are both unknowable? What are the characteristics (i.e. structure, content and governance) of the networks that emerge through these commitments? Reciprocally, how do the characteristics of the emerging network influence effectual processes and outcomes? In this paper, we begin to address this line of questioning by considering effectuation not only at the level of the individual but also through lenses reflective of the three levels of analysis commonly adopted in network research: i) dyadic relationships, ii) the entrepreneurial network, and iii) the market more generally. While we attend to pre-existing networks (the constitution of which is likely to affect the probability of adopting effectual logic), our focus is on linking the individual and emerging networks across these levels. At the level of the individual, we break from prior effectuation research and ascribe new and influential roles to entrepreneurial ideas and instrumental mindsets in focusing an entrepreneur's attention on particular relationships (i.e. the cognitive activation of a cohesive network involving interested and persuadable individuals). At the level of the dyad, we suggest the very nature of interactions between actors can influence individual choice of logic. We specify that stakeholders will expect signs of process legitimacy (e.g. cognitive flexibility on the part of the entrepreneur) before making effectual commitments. We also move away from assumptions about altruistic behavior to suggest that power and influence will accrue to stakeholders whose resources are at risk and/or perceived by others to resolve uncertainty. At the level of the entrepreneurial network, we link effectuation to a brokerage orientation ( tertius iungens) that enhances inclusiveness surrounding means and collective cognition. Moreover, we move beyond the narrow view of facilitating and constraining factors portrayed in the effectuation literature to argue that (e.g.) i) with respect to network content, resource specificity will shape possible futures; ii) with respect to governance, trust, supported by social mechanisms will predominate; and, iii) with respect to structure, specific network characteristics will be more supportive of certain aspects of effectuation than others (e.g. cohesive networks are more supportive of collaboration, but may limit the flexibility needed to embrace contingencies). At the market level, we posit that on the one hand, institutions will shape effectual processes. On the other hand, effectual processes are more likely than causal processes to create new institutions and/or supplant existing institutions. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of both effectuation and networks by offering a multi-level, multi-theoretical re-conceptualization of the dynamics of effectuation. Our arguments should spur research in at least three interdependent areas: i) uncertainty and individual cognition; ii) network processes surrounding interactions and commitments; and iii) the contingent effects of network characteristics on effectuation. For practitioners, our insights should help shape thoughts about i) who to interact with in the face of uncertainty; ii) what stories to tell and how to deal with image management; iii) what to expect during negotiations; iv) how to broker relationships to enhance the ‘co’ in ‘co-creation’; and moreover, v) what network characteristics might facilitate or constrain their efforts. • Network constitution influences the propensity to rely upon effectual logic. • Network contexts and decision logics vary across entrepreneurial idea dimensions. • Commitment decisions require evidence of process legitimacy. • Balancing elements of cohesive and diverse networks enhances effectual productivity. • Market lifecycle stage influences individual and collective cognition/behavior.",2020-03-01,Journal of Business Venturing,https://openalex.org/V66201313,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.05.001,105937,105937,35,2,0,31,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2949560916,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.05.001,journal-article,2949560916

We examined the association between fluoride exposure in infancy and intellectual ability in children who lived in fluoridated or non-fluoridated cities in Canada. Methods We examined 398 mother-child dyads in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals cohort who reported drinking tap water. We estimated water fluoride concentration using municipal water reports. We used linear regression to analyze the association between fluoride exposure and IQ scores, measured by the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence-III at 3–4 years. We examined whether feeding status (breast-fed versus formula-fed) modified the impact of water fluoride and if fluoride exposure during fetal development attenuated this effect. A second model estimated the association between fluoride intake from formula and child IQ. Results Thirty-eight percent of mother-child dyads lived in fluoridated communities. An increase of 0.5 mg/L in water fluoride concentration (approximately equaling the difference between fluoridated and non-fluoridated regions) corresponded to a 9.3- and 6.2-point decrement in Performance IQ among formula-fed (95% CI: −13.77, −4.76) and breast-fed children (95% CI: −10.45, −1.94).

Most neural models focus on incorporating the aspect representation into attention, however, the position information of each aspect is not studied well. Furthermore, the existing ASC datasets are relatively small owing to the labor-intensive labeling that largely limits the performance of NNs. In this paper, we propose a position-aware hierarchical transfer (PAHT) model that models the position information from multiple levels and enhances the ASC performance by transferring hierarchical knowledge from the resource-rich sentence-level sentiment classification (SSC) dataset. We first present aspect-based positional attention in the word and the segment levels to capture more salient information toward a given aspect. To make up for the limited data for ASC, we devise three sampling strategies to select related instances from the large-scale SSC dataset for pre-training and transfer the learned knowledge into ASC from four levels: embedding, word, segment and classifier . Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in improving the performance of ASC.

We use a homogeneously selected sample of field and cluster galaxies whose membership is derived from dynamical analysis. Using [$\rm{O{\small II}}$]-derived star formation rates (SFRs), we find that cluster galaxies have suppressed SFRs at fixed stellar mass in comparison to their field counterparts by a factor of 1. ± 0.1 (∼3.3σ) across the stellar mass range: 9.0 &amp;lt; log (M*/M⊙) &amp;lt; 11.2. We also find that this modest suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the difference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and lower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy SFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower SFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR galaxies as seen in the field. Given this observed suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence, we explore the implications for several scenarios such as formation time differences between cluster and field galaxies, and environmentally induced star formation quenching and associated time-scales.",2020-04-21,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa579,5987,6000,493,4,1,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007614809,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa579,journal-article,3007614809

Existing graph learning algorithms compute the most likely entries of a properly defined graph Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}$, but require a large number of signal observations $\mathbf{z}$'s for a stable estimate. In this work, we assume instead the availability of a relevant feature vector $\mathbf{f}_i$ per node $i$, from which we compute an optimal feature graph via optimization of a feature metric. Specifically, we alternately optimize the diagonal and off-diagonal entries of a Mahalanobis distance matrix $\mathbf{M}$ by minimizing the graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) $\mathbf{z}^{\top} \mathbf{L} \mathbf{z}$, where edge weight is $w_{i,j} = \exp\{-(\mathbf{f}_i - \mathbf{f}_j)^{\top} \mathbf{M} (\mathbf{f}_i - \mathbf{f}_j) \}$, given a single observation $\mathbf{z}$. We optimize diagonal entries via proximal gradient (PG), where we constrain $\mathbf{M}$ to be positive definite (PD) via linear inequalities derived from the Gershgorin circle theorem. To optimize off-diagonal entries, we design a block descent algorithm that iteratively optimizes one row and column of $\mathbf{M}$. To keep $\mathbf{M}$ PD, we constrain the Schur complement of sub-matrix $\mathbf{M}_{2,2}$ of $\mathbf{M}$ to be PD when optimizing via PG. Our algorithm mitigates full eigen-decomposition of $\mathbf{M}$, thus ensuring fast computation speed even when feature vector $\mathbf{f}_i$ has high dimension. To validate its usefulness, we apply our feature graph learning algorithm to the problem of 3D point cloud denoising, resulting in state-of-the-art performance compared to competing schemes in extensive experiments.",2020-03-06,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,https://openalex.org/V168680287,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2020.2978617,2841,2856,68,,1,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2963026027,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2020.2978617,journal-article,2963026027

Thus, renting mining service from cloud providers becomes a reasonable solution, which is called cloud mining. This enables users who want to mine, i.e., miners, to purchase and lease an amount of hashing power from the cloud/edge providers without any hassle of managing the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the interactions among the cloud/edge providers and miners in blockchain using a multi-leader multi-follower game-theoretic approach, in order to support proof-of-work based blockchains application. Due to the inherent complexity of the formulated game, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to investigate the optimum solution.

However, there is a need for long-term data (over centennial or millennial timescales) to better understand natural community dynamics and the processes that govern the observed trends. Chironomids (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are often the most abundant insects in lake ecosystems, sensitive to environmental change, and, because their larval exoskeleton head capsules preserve well in lake sediments, they provide a unique record of insect community dynamics through time. Here, we provide the results of a metadata analysis of chironomid diversity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. First, we analyse spatial trends in chironomid diversity using Northern Hemispheric data sets overall consisting of 837 lakes. Our results indicate that in most of our data sets, summer temperature (Tjul) is strongly associated with spatial trends in modern-day chironomid diversity. We observe a strong increase in chironomid alpha diversity with increasing Tjul in regions with present-day Tjul between 2.5 and 14°C. In some areas with Tjul > 14°C, chironomid diversity stabilizes or declines. Second, we demonstrate that the direction and amplitude of change in alpha diversity in a compilation of subfossil chironomid records spanning the last glacial–interglacial transition (~15,000–11,000 years ago) are similar to those observed in our modern data. A compilation of Holocene records shows that during phases when the amplitude of temperature change was small, site-specific factors had a greater influence on the chironomid fauna obscuring the chironomid diversity–temperature relationship. Our results imply expected overall chironomid diversity increases in colder regions such as the Arctic under sustained global warming, but with complex and not necessarily predictable responses for individual sites.",2020-03-01,Global Change Biology,https://openalex.org/V74970393,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14862,1155,1169,26,3,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980224233,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14862,journal-article,2980224233

The performance of these models relies on the selection of appropriate inputs. However, Input Variable Selection (IVS) is typically performed using expert knowledge or simple linear methods. This research compares and evaluates four IVS methods including two model-free methods: partial correlation (PC), partial mutual information (PMI), and two novel model-based methods: an improved input omission (IO), and improved combined neural pathway strength (CNPS). A comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy for multiple IVS methods has not been published in literature before. Each method is used for daily and hourly lead times in the Bow and Don Rivers (both in Canada), respectively. These watersheds represent different hydrological systems and were selected to highlight the performance of the IVS methods under differing conditions. This research determines that the proposed CNPS produces the strongest performing ANNs based on the robustness of the inputs selected, comparison to other IVS methods, and models developed without IVS. Additionally, this research demonstrates that standard termination criteria do not reliably identify the optimum number of inputs for the ANNs and using a model-based optimization of inputs is recommended. As a result, it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic approach, where each input selection is informed by an IVS-based input ranking, rather than a predefined termination criterion. Lastly, this research demonstrates that input usefulness is not binary concept; the correct number of selected inputs is dependant on the desired model complexity, instead of an arbitrarily selected IVS termination criteria.",2020-04-01,Journal of Hydrology,https://openalex.org/V55737203,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124299,124299,124299,583,,0,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984709157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124299,journal-article,2984709157

In fact, a number of regulatory proteins have emerged as important players in skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and many of these proteins share key attributes with PGC-1α. In an effort to move past the simplistic notion of a “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis, we highlight the regulatory mechanisms by which nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ), PPARβ, and leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRP130) may contribute to the control of skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. We also present evidence supporting/refuting the ability of sulforaphane, quercetin, and epicatechin to promote skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and their potential to augment mitochondrial training adaptations. Targeted activation of specific pathways by these compounds may allow for greater mechanistic insight into the molecular pathways controlling mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle. Dietary activation of mitochondrial biogenesis may also be useful in clinical populations with basal reductions in mitochondrial protein content, enzyme activities, and/or respiratory function as well as individuals who exhibit a blunted skeletal muscle responsiveness to contractile activity. Novelty The existence of redundant pathways leading to mitochondrial biogenesis refutes the simplistic notion of a “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Although intimidation can beget compliance, hierarchical relationships based on dominance are relatively less stable. Here, I consider the costs and benefits of each form of hierarchical structure for high-ranking and low-ranking individuals, and propose that humans have evolved a tolerance for stratification based on prestige and a resistance towards coercive dominance.

The central theme of invisibility emerged, which encompassed and interconnected the three subthemes: (a) gendered stereotyping, (b) spotlighting girls, and (c) gender surveillance and policing. Gendered and sexualized bullying and cyberbullying were found to be part of a socialization process wherein girls come to expect gender-based aggression, violence, and inequality in their lives.

Carbon-based microelectrodes are very attractive for applications in MSCs, however, their potential window, porous structure and capacitance need to be enhanced and optimized. Herein, we report a pyrolyzed carbon/vanadium disulfide nanosheets (C/VS2) microelectrode based MSC by modern micromachining photolithography and pyrolysis process. For this C/VS2 composite microelectrode, carbon and VS2 contribute synergistically with gel electrolyte and an improved volumetric capacitance with wide potential window is obtained. The fabricated MSC demonstrates a high specific volumetric capacitance of 86.4 F cm−3, a high energy and a power densities of 15.6 mWh·cm−3 and 2.88 W cm−3, respectively with an extended potential window (0–1.2 V). In addition, it shows an excellent cycling behavior, retaining 97.7% capacitance after 10,000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 500 mV s−1. This proposed approach provides a highly promising strategy of fabricating high-performance energy storage devices for miniaturized electronics.",2020-05-15,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,https://openalex.org/V67716761,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.151769,151769,151769,823,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968881091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.151769,journal-article,2968881091

However, there is a dearth of research on the impact of discrimination on the psychological functioning of LGBTQ+ individuals who have experienced trauma. The current study seeks to remedy this gap. It was hypothesized that: (1) LGBTQ+ adults who perceived their experience of trauma as related to LGBTQ+ based discrimination would have greater attachment insecurity, emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, and dissociative symptoms; (2) experiences of LGBTQ+ based discrimination would be associated with greater attachment insecurity, emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, and dissociative symptoms; (3) transgender congruence (i.e., the extent to which one feels authentic and comfortable with their gender identity and appearance) would be negatively associated with attachment insecurity, emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, and dissociative symptoms. Methods: Participants were 157 LGBTQ+ adults who had experienced trauma, and who completed questionnaires on discrimination and psychological functioning. Results: Compared to participants who did not experience their trauma as related to discrimination, those who did were higher in attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms. Biphobia was positively associated with attachment anxiety, emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms. Homophobia was positively associated with emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms. Transphobia was positively associated with PTSD and dissociative symptoms.

This has sparked an increase in long-term assessments of historical collections that provide valuable information about population trends and shifts in distributions. However, museums specimens also contain important ecological information, including rarely measured morphological traits. Trait-based assessments of museums specimens provide additional information on underlying mechanisms of population trends, by tracking changes over time. Here, we used museum specimens of four Bombus species, spanning a timeframe of 125 years to: (i) compare body size of declining and increasing species, (ii) assess intra-specific trends over the last century, and (iii) investigate shifts in geographical distribution over time. We found that declining Bombus species were larger than increasing ones. All four species were smaller in current time than a century ago. Intra-specific size declines were more pronounced for larger-bodied species. With our sampling, declining and increasing species showed an upward shift in elevation, and declining species showed an additional geographic shift in recent times as compared to historic records. Intra-specific body size declines may represent species adaptation to unfavorable environmental conditions, and may be a useful metric to complement traditional species vulnerability assessments. We highlight the utility of incorporating trait-based assessments into future studies investigating species declines.",2020-02-01,Biodiversity and Conservation,https://openalex.org/V5043789,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01893-7,451,467,29,2,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984645489,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01893-7,journal-article,2984645489

Imperfection in the acquisition process means that point clouds are often corrupted with noise. Building on recent advances in graph signal processing, we design local algorithms for 3D point cloud denoising. Specifically, we design a signal-dependent feature graph Laplacian regularizer (SDFGLR) that assumes surface normals computed from point coordinates are piecewise smooth with respect to a signal-dependent graph Laplacian matrix. Using SDFGLR as a signal prior, we formulate an optimization problem with a general 'p-norm fidelity term that can explicitly remove only two types of additive noise: small but non-sparse noise like Gaussian (using ' fidelity term) and large but sparser noise like Laplacian (using ' fidelity term). To establish a linear relationship between normals and 3D point coordinates, we first perform bipartite graph approximation to divide the point cloud into two disjoint node sets (red and blue). We then optimize the red and blue nodes' coordinates alternately. For '2-norm fidelity term, we iteratively solve an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, efficiently computed using conjugate gradient with a bounded condition number to ensure numerical stability. For '1-norm fidelity term, we iteratively minimize an '1-'2 cost function using accelerated proximal gradient (APG), where a good step size is chosen via Lipschitz continuity analysis. Finally, we propose simple mean and median filters for flat patches of a given point cloud to estimate the noise variance given the noise type, which in turn is used to compute a weight parameter trading off the fidelity term and signal prior in the problem formulation.

Many insect populations have been reported to be falling and many species are threatened with extinction. While this is true, the evidence does not support unqualified statements of ‘global insect decline’. Global environmental change does not affect all species equally, and there are clear winners as well as losers from anthropogenic impacts.
 In this special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity, we draw together articles that (i) identify key challenges in robust inference about insect population trends, (ii) present new empirical evidence for declines (and increases) in insect populations, spanning whole communities down to single species, in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and (iii) address the interacting drivers of population change, from empirical studies of environmental correlates, to experimental manipulation of driving mechanisms.
 We argue that the way forward for insect conservation includes more nuanced language and approaches when communicating ecological evidence to peer and public audiences, beyond just a simplistic focus on the insect decline narrative. This will require an expanded portfolio of approaches to promote the value of insects to society, which in turn, should reinforce the social licence to prioritise insect conservation research. This should help us to deliver the rigorous science necessary to document ongoing trends and understand the drivers and mechanisms of population change.

Phenotypes of individuals in caste-based (eusocial) societies are particularly sensitive to developmental processes, and the evolutionary origins of eusociality may be rooted in developmental plasticity of ancestral forms. We used an integrative genomics approach to evaluate the relationships among developmental plasticity, molecular evolution, and social behavior in a bee species (Megalopta genalis) that expresses flexible sociality, and thus provides a window into the factors that may have been important at the evolutionary origins of eusociality. We find that differences in social behavior are derived from genes that also regulate sex differentiation and metamorphosis. Positive selection on social traits is influenced by the function of these genes in development. We further identify evidence that social polyphenisms may become encoded in the genome via genetic changes in regulatory regions, specifically in transcription factor binding sites.

Measurements of atmospheric boundary layer nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were performed in summer 201 inside a city centre road tunnel in Birmingham, United Kingdom. HONO and NOx mixing ratios were strongly correlated with traffic density, with peak levels observed during the early evening rush hour as a result of traffic congestion in the tunnel. A day-time ΔHONO∕ΔNOx ratio of 0.85 % (0.72 % to 1.01 %, 9 % confidence interval) was calculated using reduced major axis regression for the overall fleet average (comprising 5 % diesel-fuelled vehicles). A comparison with previous tunnel studies and analysis on the composition of the fleet suggest that goods vehicles have a large impact on the overall HONO vehicle emissions; however, new technologies aimed at reducing exhaust emissions, particularly for diesel vehicles, may have reduced the overall direct HONO emission in the UK. This result suggests that in order to accurately represent urban atmospheric emissions and the OH radical budget, fleet-weighted HONO∕NOx ratios may better quantify HONO vehicle emissions in models, compared with the use of a single emissions ratio for all vehicles. The contribution of the direct vehicular source of HONO to total ambient HONO concentrations is also investigated and results show that, in areas with high traffic density, vehicle exhaust emissions are likely to be the dominant HONO source to the boundary layer.",2020-05-05,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,https://openalex.org/V162708223,,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-5231-2020,5231,5248,20,9,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994253361,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-5231-2020,journal-article,2994253361

Especially vulnerable are youth who have been the victim of high-impact trauma or chronic abuse and neglect. Speciﬁcally, the posttraumatic stress symptomatology that is often associated with experiences of abuse and neglect may impair the ability of youth to cope during this developmental period.

Part of such intervention includes violence prevention in families and in teen dating relationships, as well as directly addressing posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. This critical developmental period of adolescence presents community workers with an opportunity to intervene and guide the development of these youth, building upon resiliency factors, such as areas of individual mastery and empowerment and participation within the community. Aboriginal youth with a history of maltreatment present a special case for community workers. These youth have been subjected to intense acculturation pressures that do not exist for other adolescent populations, which create unique problems during their transition to adulthood.

To date, no data on human intact living muscle fibres have been described. We manually dissected intact single fibres from human intercostal muscle and simultaneously measured force and myoplasmic free [Ca2+ ] at physiological temperature. Based on their fatigue resistance, two distinct groups of fibres were distinguished: fatigue sensitive and fatigue resistant. Force depression in fatigue and during recovery was due to impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in both groups of fibres. Acidification did not affect force production in unfatigued fibres and did not affect fatigue development in fatigue-resistant fibres. The current study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of fatigue in human intercostal muscle. Abstract Changes in intracellular Ca2+ handling of individual skeletal muscle fibres cause a force depression following physical activity and are also implicated in disease-related loss of function. The relation of intracellular Ca2+ handling with muscle force production and fatigue tolerance is best studied in intact living single fibres that allow continuous measurements of force and myoplasmic free [Ca2+ ] during repeated contractions. To this end, manual dissections of human intercostal muscle biopsies were performed to isolate intact single fibres. Based on the ability to maintain tetanic force at >40% of the initial value during 500 fatiguing contractions, fibres were classified as either fatigue sensitive or fatigue resistant. Following fatigue all fibres demonstrated a marked reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, while myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity was either unaltered or increased. In unfatigued fibres, acidosis caused a reduction in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity that was offset by increased tetanic myoplasmic free [Ca2+ ] so that force remained unaffected. Acidification did not affect the fatigue tolerance of fatigue-resistant fibres, whereas uncertainties remain whether or not fatigue-sensitive fibres were affected. Following fatigue, a prolonged force depression at preferentially low-frequency stimulation was evident in fatigue-sensitive fibres and this was caused exclusively by an impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. We conclude that impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release is the predominant mechanism of force depression both in the development of, and recovery from, fatigue in human intercostal muscle.",2020-02-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279090,773,787,598,4,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994410512,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279090,journal-article,2994410512

Apart from this canonical role, it is also integral for ROS production, fatty acid metabolism and epigenetic remodeling. Recently, a role for the mitochondria in effecting stem cell fate decisions has gained considerable interest. This is important for skeletal muscle, which exhibits a remarkable property for regeneration following injury, owing to satellite cells (SCs), the adult myogenic stem cells. Mitochondrial function is associated with maintaining and dictating SC fates, linked to metabolic programming during quiescence, activation, self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Notably, mitochondrial adaptation might take place to alter SC fates and function in the presence of different environmental cues.

The ambiguity of the kinematic information available from the avatars was systematically manipulated using linear morphing between genuine and disguised throws. In a perceptual classification task, trained novice observers (N = 23) were asked to classify as quickly and accurately as possible whether observed throws were either genuine or disguised. In addition, information about the performer’s action preferences was also systematically manipulated by explicitly informing participants about the performer’s AP to disguise their throw (25%, 50%, and 75%). Results Participants’ response behavior showed that observers relied more heavily on the probabilistic information when the kinematics were ambiguous.

The relationship between changes in citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity and the protein content of Nrf2, heme oxygenase  (HO-1), NRF-1, and TFAM was also investigated following  weeks of Tabata in a separate group of males (n = 21).Nrf2, NRF-1, and HO-1 mRNA expression increased after acute exercise (p < 0.05), whereas the increase in superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) mRNA expression approached significance (p = 0.08).

These beams formed part of the superstructure of a newly-constructed railway bridge in Staffordshire, U.K. Two types of prestressed concrete beams were monitored, two TY7 internal beams and two TYE7 edge beams. Both distributed and discrete fibre optic sensor (FOS) systems were used to measure strain and temperature for the first two and a half years since the beams were cast. Prestress loss mechanisms were investigated in detail including immediate prestress losses due to elastic shortening of concrete and time-dependent prestress losses due to steel relaxation, concrete shrinkage and creep. Prestress loss predictions were calculated using both European and American standards, which were then compared with measured prestress losses. Both simplified and advanced time-step methods were used to provide more refined loss predictions by taking into account the interrelationships between various prestress loss mechanisms and the total prestress force at the time of interest. To provide better interpretation of the monitoring measurements, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of various input parameter uncertainties on prestress loss predictions. It was found that (i) time-step methods produced prestress loss estimates that were lower compared with the simplified method; and (ii) code estimates of prestress losses using measured material properties gave reasonable agreement with the field measurements. As structurally-integrated FOS systems are becoming more commonplace and hold great potential, it is envisaged that they enable better understanding of field performance and thus facilitate data-informed asset management.",2020-06-30,Construction and Building Materials,https://openalex.org/V29980478,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118518,118518,118518,247,,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008141463,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118518,journal-article,3008141463

In this study, matched asymptotic expansions are used to systematically reduce a thermo-electrochemical model of a lithium-ion battery based on volume averaging the electrode microstructure. In the cases with a constant or oscillating applied current, explicit asymptotic solutions of the full model can be obtained. In the case with a constant cell potential, the reduced model comprises a low-order differential-algebraic system. The asymptotic and numerical solutions of the volume-averaged model are compared with the numerical solutions of a thermal pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, which treats the electrode as a collection of spherical particles. Excellent agreement is found between the models at (dis)charge rates up to 2C, and reasonable agreement is found at 4C. Homogenization is then used to derive a thermal model of a battery comprising several connected lithium-ion cells. We derive a closed-form solution to the homogenized model when the effective Biot number is small, which corresponds to a spatially uniform battery temperature. By comparing simulation times, we show that the asymptotically reduced and homogenized models provide substantial computational savings compared with the full numerical simulations, thereby making them ideal for use in onboard thermal management systems.

We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions.In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0. two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost  days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.1 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.2 between March 13th to 22nd.

In this work, we provide a simple analytic relation for the lifetime of the merger remnant as function of the initial mass of the neutron stars. This relation results from a joint fit of data from observational evidence and from various numerical simulations.

About 20% of all femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are non-displaced or valgus impacted, for which internal fixation with the cannulated screws system (CSS) is indicated.The aim of this study was to identify predictors of early failure of CSS.Patients with non-displaced FNFs (Garden type I and II) treated operatively using the CSS were enrolled. Their characteristics, Pauwels angle, and posterior tilt were assessed and related with outcomes. The primary outcome was fixation failure within  months.259 patients were included with a mean age of 81.44 years. Most patients were female with ASA 3. The majority of fractures were classified as Garden I and Pauwels I. On average, Pauwels angle was 27°, while posterior tilt was 12°. A linear correlation between Pauwels angle and posterior tilt was found; the failure rate was 9.7%. Using the adjusted Cox competing risk regression analysis, posterior tilt was found to be independently associated with failure rate (sub-distribution hazard ratio or SHR 1.14 [95% CI 1.05-1.24], p = 0.0020).

We consider line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions in both the data loading and delivering links and model them with the Rician and Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. We derive tractable approximations for the derived SNR outage results and demonstrate their application in optimizing the distance that a UAV should travel in order to balance the energy-coverage trade-offs. We formulate two different optimization problems and convexify them to solve for the optimal ferrying distance, i.e. (i) outage-constrained energy minimization and (ii) energy-constrained SNR outage minimization. Closed-form optimal solutions are obtained for the second problem. In addition, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem in order to minimize SNR outage and energy consumption with desired SNR outage probability constraints. The objective function is then reformulated using difference of convex functions (DC) and solved using a DC algorithm.

Grounded in the perspective of pragmatist phenomenology, we assert the need for distinguishing between persons and actors, and the value of integrating the person into institutional analysis. We conceive of persons as humans with a reflective capacity and sense of self, who engage with multiple institutions through the performance of institutional roles. People may acquire actorhood by temporarily aligning their self with what is expected from a particular actor‐role in an institutional order.

However, it remains open whether forward models take the identity of a moving body part into account when predicting the sensory consequences of an action. In the current study, fMRI was used to investigate the neural correlates of active and passive hand movements during which participants saw either an on-line display of their own hand or someone else's hand moving in accordance with their movement. Participants had to detect delays (0-417 ms) between their movement and the displays. Analyses revealed reduced activation in sensory areas and higher delay detection thresholds for active versus passive movements. Furthermore, there was increased activation in the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the middle temporal gyrus when someone else's hand was seen. Most importantly, in posterior parietal (angular gyrus and precuneus), frontal (middle, superior, and medial frontal gyrus), and temporal (middle temporal gyrus) regions, suppression for actively versus passively generated feedback was stronger when participants were viewing their own compared to someone else's hand.

Previous works employ an unbiased least-squares (LS) signal reconstruction scheme and select samples via expensive extreme eigenvector computation. Instead, we assume a biased graph Laplacian regularization (GLR) based scheme that solves a system of linear equations for reconstruction. We then choose samples to minimize the condition number of the coefficient matrix---specifically, maximize the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$. Circumventing explicit eigenvalue computation, we maximize instead the lower bound of $\lambda_{\min}$, designated by the smallest left-end of all Gershgorin discs of the matrix. To achieve this efficiently, we first convert the optimization to a dual problem, where we minimize the number of samples needed to align all Gershgorin disc left-ends at a chosen lower-bound target $T$. Algebraically, the dual problem amounts to optimizing two disc operations: i) shifting of disc centers due to sampling, and ii) scaling of disc radii due to a similarity transformation of the matrix. We further reinterpret the dual as an intuitive disc coverage problem bearing strong resemblance to the famous NP-hard set cover (SC) problem. The reinterpretation enables us to derive a fast approximation scheme from a known SC error-bounded approximation algorithm. We find an appropriate target $T$ efficiently via binary search.

Among those challenges, the lack of appropriate simulation tools to model, design, and optimize BEB fleet systems is the most salient. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new mathematical formulation to model BEB fleet systems. The model considers the operational requirements of public bus transit systems and the energy consumption characteristics of BEBs. The proposed transit model is then integrated with the power distribution system model to develop an integrated utility-transit problem formulation for the optimal design of BEB systems. The formulated optimization problem aims at determining the optimal configuration parameters of BEB fleet systems that include the bus battery capacity, chargers rated power, and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. The developed utility-transit model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and is solved using the Basic Open-Source Nonlinear Mixed INteger Programming (BONMIN) optimization solver.

It is mainly due to the presence of limited active adsorption sites and low surface area that governs an ineffective adsorption potential of the sand material. Herein, graphitized sand was synthesized to tackle the above limitations using two sugar solution sources: a) brewery effluent (as a low-cost solution) (GS1) and; b) sucrose solution (GS2). GS1 showed 68%, 60%, and 99% higher maximum adsorption constant (qmax) for divalent metal ions: iron, copper, and manganese, respectively as compared to raw sand (RS). Coating of MnO2 over the graphitized sand (GSMs: GS1M and GS2M) further helped in Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) removal (3%-9%) when inoculated with MC-LR-degraders, but was not as effective in removing metals, organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to just graphitized sand (GS1 or GS2). Inoculating G and GSMs (for both sugar sources) not only helped in higher MC-LR removal (10%-15% more) but also enhanced the removal of other water contaminants including metals, organic nitrogen, and carbon. GS1 showed 20% and 50% more MC-LR removal than the sand material when tested at a low and high initial concentration of MC-LR ( µg/L and 5 µg/L). The highest breakthrough period was obtained for GS1 filter using  mg/L Rhodamine-B dye, which was 1 times (4 min) more than the raw sand filter and almost 2.5 times (second best, 2 min) than GS1M. After three cycles of regeneration and reuse of GS1 filter, a decrease of just 14% in saturation adsorption capacity indicated its high reusability aspects.",2020-02-10,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135052,135052,135052,703,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2986748288,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135052,journal-article,2986748288

Thelytoky has unleashed new selective pressures and the evolution of traits such as social parasitism, invasiveness, and social cancer. Thelytoky arises from an abnormal meiosis that results in the fusion of two maternal pronuclei, restoring diploidy in newly laid eggs. The genetic basis underlying thelytoky is disputed. To resolve this controversy, we generated a backcross between thelytokous A. m. capensis and non-thelytokous A. m. scutellata from the neighboring population and looked for evidence of genetic markers that co-segregated with thelytokous reproduction in 49 backcross females. We found that markers associated with the gene GB45239 on chromosome 11, including non-synonymous variants, showed consistent co-segregation with thelytoky, whereas no other region did so. Alleles associated with thelytoky were present in all A. m. capensis genomes examined but were absent from all other honeybees worldwide including A. m. scutellata. GB45239 is derived in A. m. capensis and has a putative role in chromosome segregation. It is expressed in ovaries and is downregulated in thelytokous bees, likely because of polymorphisms in the promoter region.

It has been closely linked to childhood trauma and reported by individuals presenting with other trauma-related conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation, and interpersonal problems (Powers, Etkin, Gyurak, Bradley, & Jovanovic, 2015). Addressing the emotional deficits associated with alexithymia is fundamental to resolving issues of childhood trauma and, therefore, is at the core of many trauma therapy models (e.g., Cloitre, Koenen, Cohen, & Han, 2002). The current study aims to build upon this foundation by examining the role of alexithymia in the improvements of trauma-specific difficulties prior to and following trauma therapy among treatment-seeking women with histories of childhood abuse.Data were collected from 16 participants attending Women Recovering from Abuse Program (WRAP), an 8-week, Stage I, day treatment program using primarily group therapy for women with histories of severe childhood trauma. Participants' level of alexithymia, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms, and interpersonal difficulties were assessed at three time points.Significant positive relationships were found between improvements in alexithymia and improvements on all trauma-specific outcomes over the course of treatment (e.g., baseline to posttreatment) and between distinct stages of WRAP.These findings underscore the role of alexithymia in trauma therapy, and the need to properly attend to the deficits and issues related to alexithymia at initial stages of therapy with survivors of childhood abuse in order to facilitate improvements in trauma-specific symptoms.

Conventional and deep learning-based compression algorithms focus on minimizing image fidelity errors in the nonlinear standard RGB (sRGB) color space. However, for many computer vision tasks, the sensor's linear raw-RGB image is desirable. Recent work has shown that the original raw-RGB image can be reconstructed using only small amounts of metadata embedded inside the JPEG image [1]. However, [1] relied on the conventional JPEG encoding that is unaware of the raw-RGB reconstruction task. In this paper, we examine the ability of deep image compressors to be ""aware"" of the additional objective of raw reconstruction. Towards this goal, we describe a general framework that enables deep networks targeting image compression to jointly consider both image fidelity errors and raw reconstruction errors. We describe this approach in two scenarios: (1) the network is trained from scratch using our proposed joint loss, and (2) a network originally trained only for sRGB fidelity loss is later fine-tuned to incorporate our raw reconstruction loss. When compared to sRGB fidelity-only compression, our combined loss leads to appreciable improvements in PSNR of the raw reconstruction with only minor impact on sRGB fidelity as measured by MS-SSIM.",2020-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,https://openalex.org/V199944782,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2019.2903062,1013,1019,42,4,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2919080262,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2019.2903062,journal-article,2919080262

There are several methods and manufacturing technologies that are used to alter surface morphologies, such as machining, surface coating, metal powder sintering, photolithography, and chemical processing, which create varied topologies at various length scales. However, some of these techniques are expensive, difficult to manufacture, limited to simple structures, or degrade over time. In the present study, additive manufacturing (AM) is utilized to produce low-cost, porous polymer fixtures that are designed to alter bubble dynamics and improve the pool boiling heat transfer characteristics from flat copper surfaces. The fixtures examined here consist of a uniform pattern of square cells. An open-source fused filament fabrication 3D printer was used to manufacture the fixtures from PLA, and they were attached mechanically to the boiling surface. The wickability of the printed porous samples was investigated using the rate-of-rise method, which showed that printing build orientation can affect their capillary pressure. The boiling experiments were performed under saturated conditions using deionized water as the working fluid at a pressure of 1 atm. Using fixtures with a small unit cell size, we were able to control the nucleation locations and increase the boiling heat transfer coefficient at low heat fluxes by approximately 80%. However, this did not have a significant effect on critical heat flux (CHF). This was attributed to the presence of a low-conductivity structure covering part of the boiling surface which caused the heat to preferentially flow to the bare regions of the surface and initiated nucleation earlier, even at low heat fluxes. It was also found that increasing the unit cell size was not beneficial at the low heat fluxes; however, it did enhance the CHF by approximately 28% compared with the bare surface.",2020-06-01,Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science,https://openalex.org/V130017051,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2020.110056,110056,110056,114,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001265492,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2020.110056,journal-article,3001265492

Maternal mental health may be particularly challenged in Rwanda because of the prevalence of risk factors such as poverty, low education levels, negative life events and marital problems. However, there are limited data about perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms in Rwanda. This study thus aimed to explore the prevalence of symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety in Rwanda, and factors associated with them. Methods A sample of 16 women in the perinatal period (second and third trimester of pregnancy, up to 1 year postnatal) were interviewed individually over 1 month in October 2013. Women were interviewed at  of 1 health centres in the Eastern Province or the affiliated district hospital. Participants answered socio-demographic questions and scales measuring symptoms of perinatal depression (EPDS: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety (SAS: Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale). Results Among women in the antenatal period ( N = 85), 37.6% had symptoms indicating possible depression (EPDS ≥10) and 28.2% had symptoms associated with clinical levels of anxiety (SAS &gt; 45). Among women within the postnatal period ( N = 77), 63.6% had symptoms of possible depression, whereas 48,1% had symptoms of probable anxiety. Logistic regression showed that symptoms of postnatal depression were higher for respondents who had four or more living children relative to those having their first child (Odds Ratio: 0.07, C.I. = 0.01–0.42), and for those with a poor relationship with their partner (Odds Ratio: .09, C.I. =0.03–0.25). Any lifetime exposure to stressful events was the only predictor of symptoms of postnatal anxiety (Odds Ratio = 0.20, C.I. = 0.09–0.44).

The data can be used to help better understand bumble bee biology and aid in their conservation. Yet for community science programs like this to be successful and sustainable, it is important to understand the participant demographics, what motivates them, and the outcomes of their participation, as well as areas that are working well or could be improved. It is also important to understand who verifies the submissions, who uses the data and their views on the program. Of the surveyed users, most participate to contribute to scientific data collection (88%), because of a worry about bees and a desire to help save them (80%), to learn more about species in their property (63%) or region (56%), and because of a personal interest (59%). About 77% report increased awareness of species diversity, while 84% report improvement in their identification skills. We found that 81% had at least one college or university degree. There were more respondents from suburban and rural areas than urban areas, but area did not affect numbers of submissions. While half were between 4 and 6 years of age, age did not influence motivation or number of submissions. Respondents were happy with the program, particularly the website resources, the contribution to knowledge and conservation efforts, the educational values, and the ability to get identifications. Areas for improvement included app and website functionality, faster and more detailed feedback, localized resources, and more communication. Most respondents participate rarely and have submitted fewer than ten records, although about five percent are super users who participate often and submit more than fifty records. Suggested improvements to the program may increase this participation rate. Indeed, increased recruitment and retention of users in general is important, and advertising should promote the outcomes of participation. Fifteen experts responded to a separate survey and were favorable of the program although there were suggestions on how to improve the verification process and the quality of the submitted data. Suggested research questions that could be asked or answered from the data included filling knowledge gaps (species diversity, ranges, habitat, phenology, floral associations, etc.), supporting species status assessments, effecting policy and legislation, encouraging habitat restoration and management efforts, and guiding further research.

The problem is solved with the aid of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) and bounded mean oscillation martingales. An efficient strategy and an efficient frontier are obtained and represented by unique solutions to several relevant BSDEs. We show that the optimal capital structure can be achieved when the initial asset value is expressed by a linear combination of the initial liability and the expected surplus.

On each block-divided sub-domain, we take three steps to solve the coupled nonlinear system of water-head equation and multicomponent concentration equations in each time interval. The interface Darcy's velocity and the interface global concentration fluxes are first predicted by the semi-implicit flux schemes, while the solutions of water-head and multicomponent concentrations, Darcy's velocity and global concentration fluxes in the interiors of sub-domains are computed by one-directional splitting implicit solution-flux coupled schemes on staggered meshes, and finally the interface Darcy velocity and global concentration fluxes are corrected by the interior solutions. The significance of our scheme is that while it keeps the advantages of the non-overlapping domain decomposition and the splitting technique, it preserves mass on the whole domain of domain decompositions. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the excellent performance of our proposed conservative S-DDM approach for computing nonlinear multicomponent contamination flows in groundwater.

Most selection methods are objective fitness-based approaches which will lead to a waste of fitness evaluations. This is because some evaluated but unpromising solutions are discarded without contributing useful search information. We are, thus, motivated to treat the solution selection as a classification procedure, where the selected solutions and discarded solutions belong to different classes. However, another problem is that the difference between ‘promising’ and ‘unpromising’ solutions becomes fuzzy when iterations go on. Therefore, we employ fuzzy classification to predict the categories of solutions by the fuzzy membership function. And then the predicted results are used to assist solution selection to reduce the number of fitness evaluations. Finally, we propose a fuzzy-classification-assisted selection (FCAS) strategy to boost evolutionary optimization. FCAS is experimentally integrated into two state-of-the-art algorithms and studied on three test suites.

To better understand how self-sensing sleepers can be fully utilized within the rail network, a study of their comprehensive performance under controlled conditions must be undertaken. This article presents the results of the full-scale laboratory testing of a self-sensing sleeper supported on ballast. A primary focus of this study was to investigate whether a self-sensing sleeper could also be used to estimate rail seat load, detect cracking, and identify differential ballast settlement. The ultimate capacity and resilience of the embedded fiber Bragg grating sensing system was tested by applying load up until concrete cracking followed by several cyclic load cycles. Through inference of the load versus strain response, the ability of the self-sensing sleeper to detect damage (concrete cracking and loss of ballast support) was evaluated. The experimental results revealed the effectiveness and robustness of the embedded sensing system to continue to provide reliable dynamic strain measurements well beyond the ultimate loading capacity of the prestressed sleeper. Cracking of the top surface of the sleeper was effectively detected by the fiber Bragg grating strain sensors at the mid-span section. After cracking, subsequent load cycles were carried out. During this period, the bottom fiber Bragg grating measurements captured the effects of differential ballast settlement under the rail seats. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model was developed to simulate the experimental test setup and to investigate the relation between fiber Bragg grating sensor measurements and rail track response. The combined experimental and numerical results suggest that a self-sensing sleeper may be deployed on an operational railway to provide reliable and long-term measurements of rail axle load and ballast pressure.",2020-01-01,Structural Health Monitoring-an International Journal,https://openalex.org/V46950560,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1475921719834506,66,85,19,1,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2922069260,https://doi.org/10.1177/1475921719834506,journal-article,2922069260

This study is the first to conduct a comprehensive ophthalmic examination using portable equipment at various homeless shelter locations in an urban population to identify objective ocular pathologies in a randomly selected sample. Methods Ten adult shelters were randomly selected in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and 143 individuals were randomly selected based on their shelter bed numbers at each shelter, in proportion to the shelter's bed capacity. Participants completed a sociodemographic survey and clinical eye examination. Finally, a dilated ocular examination was performed using a portable slit lamp, autorefractor, tonometer, indirect ophthalmoscope, and fundus camera. Results The median age of participants was 53.3 years; 82.5% were male and 17.5% female. The age-standardized prevalence of visual impairment was 27.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.6–35.1) for study participants. Refractive error was present in 48% of participants, 34% with myopia and 11% with hyperopia, and 37.8% (95% CI, 32.2–45.9) of this study population were diagnosed with at least one nonrefractive ocular pathology. Low income and low educational attainment were associated with increased odds of being diagnosed with nonrefractive ocular pathologies. Conclusions A clear health care gap exists between the ophthalmological disease burden of the HMH population and the amount of resources allocated directed toward their needs.

Fire suppression and conversion to agriculture have strongly affected this ecosystem, altering overstory canopies, understory plant communities, and animal populations. Tree thinning to reinstate open canopies can benefit understory plant diversity, but effects on animal communities are less well understood. Moreover, agricultural land‐use legacies can have long‐lasting impacts on plant communities, but their effects on animal communities either alone or through interactions with restoration are unclear. Resolving these impacts is important due to the conservation potential of fire‐suppressed and post‐agricultural longleaf savannas. We evaluated how historical agricultural land use and canopy thinning affect the diversity and abundance of wild bees in longleaf pine savannas. We employed a replicated, large‐scale factorial block experiment in South Carolina, where canopy thinning was applied to longleaf pine savannas that were either post‐agricultural or remnant (no agricultural history). Bees were sampled using elevated bee bowls. In the second growing season after restoration, thinned plots supported a greater bee abundance and bee community richness. Additionally, restored plots had altered wild bee community composition when compared to unthinned plots, indicating that reduction of canopy cover by the thinning treatment best predicted wild bee diversity and composition. Conversely, we found little evidence for differences between sites with or without historical agricultural land use. Some abundant Lasioglossum species were the most sensitive to habitat changes.

While the production of sequence data for such studies has become straightforward, questions remain about how best to analyze and taxonomically characterize sequence data. For many sequence classification approaches, an important component of the workflow involves the curation of reference sequences. Ideally, this involves trimming away extraneous sequence at the  prime and  prime ends of the target marker of interest, as well as the removal of reference sequence duplicates. Here, we present MetaCurator, a software package written in Python, designed for automated reference sequence curation and highly generalizable across markers and study systems. MetaCurator is organized in a modular fashion, so users can implement tools individually in addition to utilizing the automated and flexible MetaCurator parental code. Aside from modules used to organize and format taxonomic lineage data, MetaCurator contains two signature tools. IterRazor utilizes profile hidden Markov models and an iterative search framework to exhaustively identify and extract the precise amplicon marker of interest from available reference sequence data. DerepByTaxonomy then facilitates sequence dereplication using a taxonomically aware approach, removing duplicates only when they belong to the same taxon. This is important for cases of incomplete lineage sorting between species and for highly conserved markers, such as plant rbcL and trnL, which often display no sequence divergence across taxa, even at the genus level.

These native bacterial strains were isolated from the filtration unit of a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Before starting the filter operation, the biofilm-forming ability of MC-degraders was evaluated using a unique experimental set-up. The study showed that the MC-LR removal was enhanced by 38% using S + X filter as compared to the uninoculated filter (control). Except for Bacillus sp., MC-degraders in the form of Arthrobacter ramosus and Sphingomonas sp. enhanced the MC removal potential of the native bacterial strains (X) by 10% and 17%, respectively. The central composite design was used to obtain an optimized input parameter (pH, temperature, initial turbidity and retention time) for the filter operation. Various output parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total coliform, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, MC-LR toxicity and ammonia were analyzed to form a well-generalized model with a desirability index of 0.638. Overall, filter S + X achieved a non-detectable MCs concentration in some cycles and showed an average of >30% DOC and >80% of total coliform removal along with an under-regulated removal of nitrite, nitrate and ammonia. However, MC-LR breakthrough occurred after 8 weeks of filter operation.

In this paper, the problem of IoT service delivery management is studied with the consideration of substitutability, complementarity, and externalities of delivering IoT services due to the diversity of different IoT components in mobile systems. The substitutable IoT services have similar functionalities to serve IoT users, and the IoT users can switch to buy service from any IoT service provider. The complementary IoT services have different functionalities to serve IoT users, and the IoT users may request a bundle of IoT services from multiple IoT service providers as their IoT services can be integrated. Externalities represent the situation in which IoT users in the same system can affect the utilities of each other due to the connections and interference among the IoT users, which leads to the presence of network effect and congestion effect. To analyze the impact of these factors on the performance of IoT systems, a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model is introduced.

DBT is theorized to lead to improved clinical outcomes by enhancing the capacity for emotion regulation, including improvement in skills (e.g., mindfulness and distress tolerance) for managing emotional distress and impulsive behaviors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether improvements in mindfulness and distress tolerance indirectly affect the relationship between DBT skills training and clinical outcomes. The sample consists of 8 patients diagnosed with BPD who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing 20 weeks of DBT-skills group (DBT-S) to an active waitlist control. Mindfulness and distress tolerance were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 20 weeks. BPD symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, and social adjustment were assessed at the end of 20 weeks and combined into a latent variable representing a broad assessment of general psychopathology. Relative to the waitlist control group, improvements in mindfulness and distress tolerance each independently indirectly affected the relationship between DBT-S and posttreatment general psychopathology. Findings suggest that DBT-S exerts its effects on outcomes through improvements in mindfulness and distress tolerance. These findings support the significance of mindfulness and distress tolerance in DBT-S for BPD. Limitations, future directions, and clinical implications are discussed.

Though static pricing is dominant in the actual data market, price intuitively ought to be dynamically changed to yield greater revenue. The critical question is how to design the optimal dynamic pricing scheme, with prospects for maximizing the expected long-term revenue. In this paper, we study the sequential dynamic pricing scheme of a monopoly mobile network operator in the social data market. In the market, the operator, i.e., the seller, individually offers each mobile user, i.e., the buyer, a certain price in multiple time periods sequentially and repeatedly. The proposed scheme exploits the network effects in the mobile users' behaviors that boost the social data demand. Furthermore, due to limited radio resource, the impact of wireless network congestion is taken into account in the pricing scheme. Thereafter, we propose a modified sequential pricing policy in order to ensure social fairness among mobile users in terms of their individual utilities. To gain more insights, we further study a simultaneous dynamic pricing scheme in which the operator offers the data price simultaneously. We analytically demonstrate that the proposed dynamic pricing scheme can help the operator gain greater revenue and users achieve higher total utilities than those of the baseline static pricing scheme. We construct the social graph using Erdös-Rényi (ER) model and the real dataset based social network for performance evaluation. The numerical results corroborate that the dynamics of pricing schemes over static ones can significantly improve the revenue of the operator.",2020-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,https://openalex.org/V63459445,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/twc.2019.2957092,1722,1737,19,3,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996741051,https://doi.org/10.1109/twc.2019.2957092,journal-article,2996741051

The current trial sought to establish whether adding a brief online intervention for unhealthy alcohol use to an online problem gambling intervention would lead to improvements in gambling and drinking among those with both of these concerns.Participants were recruited from across Canada using an advertisement targeting those concerned about their gambling who were interested in online help. No mention of unhealthy alcohol use was made in the advertisement. Participants meeting criteria for problem gambling were randomized to either receive just an online intervention for gambling (G-only) or to receive an online gambling intervention plus a brief personalized feedback intervention for unhealthy alcohol use (G + A). Participants were followed up at 3 and 6 months.A total of 28 participants were recruited for the trial. Follow-up rates were good (80% and 84% at 3 and 6 months). There were significant reductions in gambling (p < .001) across time but no significant differences (p > .05) between those who received either the G-only or G + A interventions. Further, for those with unhealthy alcohol use (41% of the sample), there were no significant reductions in alcohol consumption (p > .05) across time or differences between condition.The addition of a brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use to an online intervention for gambling did not appear to improve either gambling or drinking outcomes among people concerned about their gambling.

Several diuretic hormones are known to increase primary fluid and ion secretion by insect MTs and, in adult female mosquitoes, a calcitonin-related peptide (DH 31 ) called mosquito natriuretic peptide, increases sodium secretion to compensate for the excess salt load acquired during blood-feeding. An endogenous mosquito anti-diuretic hormone was recently described, having potent inhibitory activity against select diuretic hormones, including DH 31 . Herein, we functionally deorphanized, both in vitro and in vivo , a mosquito anti-diuretic hormone receptor ( Aedae ADHr) with expression analysis indicating highest enrichment in the MTs where it is localized within principal cells. Characterization using a heterologous in vitro system demonstrated the receptor was highly sensitive to mosquito CAPA neuropeptides while in vivo , Aedae ADHr knockdown abolished CAPA-induced anti-diuretic control of DH 31 -stimulated MTs. CAPA neuropeptides are produced within a pair of neurosecretory cells in each of the abdominal ganglia, whose axonal projections innervate the abdominal neurohaemal organs, where these neurohormones are released into circulation. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and protein kinase G (PKG) signaling eliminated anti-diuretic activity of CAPA, highlighting the role of the second messenger cGMP and NOS/PKG in this anti-diuretic signaling pathway.",2020-02-04,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58731-y,,,10,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004650032,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58731-y,journal-article,3004650032

Episodic imagining and the discounting of delayed and probabilistic rewards in young and older adults,"Abstract Remembering and imagining specific, personal experiences can help shape our decisions. For example, cues to imagine future events can reduce delay discounting (i.e., increase the subjective value of future rewards). It is not known, however, whether such cues can also modulate other forms of reward discounting, such as probability discounting (i.e., the decrease in the subjective value of a possible reward as the odds against its occurrence increase). In addition, it is unclear whether there are age-related differences in the effects of cueing on either delay or probability discounting. Accordingly, young and older adult participants were administered delay and probability discounting tasks both with and without cues to imagine specific, personally meaningful events. As expected, cued episodic imagining decreased the discounting of delayed rewards. Notably, however, this effect was significantly less pronounced in older adults. In contrast to the effects of cueing on delay discounting, personally relevant event cues had little or no effect on the discounting of probabilistic rewards in either young or older adults; Bayesian analysis revealed compelling support for the null hypothesis that event cues do not modulate the subjective value of probabilistic rewards. In sum, imagining future events appears only to affect decisions involving delayed rewards. Although the cueing effect is smaller in older adults, nevertheless, it likely contributes to how adults of all ages evaluate delayed rewards and thus, it is, in fact, about time.",2020-06-01,Cognition,https://openalex.org/V88198767,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104222,104222,104222,199,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008886956,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104222,journal-article,3008886956

Reciprocal crosses between honey bee subspecies show parent-of-origin effects for reproductive traits, suggesting that males modify the expression of genes related to female function in their female offspring. This effect is likely to be greater in the Cape honey bee (Apis mellifera capensis), because a male's daughters have the unique ability to produce female offspring that can develop into reproductive workers or the next queen without mating. We generated reciprocal crosses between Capensis and another subspecies and used RNA-seq to identify transcripts that are over- or underexpressed in the embryos, depending on the parental origin of the gene. As predicted, 21 genes showed expression bias towards the Capensis father's allele in colonies with a Capensis father, with no such bias in the reciprocal cross. A further six genes showed a consistent bias towards expression of the father's allele across all eight colonies examined, regardless of the direction of the cross.

Recently, studies have uncovered emergence of human interpretable concepts within DCNNs layers trained to identify visual objects and scenes. Here, we asked whether an artificial neural network (with convolutional structure) trained for visual categorization would demonstrate spatial correspondences with human brain regions showing central/peripheral biases. Using representational similarity analysis, we compared activations of convolutional layers of a DCNN trained for object and scene categorization with neural representations in human brain visual regions. Results reveal a brain-like topographical organization in the layers of the DCNN, such that activations of layer-units with central-bias were associated with brain regions with foveal tendencies (e.g. fusiform gyrus), and activations of layer-units with selectivity for image backgrounds were associated with cortical regions showing peripheral preference (e.g. parahippocampal cortex).

However, growing evidence suggests that the dorsal pathway also plays a functional role in object perception. In the current article, we present evidence that the dorsal pathway contributes uniquely to the perception of a range of visuospatial attributes that are not redundant with representations in ventral cortex. We describe how dorsal cortex is recruited automatically during perception, even when no explicit visuomotor response is required. Importantly, we propose that dorsal cortex may selectively process visual attributes that can inform the perception of potential actions on objects and environments, and we consider plausible developmental and cognitive mechanisms that might give rise to these representations. As such, we consider whether naturalistic stimuli, such as real-world solid objects, might engage dorsal cortex more so than simplified or artificial stimuli such as images that do not afford action, and how the use of suboptimal stimuli might limit our understanding of the functional contribution of dorsal cortex to visual perception.",2020-03-01,Open Mind,https://openalex.org/V2488191322,MIT Press,https://doi.org/10.1162/opmi_a_00033,40,56,4,,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039064940,https://doi.org/10.1162/opmi_a_00033,journal-article,3039064940

They occur predominantly in sleep and quiet immobility, and in primates, they also appear during active visual exploration. Typical measures of SWRs in behaving rats include changes in the rate of occurrence, or in the incidence of specific neural ensemble activity contained within the categorical SWR event. Much less is known about the relevance of spatiotemporal SWR features, though they may index underlying activity of specific cell types including ensemble-specific internally generated sequences. Furthermore, changes in SWR features during active exploratory states are unknown. In this study, we recorded hippocampal local-field potentials and single-units during periods of quiescence and as macaques performed a memory-guided visual search task. We observed that (a) ripples during quiescence have greater amplitudes and larger postripple waves (PRW) compared to those in task epochs, and (b) during remembered trials, ripples have larger amplitudes than during forgotten trials, with no change in duration or PRWs. We further found that spiking activity influences SWR features as a function of cell type and ripple timing. As expected, larger ripple amplitudes were associated with putative pyramidal or putative basket interneuron (IN) activity, even when the spikes in question exceed the duration of the ripple. In contrast, the PRW was attenuated with activity from low firing rate cells and enhanced with activity from high firing rate cells, with putative IN spikes during ripples leading to the most prominent PRW peaks. The selective changes in SWR features as a function of time window, cell type, and cognitive/vigilance states suggest that this mesoscopic field event can offer additional information about the local network and animal's state than would be appreciated from SWR event rates alone.",2020-01-01,Hippocampus,https://openalex.org/V55111660,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23046,50,59,30,1,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2898988061,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23046,journal-article,2898988061

The inability to make sense of these products elevates anxiety and leads to negative evaluations. Although scholars have predominantly focused on combating the negative response to extreme incongruity, we propose that extreme incongruity may have implications that extend beyond the category. We base our predictions on the concept of fluid compensation,which suggests that when people struggle to make sense of something, they will nonconsciously reinforce highly accessible schemas in unrelated domains. Four studies confirm that extreme incongruity encourages fluid compensation, such that it elevates preference for dominant brands (study 1), green consumption (studies 2 and 4), and ethnocentric products (study 3). We isolate the causal role of anxiety using moderation tasks and biometric feedback. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compensation has an immediate dampening effect on arousal intensity. Thus, if consumers can compensate before explicitly evaluating an extremely incongruent product, their evaluations tend not to be negative. Taken together, we document that extreme innovations encourage compensation, and in compensating, consumers can become more receptive to extreme innovations.",2020-01-01,Journal of Consumer Psychology,https://openalex.org/V163545350,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1127,77,95,30,1,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2956053547,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1127,journal-article,2956053547

The purpose of this study was to determine if sexual dimorphism exists in skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in people with type  diabetes (T1D). A resting muscle microbiopsy was obtained from women and men with T1D ( n = 10/8, respectively) and without T1D (control; n = 8/7, respectively). High-resolution respirometry and spectrofluorometry were used to measure mitochondrial respiratory function, hydrogen peroxide (mH 2 O 2 ) emission and calcium retention capacity (mCRC) in permeabilized myofiber bundles. The impact of T1D on mitochondrial bioenergetics between sexes was interrogated by comparing the change between women and men with T1D relative to the average values of their respective sex-matched controls (i.e., delta). These aforementioned analyses revealed that men with T1D have increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial complex I sensitivity but reduced complex II sensitivity and capacity in comparison to women with T1D. mH 2 O 2 emission was lower in women compared with men with T1D at the level of complex I (succinate driven), whereas mCRC and mitochondrial protein content remained similar between sexes. In conclusion, women and men with T1D exhibit differential responses in skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics. Although larger cohort studies are certainly required, these early findings nonetheless highlight the importance of considering sex as a variable in the care and treatment of people with T1D (e.g., benefits of different exercise prescriptions).",2020-01-01,American Journal of Physiology-endocrinology and Metabolism,https://openalex.org/V196637695,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00411.2019,E44,E51,318,1,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994017671,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00411.2019,journal-article,2994017671

In this research, we develop a stochastic analytical model for optimal control of communicant autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at smart intersections. We present the automated network fundamental diagram (ANFD) as a macro-level modeling tool for urban networks with smart intersections. In the proposed cooperative control strategy, we make use of the headway between the CAV platoons in each direction for consecutive passage of the platoons in the crossing direction through non-signalized intersections with no delay. For this to happen, the arrival and departure of platoons in crossing directions need to be synchronized. To improve system robustness (synchronization success probability), we allow a marginal gap between arrival and departure of the consecutive platoons in crossing directions to make up for operational error in the synchronization process. We then develop a stochastic traffic model for the smart intersections. Our results show that the effects of increasing the platoon size and the marginal gap length on the network capacity are not always positive. In fact, the capacity can be maximized by optimizing these cooperative control variables. We analytically solve the traffic optimization problem for the platoon size and marginal gap length and derive a closed-form solution for a normal distribution of the operational error. The performance of the network with smart intersections is presented by a stochastic ANFD, derived analytically and verified numerically using the results of a simulation model.

As their energies are conservative, it is of importance to develop energy preserving finite difference method (EP-FDM) for these systems of nonlinear wave equations. However, the energy preserving finite difference methods (EP-FDMs) for one-dimensional single sine-Gordon equation and one-dimensional single Klein-Gordon equation, can not directly be generalized to solve the systems of coupled SG or coupled KG equations, and the theoretical analysis technique used for 1D single SG equation or for 1D single KG equation is not suitable for the analysis of high dimensional problems. In this paper, we develop and analyze two kinds of energy preserving FDMs for the systems of coupled SG equations or coupled KG equations in two dimensions. One proposed scheme is a two-level scheme and the other is a three-level scheme. We prove the schemes to satisfy the energy conservations in the discrete forms. By using the fixed point theorem, it is shown that they are solvable. Also, it is further proved that they have the second order convergence rate in both time and space steps.

The blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila) is a federally endangered species that, despite protection, remains in extremely arid, hot areas and may be at risk of extirpation due to climate change. We collected data on the field-active body temperatures, preferred body temperatures and upper thermal tolerance of G. sila. We then described available thermal habitat using biophysical models, which allowed us to (i) describe patterns in lizard body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures and lizard microhabitat use; (ii) quantify the lizards’ thermoregulatory accuracy; (iii) calculate the number of hours they are currently thermally restricted in microhabitat use; (iv) project how the number of restricted hours will change in the future as ambient temperatures rise; and (v) assess the importance of giant kangaroo rat burrows and shade-providing shrubs in the current and projected future thermal ecology of G. sila. Lizards maintained fairly consistent daytime body temperatures over the course of the active season, and use of burrows and shrubs increased as the season progressed and ambient temperatures rose. During the hottest part of the year, lizards shuttled among kangaroo rat burrows, shrubs, and open habitat to maintain body temperatures below their upper thermal tolerance, but, occasionally, higher than their preferred body temperature range. Lizards are restricted from staying in the open habitat for 75% of daylight hours and are forced to seek refuge under shrubs or burrows to avoid surpassing their upper thermal threshold.

Once engaged, these nucleotide-sensing receptors use distinct signaling modules for the rapid and robust activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, and the IKK-related kinases IKKε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), leading to the subsequent activation of the activator protein 1 (AP1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factors, respectively. They, in turn, induce immunomodulatory genes, allowing for a rapid antiviral cellular response. Unlike the MAPKs, the IKK complex and the IKK-related kinases, ubiquitously expressed glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) α and β isoforms are active in unstimulated resting cells and are involved in the constitutive turnover of β-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and lineage commitment. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated the regulatory roles of both GSK-3 and β-catenin in type I IFN antiviral innate immune response, particularly affecting the activation of IRF3. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the mechanisms by which GSK-3 and β-catenin control the antiviral innate immune response to RNA and DNA virus infections.",2020-04-07,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040897,897,897,9,4,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015548725,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040897,journal-article,3015548725

The protein and carbohydrate groups consumed two isocaloric post-exercise beverages each containing 0. g.kg- 1 of whey protein (with ~  mg of calcium) or maltodextrin while the control group consumed water. Participants provided a morning, fasted, resting blood sample, then performed an intense swimming trial consisting of a maximal 20 m swim followed by a high intensity interval swimming protocol (5x100m, 5x50m and 5x25m; 1:1 work-to-rest ratio). Following swimming, they consumed their first respective post-exercise beverage, and  h later, they performed a second maximal swim immediately followed by the second beverage. Approximately  h after the second beverage, two post-consumption blood samples were collected at 8 h and 2 h from baseline. Procollagen type 1 intact N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTXI) were measured in serum. The multiples of medians of PINP and CTXI were also used to calculate bone turnover rate and balance.No significant changes were observed in PINP. CTXI increased (+ 11%) at  h in all groups, but then significantly decreased (- 22%) at 2 h in the protein group only. The protein group also had a significantly higher calculated rate of bone turnover at  h and 2 h compared to baseline, which was not observed in the other groups.These results shed light on the potential importance of protein consumed shortly after intense swimming in promoting positive bone turnover responses up to 2 h following exercise in adolescent athletes.ClinicalTrials.gov PRS; NCT04114045.

Owing to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), secondary infection with one Flavivirus following primary infection with another Flavivirus can result in a significantly larger peak viral load with a much higher risk of severe disease. Although several mathematical models have been developed to quantify the virus dynamics in the primary and secondary infections of DENV, little progress has been made regarding secondary infection of DENV after a primary infection of ZIKV, or DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Here, we address this critical gap by developing compartmental models of virus dynamics. We first fitted the models to published data on dengue viral loads of the primary and secondary infections with the observation that the primary infection reaches its peak much more gradually than the secondary infection. We then quantitatively show that ADE is the key factor determining a sharp increase/decrease of viral load near the peak time in the secondary infection. In comparison, our simulations of DENV and ZIKV co-infection (simultaneous rather than sequential) show that ADE has very limited influence on the peak DENV viral load. This indicates pre-existing immunity to ZIKV is the determinant of a high level of ADE effect. Our numerical simulations show that (i) in the absence of ADE effect, a subsequent co-infection is beneficial to the second virus; and (ii) if ADE is feasible, then a subsequent co-infection can induce greater damage to the host with a higher peak viral load and a much earlier peak time for the second virus, and for the second peak for the first virus.",2020-04-15,Royal Society Open Science,https://openalex.org/V2737558550,The Royal Society,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191749,191749,191749,7,4,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016602307,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191749,journal-article,3016602307

This includes the investigation of how some research issues, such as maltreatment history, personal safety, relationship to primary CPS worker and suicidal ideation, may be cross-informative. It is known that teen risk behaviours cluster together, but it is important to understand the relationships among these variables.

The spacecraft and its ground stations are each equipped with stable hydrogen maser frequency standards, and measurements of the redshifted downlink carrier frequencies were obtained at both 8.4 and 1 GHz between 201 and 2017. Over the course of the $\sim$  d orbit, the gravitational redshift between the spacecraft and the ground stations varies between $6.8 \times 10^{-10}$ and $0.6 \times 10^{-10}$. Since the clock offset between the masers is difficult to estimate independently of the gravitational redshift, only the variation of the gravitational redshift is considered for this analysis. We obtain a preliminary estimate of the fractional deviation of the gravitational redshift from prediction of $\epsilon = -0.016 \pm 0.003_{\rm stat} \pm 0.030_{\rm syst}$ with the systematic uncertainty likely being dominated by unmodelled effects including the error in accounting for the non-relativistic Doppler shift. This result is consistent with zero within the uncertainties. For the first time, the gravitational redshift has been probed over such large distances in the vicinity of Earth.

Using secondary data from the NIDA-funded Women and Trauma Study, we demonstrated Common Persons Item Response Theory (IRT) Calibration for calibrating self-reported and clinician-reported PTSD severity scores in a manner similar to the process used to produce equated scores across multiple forms of standardized tests (e.g., SAT, GRE). Under IRT calibration, treatment effect sizes between the CAPS and MPSS-SR did not differ, while with the noncalibrated measures, the CAPS effect size was 85% larger than the MPSS-SR. Further, across the range of a combined CAPS/MPSS-SR gold standard, IRT-calibrated CAPS and MPSS-SR individual scores did not differ; for uncalibrated individual scores, MPSS scores were higher than CAPS scores at higher levels of PTSD severity while the reverse was true at lower levels of severity. The use of IRT calibration approaches for calibrating self-report and clinical interview measures of PTSD will allow treatment researchers to reflect the treatment effect on PTSD as a construct (regardless of reporter) as opposed to being limited to reporting treatment effects that may be discrepant within patients and specific to the particular assessment measure being employed.

Taking seriously Patricia Hill Collins’ (2017) call to analyze “intensified points of convergence” (p. 1464), we analyze the role of social work in perpetuating carceral systems and the tools that feminist social work provides for disrupting them. Using a case analysis of a foster child in Halifax, Canada, who in 2018 was faced with deportation after social workers failed to secure his citizenship status, we argue that a pipeline exists between child protection and a growing “crimmigration” system. The carceral logics of this pipeline not only draw from anti-Black, Islamophobic, and settler colonial histories of oppression, but they also position certain noncitizen families as unassimilable and requiring of state intervention rather than social supports. With this carceral pipeline in mind, we then draw from feminist anticarceral and intersectional approaches to consider a range of resistance strategies.

Behavioral analysis quantified performance accuracy, speed of processing, reversal learning speed, the control of distractor interference, perseveration tendencies, and motivation.We found that the alpha-7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 enhanced the learning speed of feature values but did not modulate how salient distracting information was filtered from ongoing choice processes. In contrast, the selective alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonist ABT-089 did not affect learning speed but reduced distractibility. This dissociation was dose-dependent and evident in the absence of systematic changes in overall performance, reward intake, motivation to perform the task, perseveration tendencies, or reaction times.These results suggest nicotinic sub-receptor specific mechanisms consistent with (1) alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR specific amplification of cholinergic transients in prefrontal cortex linked to enhanced cue detection in light of interferences, and (2) alpha-7 nAChR specific activation prolonging cholinergic transients, which could facilitate subjects to follow-through with newly established attentional strategies when outcome contingencies change.

Here we provide a comprehensive dated phylogeny for Colletes based on Bayesian and maximum likelihood-based analyses of DNA sequence data of six loci: 28S rDNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, elongation factor-1α copy F2, long-wavelength rhodopsin, RNA polymerase II and wingless. In total, our multilocus matrix consists of 482 aligned base pairs for 14 species, including 11 Colletes species plus 3 outgroups (one stenotritid and a diverse array of colletids representing all subfamilies). Overall, analyses of each of the six single-locus datasets resulted in poorly resolved consensus trees with conflicting phylogenetic signal. However, our analyses of the multilocus matrix provided strong support for the monophyly of Colletes and show that it can be subdivided into five major clades. The implications of our phylogenetic results for future attempts at infrageneric classification for the Colletes of the world are discussed. We propose species groups for the Neotropical species of Colletes, the only major biogeographic realm for which no species groups have been proposed to date. Our dating analysis indicated that Colletes diverged from its sister taxon, Hemicotelles Toro and Cabezas, in the early Oligocene and that its extant lineages began diversifying only in the late Oligocene. According to our biogeographic reconstruction, Colletes originated in the Neotropics (most likely within South America) and then spread to the Nearctic very early in its evolutionary history. Geodispersal to the Old World occurred soon after colonization of the Northern Hemisphere. Lastly, the historical biogeography of Colletes is analyzed in light of available geological and palaeoenvironmental data.",2020-05-01,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V96989847,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106750,106750,106750,146,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004856830,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106750,journal-article,3004856830

This study reported on claudin (Cldn) TJ protein transcripts of pre-metamorphic larval and post-metamorphic juvenile sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and the transcriptional response of genes encoding Cldns to changed environmental ion levels. Transcripts encoding Cldn-3b, -4, -5, -10, -14, -18 and -19 were identified, and mRNA expression profiles revealed the organ-specific presence of cldn- and -14, broad expression of cldn-3b, -4, -10, -18 and -19 and spatial differences in the mRNA abundance of cldn-4, -3b and -14 along the ammocoete intestine. Expression profiles were qualitatively similar in ammocoetes and juvenile fishes. Transcript abundance of genes encoding Cldns in osmoregulatory organs (gill, kidney, intestine and skin) was subsequently investigated after exposure of ammocoetes to ion-poor water (IPW) and juveniles to hyperosmotic conditions [60% sea water (SW)]. IPW-acclimated ammocoetes increased mRNA abundance of nearly all cldns in the gill. Simultaneously, cldn-1 abundance increased in the skin, whereas cldn-4, -14 and -18 decreased in the kidney. Ammocoete cldn mRNA abundance in the intestine was altered in a region-specific manner. In contrast, cldn transcript abundance was mostly downregulated in osmoregulatory organs of juvenile fish acclimated to SW  cldn-3b, -1 and -19 in the gill; cldn-3b, -4, -1 and -19 in the skin; cldn-3b in the kidney; and cldn-3b and -1 in the intestine. Data support the idea that Cldn TJ proteins play an important role in the osmoregulatory physiology of pre- and post-metamorphic sea lamprey and that Cldn participation can occur across organs, in an organ-specific manner, as well as differ spatially within organs, which contributes to the regulation of salt and water balance in these fishes.",2020-02-04,Journal of Fish Biology,https://openalex.org/V9351502,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14274,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005433844,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14274,journal-article,3005433844

Exercise interventions provide multiple health benefits to older men on ADT; however, their effect on metabolic biomarkers and BMD remains unclear. Methods A secondary analysis of a phase II randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effect of a six-month moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise program on metabolic biomarkers and BMD in men on ADT. Participants were randomized to three different exercise delivery models: personal training; supervised group exercise; or home-based exercise. Analysis of metabolic biomarkers (lipid profile and glucose) was conducted at baseline, six and twelve months. BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and hip were assessed at baseline and twelve months. Both within- and between-group analyses of change scores adjusted for baseline values were performed. Results Forty-eight men (mean age 69.8y) were enrolled. Baseline values of metabolic biomarkers and BMD were comparable between groups and the three groups were combined for the primary analysis. At six months, no changes in metabolic biomarkers were found; however, at twelve months low-density lipoprotein (+0.28 mmol/L; 95%CI, 0.0 to 0.51) and total cholesterol (+0.31 mmol/L; 95%CI, 0.0 to 0.61) were significantly increased from baseline.

The purpose of this study was to explore how clinicians deliver PCCW, challenges they face, and the strategies they suggest are needed to support PCCW. Methods We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews (25–60 min) with clinicians. Thirty-seven clinicians representing 7 specialties (family physicians, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, obstetricians/gynecologist, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers) who manage depression ( n = 16), cardiovascular disease ( n = 11) and contraceptive counseling ( n = 10), conditions that affect women across the lifespan. We used constant comparative analysis to inductively analyze transcripts, mapped themes to a 6-domain PCC conceptual framework to interpret findings, and complied with qualitative research reporting standards. Results Clinicians said that women don’t always communicate their health concerns and physicians sometimes disregard women’s health concerns, warranting unique PCC approaches.. Clinicians described 3 approaches they used to tailor PCC for women across  PCC domains: foster a healing relationship, exchange information, address emotions/concerns, manage uncertainty, make decisions, and enable self-management. Additional conditions that facilitated PCCW were: privacy, access to female clinicians, accommodating children through onsite facilities, and flexible appointment formats and schedules. Clinicians suggested 7 strategies needed to address barriers of PCCW they identified at the: patient-level (online appointments, transport to health services, use of patient partners to plan and/or deliver services), clinician-level (medical training and continuing professional development in PCC and women’s health), and system-level (funding models for longer appointment times, multidisciplinary teamwork to address all PCC domains). Conclusions Our research revealed numerous strategies that clinicians can use to optimize PCCW, and health care managers and policy-makers can use to support PCCW through programs and policies.

Although interventions targeting emotion regulation show promise, children’s individual treatment responses vary, and it is important to understand the factors that contribute to treatment change. The present study aimed to identify pre-treatment child characteristics and parent psychopathology that predict treatment response in a 10-week manualized cognitive behaviour therapy intervention for children with autism, 8–12 years of age. Exploratory best-subset regression analyses were first carried out to identify the optimal set of predictors. Logistic regressions were then conducted to determine whether these variables predicted reliable improvement. Outcome variables consisted of the lability/negativity and the emotion regulation subscales of the Emotion Regulation Checklist. Predictors included pre-treatment developmental, clinical, and parent psychopathology variables. Analyses revealed that youth who started the treatment with higher verbal reasoning, higher impairment in social motivation, and more anxious parents were more likely to show reliable improvements in emotion regulation. Youth who started the treatment with higher internalizing scores had lower odds of showing reliable improvement. Implications of our findings include facilitation of active involvement, avoidance of complex language, and the provision of additional supports. Further suggestions to inform clinical practice are discussed. Lay abstract Children with autism commonly experience difficulty controlling their emotions. Although existing treatments are successful in teaching critical emotion regulation skills, not all children improve. It is important to identify the factors that influence treatment response to be able to reach more children. This study aimed to identify child and parent characteristics that predict treatment response in a 10-week cognitive behaviour therapy treatment for children with autism, 8–12 years of age, and their parents. We found that youth who started the treatment with higher verbal abilities, who were more anxious in social situations, and had parents who were more anxious, were more likely to improve in learning new emotion regulation skills. We also found that children who had more physical discomforts or complaints before starting the treatment were less likely to improve in their negative expressions of emotion. Our study suggests that it is important for clinicians to promote active involvement and learning by avoiding complex language and to use more visual materials to supplement the learning process, and make sure that sessions are sensitive to the individual needs of participants.",2020-04-03,Autism,https://openalex.org/V1824407,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320909178,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014506030,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320909178,journal-article,3014506030

Early morning saliva and venous blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after exercise from 3 competitive swimmers (1 boys, age 14.3 [1.9] y; 15 men, age 21.7 [3.1] y). Exercise included a swim-bench maximal strength task and an all-out 200-m swim, followed by a high-intensity interval swimming protocol ( × 10 m, 5 × 5 m, and 5 × 2 m). At baseline, fasting testosterone (but not cortisol) concentration was higher in men than boys in serum and saliva ( P &lt; .05). Salivary and serum cortisol increased postexercise, with a greater increase in men compared with boys (men: 226% and 242%; boys: 78% and 64%, respectively; group by time interaction, P &lt; .05).

Serum and salivary cortisol (but not testosterone), preexercise and postexercise values were strongly correlated in both men and boys ( r = .79 and .82, respectively; P &lt; .01). In summary, early morning high-intensity exercise results in a decrease in testosterone in serum, but not saliva, and an increase in cortisol irrespective of the fluid used, in both boys and men. When examining immediate postexercise changes, the lack of correlation in testosterone between saliva and serum suggests that saliva may not be an appropriate fluid to examine changes in testosterone.

This paper demonstrates how such plants should be sized and operated for joint applications, in order to enhance the system rate of return. To that end, a new model is proposed for optimal sizing and scheduling of the LOHC-based generation and storage plants for concurrent services to both the transportation sector and ancillary services market. The ancillary service signals are incorporated into the optimal scheduling model, in order to prepare the LOHC-based plant for the successful contribution to the market.

Unlike the standard DEA model, multiplier-based network DEA models are often highly non-linear and cannot be converted into linear programs. As such, obtaining a non-linear network DEA's global optimal solution is a challenge because it corresponds to a nonconvex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a conic relaxation model that searches for the global optimum to the general multiplier-based network DEA model. We reformulate the general network DEA models and relax the new models into second order cone programming (SOCP) problems. In comparison with linear relaxation models, which is potentially applicable to general network DEA structures, the conic relaxation model guarantees applicability in general network DEA, since McCormick envelopes involved are ensured to be finite. Furthermore, the conic relaxation model avoids unnecessary linear relaxations of some nonlinear constraints. It generates, in a more convenient manner, feasible approximations and tighter upper bounds on the global optimal overall efficiency. Compared with a line-parameter search method that has been applied to solve non-linear network DEA models, the conic relaxation model keeps track of the distances between the optimal overall efficiency and its approximations. As a result, it is able to determine whether a qualified approximation has been achieved or not, with the help of a branch and bound algorithm. Hence, our proposed approach can substantially reduce the computations involved.",2020-01-01,European Journal of Operational Research,https://openalex.org/V103321696,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.07.012,,,,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2960490086,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.07.012,journal-article,2960490086

Blood was obtained at weeks 0, 1, and 12 to measure procollagen-type-I-N-terminal-propeptide (P1NP) and C-terminal-telopeptide (CTX). After outlier treatment, P1NP increased more over time in GY versus PP (p = 0.002; interaction). Both groups decreased CTX over time (p = 0.046; time effect). Following 1 week of training, there was a trend towards a significant increase in CTX in PP with no change in GY (p = 0.062; interaction). P1NP changed more in GY than PP (baseline to week 12; p = 0.029) as did the P1NP/CTX ratio (p = 0.015) indicating a greater increase in formation with GY. Thus, GY added to a high-load, high-impact exercise program positively shifted bone turnover towards increased formation while attenuating resorption. GY could be a plausible postexercise food to support bone health in young adult males. Novelty Greek yogurt, with exercise, increased bone formation in young adult males over 12 weeks. After 1 week of an osteogenic exercise program, Greek yogurt tended to blunt a rise in bone resorption seen with the placebo.

In search of possible explanations for this behavioral competence, we evaluated white matter microstructure and connectivity in eight pediatric epilepsy patients following unilateral cortical resection and 15 age-matched controls. To uncover both local and broader resection-induced effects, we analyzed tractography data using two complementary approaches. First, the microstructural properties were measured in the inferior longitudinal and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the major VOTC association tracts. Group differences were only evident in the ipsilesional, and not in the contralesional, hemisphere, and single-subject analyses revealed that these differences were limited to the site of the resection. Second, graph theory was used to characterize the connectivity of the contralesional occipito-temporal regions. There were no changes to the network properties in patients with left VOTC resections nor in patients with resections outside the VOTC, but altered network efficiency was observed in two cases with right VOTC resections. These results suggest that, in many, although perhaps not all, cases of unilateral VOTC resections in childhood, the white matter profile in the preserved contralesional hemisphere along with residual neural activity might be sufficient for normal visual perception.",2020-02-15,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116345,116345,116345,207,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2986314683,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116345,journal-article,2986314683

Evidence of impaired mitochondrial functions and/or morphology in people with type 1 diabetes across various organ systems. What advances does it highlight? Impairments to mitochondrial functions and morphology may be a primary mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of various complications in people with type 1 diabetes. Abstract We recently made the observation that there are significant alterations to the ultrastructure and functions of mitochondria in skeletal muscle of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). These alterations are proposed to lead to decreased energy production in skeletal muscle during exercise and thus may contribute to the impaired aerobic exercise capacity reported in some people with T1D. This Symposium Review summarizes the evidence that similar alterations also occur in the mitochondria present in organ systems outside skeletal muscle in people with T1D, and that this may contribute to the development and progression of the known complications of T1D, which eventually lead to the reported premature mortality.",2020-04-01,Experimental Physiology,https://openalex.org/V65894173,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088096,565,570,105,4,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995817571,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088096,journal-article,2995817571

The linker histone H1, along with the core histones, is a key component of eukaryotic chromatin. Despite its critical roles in chromatin structure and function and gene regulation, studies regarding the H1 protein-protein interaction networks, particularly outside of Opisthokonts, are limited. The nuclear dimorphic ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila encodes two distinct nucleus-specific linker histones, macronuclear Hho1 and micronuclear Mlh1. We used a comparative proteomics approach to identify the Hho1 and Mlh1 protein-protein interaction networks in Tetrahymena during growth, starvation, and sexual development. Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the Hho1 and Mlh1 proteins revealed a non-overlapping set of co-purifying proteins suggesting that Tetrahymena nucleus-specific linker histones are subject to distinct regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we found that linker histones interact with distinct proteins under the different stages of the Tetrahymena life cycle. Hho1 and Mlh1 co-purified with several Tetrahymena -specific as well as conserved interacting partners involved in chromatin structure and function and other important cellular pathways.

The results demonstrated that whole body Fe content was increased in 14 dpf larvae fed a high Fe diet. Cumulative mortality was also significantly elevated during exposure to the high Fe diet. Using droplet digital PCR, we observed that high Fe-exposed larvae exhibited an increase in mRNA levels of the Fe-storage protein ferritin, which appeared to be associated with the elevated level of whole body Fe content. Further, the results indicated that dietary Fe exposure induced transient changes in the mRNA expression levels of various metal transporters, including the iron transporter dmt1, and the zinc transporters zip8 and zip14.

These striking systems provide key snapshots for dissecting galactic disks and are studied extensively in the local Universe. However, not much is known about distant (z>0.1) collisional rings. Here we present a detailed study of a ring galaxy at a look-back time of 10.8 Gyr (z=2.19). Compared with our Milky Way, this galaxy has a similar stellar mass, but has a stellar half-light radius that is 1.5-2.2 times larger and is forming stars 5 times faster. The large, diffuse stellar light outside the star-forming ring, combined with a radial velocity on the ring and an intruder galaxy nearby, provides evidence for this galaxy hosting a collisional ring. If the ring is secularly evolved, the implied large bar in a giant disk would be inconsistent with the current understanding of the earliest formation of barred spirals. Contrary to previous predictions, this work suggests that massive collisional rings were as rare 1 Gyr ago as they are today.

HCPs noted that being culturally matched with their patients helped them communicate effectively. HCPs also spoke about religious taboos on suicide as being a barrier to having conversations, either because patients did not feel comfortable discussing these issues, or because they perceived that this was not a topic they could bring up. Some HCPs reported that the culture/ethnicity of their patients had no effect on their ability to communicate effectively with them about mental health distress or suicidality. Advancing effective cross-cultural communication is a challenge faced by HCPs.

However, levels of mattering were not linked with help-seeking attitudes or self-stigma for seeking help.

Many consider local content policies (LCPs) as the most appropriate vehicle for such an endeavour. However, the definition of “local” and what type of measures should be employed have been subjected to much debate. There are also several regulatory, political, and industry-specific obstacles to the enactment and enforcement of LCPs. In the case of Zambia, mine suppliers and service providers to the country’s copper mines have sought to ride the recent wave of “resource nationalism” and push for mandatory local procurement, drawing upon measures employed to award public infrastructure contracts. These demands run counter to the designs of traditional donor agencies operating in Zambia, who adopted a depoliticised, technocratic approach and espoused a voluntary, business friendly LCP. This paper criticizes the donor agencies’ recommendations by arguing that: (1) mandatory local content measures are necessary to remedy the damages inflicted on Zambia’s copper mining supply chain by economic liberalisation and the privatisation of the mines; and (2) a developmental state is required to implement such measures and to challenge entrenched political interests and foreign mining investors.",2020-04-01,The Extractive Industries and Society,https://openalex.org/V2765074323,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2019.10.013,310,320,7,2,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990091547,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2019.10.013,journal-article,2990091547

RNA contains a multifunctional RNA structure known as the trans-activator (TA) that (i) promotes subgenomic mRNA transcription from RNA1, (ii) facilitates replication of RNA2, and (iii) mediates particle assembly and copackaging of genome segments. The TA has long been considered a unique RNA element in RCNMV. However, by examining results from RCNMV genome analyses in the ViRAD virus (re-)annotation database, a putative functional RNA element in the polymerase-coding region of RNA1 was identified. Structural and functional analyses revealed that the novel RNA element adopts a TA-like structure (TALS) and, similar to the requirement of the TA for RNA replication, the TALS is necessary for the replication of RNA1. Both the TA and TALS possess near-identical asymmetrical internal loops that are critical for efficient replication of their corresponding genome segments, and these structural motifs were found to be functionally interchangeable. Moreover, replacement of the TA in RNA with a stabilized form of the TALS directed both RNA replication and packaging of both genome segments. Based on their comparable properties and considering evolutionary factors, we propose that the TALS appeared de novo in RNA1 first and, subsequently, the TA arose de novo in RNA as a functional mimic of the TALS. This and other related information were used to formulate a plausible evolutionary pathway to describe the genesis of the bi-segmented RCNMV genome.

PTSD and substance use disorders (SUD) commonly co-occur, but the impact of trauma age and count on PTSD treatment responses in a comorbid PTSD and SUD sample is unclear. Further, no studies have examined the impact of trauma characteristics on SUD treatment outcomes or whether their impact on either PTSD or SUD outcomes varies if PTSD is directly addressed. A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine: (1) whether trauma age and count influence comorbid PTSD and SUD (PTSD+SUD) responses during and following treatment; and (2) whether these effects differed across an exposure-based, integrated PTSD+SUD treatment (Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders using Prolonged Exposure; COPE) and a SUD-only focused treatment (Relapse Prevention Therapy; RPT). Individuals with PTSD+SUD randomized to COPE (n = 39) or RPT (n = 43) provided weekly measurements of PTSD and SUD. Across COPE and RPT, earlier trauma age predicted reduced SUD improvement (B = −0.01, standard error = 0.00). Trauma count did not predict changes in PTSD or SUD during or following treatment. These findings suggest that excluding individuals from exposure-based, integrated treatments on the basis of trauma characteristics is not empirically supported. However, individuals with earlier trauma ages may require additional or unique clinical attention to improve their SUD outcomes.",2020-01-22,Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment,https://openalex.org/V82881359,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.01.012,107976,107976,113,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001521272,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.01.012,journal-article,3001521272

In this paper, we investigate the data sponsored 5G system on a long-run basis. Compared with the conventional dynamic, i.e., long-run, model, the users in the system are memory-affecting, i.e., the users' decision-making is affected by their past service experience. In the system under our consideration, the users decide on the communication service access by jointly taking into account their instantaneous achievable utility and the history of their service experience, e.g., the past improved utility corresponding to the data sponsorship. The 5G system works as the utility provider for managing the communication service. Specifically, by using the concept of the power-law fading memory and the classical evolutionary game theory, we formulate a population game to model and study the dynamic behaviors of the players in the data sponsored 5G system. In the game, the interaction among the memory-affecting rational users is formulated as a fractional evolutionary game, and the communication service management of the 5G system is formulated as a classical evolutionary game. We analytically prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the population game. We both analytically and numerically verify the stability of the solution. The performance evaluation shows some insightful results. For example, the data sponsorship can significantly increase the data consumption for the users when they are heavily memory-affecting. Following this, we study a data sponsorship pricing problem with the objective to maximize the data consumption at the expense of the minimal data sponsorship.",2020-02-05,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,https://openalex.org/V90422530,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsac.2020.2971811,750,765,38,4,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005317604,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsac.2020.2971811,journal-article,3005317604

In 1971, Schmeidler proved a striking result on the interplay between these properties: On a connected topological space, a nontrivial bi-semicontinuous preorder is complete. Here we reformulate and extend this well-known theorem. First, we show that the topology is not independent of the preorder, contrary to what the original statement suggests. In fact, Schmeidler’s theorem can be restated as follows: A nontrivial preorder with a connected order-section topology is complete. Successively, we extend it to comonotonic bi-preferences: these are pairs of relations such that the first is a preorder, and the second consistently enlarges the first. In particular, a NaP -preference (necessary and possible preference, Giarlotta and Greco, 2013) is a comonotonic bi-preference with a complete second component. We prove two complementary results of the following kind: Special comonotonic bi-preferences with a connected order-section topology are NaP -preferences.

Here, we explored the neural basis of shape processing in a patient with visual agnosia following a circumscribed right hemisphere ventral lesion and evaluated longitudinal changes in the neural profile of shape representations. The results revealed a reduction of shape sensitivity slopes along the patient's right ventral pathway and a similar reduction in the contralesional left ventral pathway. Remarkably, posterior parts of the dorsal pathway bilaterally also evinced a reduction in shape sensitivity.

However, NGOs have not effectively utilised the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) audits to mobilise public demand for accountable government. I argue that the depoliticising logic of the governance paradigm that conflates the professionalized NGO with civil society undermines public participation. Moreover, the EITI serves to legitimize ongoing extraction: For instance the World Bank Group employs the mechanism as a fulcrum of its response to groups’ calls for substantive changes to oil industry management that would protect human rights, livelihoods and national sovereignty. By entrenching the involvement of a few NGOs in its processes, the EITI has had a limited resonance in public discourse and social actions. In contrast, mass mobilisations in Nigeria demanding government accountability, such as the January Uprising of 2012, spurred more significant disclosures about mismanagement of public revenues than NEITI, and reflected a resurgence of the vibrant 1990s civil society platform and mass movements which had been muted under neoliberal democratic transition.",2020-07-01,The Extractive Industries and Society,https://openalex.org/V2765074323,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2019.03.013,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2937918793,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2019.03.013,journal-article,2937918793

Findings shows that significant variances exist between the perceived likelihoods and impacts of global risks and their ranks at the global and the country/industry levels. These findings demonstrate that for country level actors at specific industries such as tourism the global risks can be viewed and evaluated differently. Particularly, the global economic risks and the global geopolitical risks are perceived by the respondents to be more likely to occur and have more impacts compared to the global environmental and technological risks. Subsequently, the rankings of the risks and the top five risks are also very different between the global and the country/industry specific levels.

We used computational analyses, genome organization assays, and microscopy, to investigate the relationship between chromosome territory positioning and gene expression.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis demonstrated the strengthening or loss of specific long-range chromatin interactions in response to rapamycin and quiescence induction, including a cluster of genes containing Interleukin-8 and several chemokine genes on chromosome 4.

A reliable myocardium strain analysis requires both correct segmentation and accurate motion tracking of the myocardium during the cardiac cycle. While many algorithms have been proposed for accurate tracking of the myocardium in tagged MR images, little focus has been placed on ensuring correct segmentation of the tagged myocardium during the cardiac cycle. Myocardial strain analysis is usually done by segmenting the myocardium in end-diastole, generating a mesh from the segmentation, propagating the mesh through the cardiac cycle using the output deformation field from motion tracking, and measuring strain on the deforming mesh. Due to the imposed tag strips on the anatomy, identification of the myocardium boundaries is challenging in tagged MR images. As a result, there is no guarantee that the propagated mesh is annotating the myocardium accurately through the cardiac cycle. Moreover, clinical studies indicate that incorrect myocardium annotation can result in overestimation of myocardial strains. Methods We introduce a method to improve reliability of strain analysis by proposing a mesh which correctly segments the myocardium in tagged MRI by leveraging the available cine MRI segmentation. In particular, we generate a series of mesh proposals using the cine MRI segmentation and find the propagated mesh proposal which gives the most accurate full-cycle myocardium segmentation. Results The mesh selection algorithm was tested on 2 2D MRI scans of diseased and healthy hearts. The proposed algorithm provided more accurate whole-cycle myocardium segmentation compared to the propagated end-diastolic mesh. Regional myocardium strain was measured for 1 3D MRI scans of healthy volunteers using the proposed mesh and the end-diastolic mesh. The measured strain using the proposed mesh was more similar to the expected myocardium strain for a healthy heart than the measured strain using the end-diastolic mesh.

Lately, there is a fast-growing interest in learning low-dimensional continuous representations of networks that can be utilized to perform highly accurate and scalable graph mining tasks. A family of these methods is based on performing random walks on a network to learn its structural features and providing the sequence of random walks as input to a deep learning architecture to learn a network embedding. While these methods perform well, they can only operate on static networks. However, in real-world, networks are evolving, as nodes and edges are continuously added or deleted. As a result, any previously obtained network representation will now be outdated having an adverse effect on the accuracy of the network mining task at stake. The naive approach to address this problem is to re-apply the embedding method of choice every time there is an update to the network. But this approach has serious drawbacks. First, it is inefficient, because the embedding method itself is computationally expensive. Then, the network mining task outcome obtained by the subsequent network representations are not directly comparable to each other, due to the randomness involved in the new set of random walks involved each time. In this paper, we propose EvoNRL , a random-walk based method for learning representations of evolving networks. The key idea of our approach is to first obtain a set of random walks on the current state of network. Then, while changes occur in the evolving network’s topology, to dynamically update the random walks in reserve, so they do not introduce any bias. That way we are in position of utilizing the updated set of random walks to continuously learn accurate mappings from the evolving network to a low-dimension network representation. Moreover, we present an analytical method for determining the right time to obtain a new representation of the evolving network that balances accuracy and time performance. A thorough experimental evaluation is performed that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method against sensible baselines and varying conditions.",2020-03-18,Applied Network Science,https://openalex.org/V3035517252,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00257-3,,,5,1,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995590401,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00257-3,journal-article,2995590401

However, how to best pre-select informative matrix entries given a sampling budget is largely unaddressed. In this paper, we propose a fast sample selection strategy for matrix completion from a graph signal processing perspective. Specifically, we first regularize the matrix reconstruction objective using a dual graph signal smoothness prior, resulting in a system of linear equations for solution. We then select appropriate samples to maximize the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$ of the coefficient matrix, thus maximizing the stability of the linear system. To efficiently solve this combinatorial problem, we derive a greedy sampling strategy, leveraging on Gershgorin circle theorem, that iteratively selects one sample (equivalent to shifting one Gershgorin disc) at a time corresponding to the largest magnitude entry in the first eigenvector of a modified graph Laplacian matrix. Our algorithm benefits computationally from warm start as the first eigenvectors of incremented Laplacian matrices are computed recurrently for more samples. To achieve computation scalability when sampling large matrices, we further rewrite the coefficient matrix as a sum of two separate components, each of which exhibits block-diagonal structure that we exploit for alternating block-wise sampling. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our graph sampling algorithm substantially outperforms existing sampling schemes for matrix completion and reduces the completion error, when combined with a range of modern matrix completion algorithms.",2020-04-20,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,https://openalex.org/V168680287,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2020.2988784,2814,2829,68,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018660603,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2020.2988784,journal-article,3018660603

Panelists rated recommendations, derived from prior research and organized by a 6-domain PCC framework, on a 7-point Likert scale in an online survey. We used summary statistics to report response frequencies and defined consensus as when ≥85% panelists chose 5 to 7. <h3>Results</h3> The response rate was 100%. In round 1, women and professionals retained 4 (97.9%) and 4 (89.4%) of 4 initial recommendations, respectively. The round 2 survey included  recommendations for women and 5 recommendations for professionals (did not achieve consensus in round  or were newly suggested). In round 2, women retained  of  recommendations and professionals retained  of 5 recommendations. Overall,  recommendations were generated. Both groups agreed on  (94.0%) recommendations (13 retained by 100% of both women and clinicians): fostering patient-physician relationship (n = 11), exchanging information (n = 10), responding to emotions (n = 4), managing uncertainty (n = 5), making decisions (n = 8), and enabling patient self-management (n = 6). <h3>Conclusion</h3> The recommendations represent the range of PCC domains, are based on evidence from primary research, and reflect high concordance between women and professional panelists. They can inform the development of policies, guidelines, programs, and performance measures that foster PCCW.",2020-07-14,Value in Health,https://openalex.org/V678965,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.03.017,1012,1019,23,8,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3042405756,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.03.017,journal-article,3042405756

The generating function F P , ρ of ( P , ρ ) -partitions is a polynomial that, when the images of ρ tend to infinity, tends to Stanley’s generating function of P -partitions. Analogous to Stanley’s fundamental theorem for P -partitions, we show the set of ( P , ρ ) -partitions decomposes as a disjoint union of ( L , ρ ) -partitions where L runs over the set of linear extensions of P . In this more general context, the set of all F L , ρ for linear orders L over determines a basis of polynomials. We thus introduce the notion of flagged ( P , ρ ) -partitions, and we prove the set of all F L , ρ for flagged ( L , ρ ) -partitions for linear orders L is precisely the fundamental slide basis of the polynomial ring, introduced by the first author and Searles. Our main theorem shows that any generating function F P , ρ of flagged ( P , ρ ) -partitions is a positive integer linear combination g slide polynomials.

All participants completed a medical examination every year during 2011-2016, and BMI levels were measured two to six (average 5.6) times. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify BMI trajectories over time. New-onset diabetes was confirmed in 2016.During 2011-2016, four distinct BMI trajectories were identified according to BMI range and changing pattern over time: ""low"" (19.6%), ""moderate"" (33.4%), ""moderate-high"" (33.4%) and ""high"" (13.6%). A total of 16 (3.7%) new-onset diabetes cases were confirmed in 2016. Compared with the ""low"" BMI trajectory, participants in the ""high"" BMI trajectory were at significantly higher risk for new-onset diabetes (adjusted relative risk 3.24, 95% confidence interval 1.27-8.24). Notably, BMI trajectories based on the first four or three annual BMI tests yielded similar results. By contrast, no significant correlation was found between categories of baseline BMI and new-onset diabetes in 201 after multivariate adjustment.The present results show that distinct BMI trajectories, even identified using just four or three annual BMI tests, are significantly associated with new-onset diabetes.

We examined the probability of selection given different resource types. Increasing shrub cover, lower and relatively more flat sites, increasing normalized difference vegetation index, and solar radiation all significantly predicted likelihood of observed selection within the area sampled.

In addition to the cancer-associated fibroblasts, adipose cells have also recently been described among the pivotal actors of the tumor microenvironment responsible for sustaining tumor development and progression. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that not only the mature adipocytes but also the adipose stem cells (ASCs) are able to establish a strict crosstalk with the tumour cells, thus resulting in a reciprocal reprogramming of both the tumor and adipose components. This review will focus on the metabolic changes induced by this interaction as a driver of fate determination occurring in cancer-associated ASCs (CA-ASCs) to support the tumor metabolic requirements. We will showcase the major role played by the metabolic changes occurring in the adipose tumor microenvironment that regulates ASC fate and consequently cancer progression. Our new results will also highlight the CA-ASC response in vitro by using a coculture system of primary ASCs grown with cancer cells originating from two different types of adrenal cancers [adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and pheochromocytoma].

When selecting expansion terms, most traditional models do not simultaneously consider term frequency and the co‐occurrence relationships between candidate terms and query terms. Intuitively, however, a term that has a higher co‐occurrence with a query term is more likely to be related to the query topic. In this article, we propose a kernel co‐occurrence‐based framework to enhance retrieval performance by integrating term co‐occurrence information into the Rocchio model and a relevance language model (RM3). Specifically, a kernel co‐occurrence‐based Rocchio method (KRoc) and a kernel co‐occurrence‐based RM3 method (KRM3) are proposed.

According to the EMPDS, self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism indirectly influence depressive symptoms through rumination and difficulty accepting the past. Yet, the extent to which self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, rumination, and difficulty accepting the past uniquely and collectively influence depressive symptoms is unestablished. Likewise, supporting evidence derives from relatively healthy university students, rendering the generalizability of the EMPDS to more distressed individuals unclear. Our study addressed these important limitations. Data were obtained from 393 depressed individuals. Congruent with the EMPDS, bias-corrected bootstrapped tests of mediation indicated that socially prescribed perfectionism indirectly predicted depressive symptoms through rumination and difficulty accepting the past. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism indirectly predicted depressive symptoms through rumination, but not difficulty accepting the past.

Freshwater (FW) fish experience passive paracellular loss of ions into the surrounding environment across water-exposed epithelia such as the gill. The mitigation of paracellular ion loss is thought to be regulated by proteins of the tight junction (TJ) complex and in particular, the large superfamily of claudin (cldn) TJ proteins plays an important role. Transcript and protein levels of TJ proteins in teleosts are known to be under endocrine control of several important osmoregulatory hormones and the current study was aimed at determining whether the osmoregulatory hormone, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), can alter paracellular permeability and TJ protein abundance in a primary cultured gill epithelium derived from rainbow trout. Natriuretic peptide receptors were detected in the cultured trout gill epithelium. It was found that (i) developing cultured gill epithelia ""grown"" in the presence of 10 nM CNP, and (ii) mature cultured gill epithelia exposed to 10 nM CNP for 4 h, exhibited augmented barrier properties. This occurred in association with reduced flux rates of a paracellular permeability marker (polyethylene glycol, molecular mass 400; PEG-400) and, reduced ion efflux (i.e. ion loss) when preparations were exposed to apical FW. Exposure to CNP altered mRNA abundance of cldn-3a, -5a, -6, - 8c, -20a, -25b, -28a, -32a and cgn , but differences in the transcriptional response were observed between chronic and acute CNP exposure. In contrast, chronic and acute exposure to CNP resulted in reduced cldn-10e /Cldn-10e abundance. Data suggest that CNP may play a role in regulating the molecular physiology of the TJ complex in the fish gill epithelium and contribute to the regulation of salt and water balance by influencing the paracellular permeability properties of this tissue.",2020-02-01,Peptides,https://openalex.org/V120382301,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.170211,170211,170211,124,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989904807,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.170211,journal-article,2989904807

In this paper, we describe the context and motivations for the Workshop and summarize the proceedings. In particular, we identify 37 high-priority Mars Amazonian and present-day climate questions that arose from presentations and discussion at the workshop, which we group under Key Questions on (1) interpreting the record in the Polar Layered Deposits, (2) identifying and characterizing off-polar climate records (such as large subsurface mid-latitude ice deposits and signs of aqueous alteration), (3) the global budget of dust/sand, salts, and ice, and (4) the global movement of these materials. These 37 questions pertain to processes in the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface active in the present and past, as well as the record they leave of the historical climate. As many of the processes of interest are interconnected, the questions we present are often intertwined; some questions are identified as being of highest-priority because of their larger scientific value and/or that addressing it would contribute important information towards answering many other questions. Related to the high-priority questions, we identify key measurements in the areas of PLD formation and evolution, surface change/interactions, state of global reservoirs, and environmental (surface/atmospheric) conditions. Our objective is for these lists of high-priority questions and measurements to contribute towards discussion of future Mars scientific exploration, and to record the state of Mars Amazonian climate knowledge as of the time of our workshop.",2020-03-01,Planetary and Space Science,https://openalex.org/V105500771,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2019.104813,104813,104813,182,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990658925,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2019.104813,journal-article,2990658925

However, what would it mean if ‘mental illness’ was not seen as a ‘limitation’, but rather as an ‘epistemological position’ from which the social world is experienced, understood and acted upon? What would it mean if our theories about ‘distress’ and ‘helping’ were premised on the subjugated knowledges of psychiatrized children and youth? The consumer/survivor-led research movement has made significant gains in answering these questions for the adult, but not necessarily for the child and youth mental health field. The purpose of this article is to critically examine the significance of psychiatrized young people setting and executing their own research and, ultimately, practice agendas. Presented are the outcomes of an evaluation of a participatory action research project examining the stigma of mental illness conducted with seven psychiatrized youth, 1 to 1 years old. The outcomes suggest our roles as practitioners and researchers need to shift from being ‘agents’ working on behalf of to ‘allies’ working in solidarity with young people to change the social conditions of their marginalization.

Here we develop a mathematical model and conduct qualitative analysis for the transmission dynamics of T. rangeli. We incorporate both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes, and account for the pathogenic effect using infection-induced fecundity and fertility change of the triatomine bugs. We derive two thresholds R v (the triatomine bug basic reproduction number) and R 0 (the T. rangeli basic reproduction number) to delineate the dynamical behaviors of the ecological and epidemiological systems. We show that when R v > 1 and R 0 > 1 , a unique parasite positive equilibrium E* appears. We find that E* can be unstable and periodic oscillations can be observed where the pathogenic effect plays a significant role. Implications of the qualitative analysis and numerical simulations suggest the need of an integrative vector-borne disease prevention and control strategy when multiple vector-borne diseases are transmitted by the same set of vector species.",2020-06-01,Mathematical biosciences,https://openalex.org/V4210190100,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108326,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007165478,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108326,journal-article,3007165478

We argue that infants’ speech discrimination abilities are best viewed through a lens that considers both synchronic and diachronic aspects of the particular speech contrast. The key to this approach is the notion that acoustic–perceptual salience, or the relative separation of speech categories along perceptually relevant acoustic dimensions and corresponding discrimination performance in adults, is reflected in both infant's perceptual performance and patterns observed in phonological typology and history. The present review highlights challenges offered by four decades of literature, identifies broad patterns in infant vowel perception according to the acoustic properties of speech contrasts, and offers linguistically motivated explanations and directions for future research into the nature of young infants’ discrimination abilities.",2020-05-01,Language and Linguistics Compass,https://openalex.org/V60635053,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12369,,,14,5,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008680342,https://doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12369,journal-article,3008680342

This study investigated the impact of an exercise intervention on fronto-temporal cortical plasticity in female participants with early psychosis. In a cohort of 5 female participants with early psychosis from Hong Kong, we investigated the effects of a 12-week, moderate intensity aerobic or Hatha yoga exercise trial (yoga ( N = 21), aerobic ( N = 18) or waitlist group ( N = 12)) on cortical grey matter. Clinical assessments and structural MRI were completed pre- and post- a 12-week exercise intervention. Increases in cortical volume and thickness were observed in the medial temporal cortical regions, primarily in fusiform cortical thickness (F(2, 48) = 4.221, p = 0.020, η 2 = 0.150) and volume (F(2, 48) = 3.521, p = 0.037, η 2 = 0.128) for participants with early psychosis in the aerobic arm, but not in the yoga and waitlist arms. Increased fusiform cortical thickness (ß = 0.402, p = 0.003) was associated with increased hippocampal volume for all psychosis participants. For the aerobic group only, increases in the entorhinal and fusiform temporal gyri were associated with reduced symptom severity. These findings suggest exercise-induced neuroplasticity in medial temporal cortical regions occurs with aerobic exercise. These changes may be associated with improvements in psychosis symptom severity. People with early psychosis may benefit from exercise interventions, particularly aerobic exercise, as an adjunct treatment to address clinical, physical health, and neuroanatomic concerns.

This methodology is only applicable in large open spaces where flashover may not occur. This paper studies the effect of various design fires, including traditional uniform fires and for the first time iTFM on flat-plate unbonded post-tensioned (UPT) concrete, a structural system which allows long flooring spans (> 8 m). The predictions of a structural model of high temperature unbonded prestressing tendon relaxation that is available in the literature are compared for the first time with previously published fire experiments thus validating the model. A novel case study based on a real building was then analysed using the model to propose an acceptance criterion based on the longest tendon length where rupture and extreme stress relaxation is prevented. Two types of steel, fabricated according to BS 5896 and AS/NZ4672, were analysed for various unbonded lengths (between 8.15 m and 65.2 m). Emphasis is on the unique deformation mechanisms present when prestressing steel is heated locally. The relaxation model has been validated for negligible slab deflection, allowing for discussion on the difference between the impact of travelling and uniform fires on the design of UPT concrete. The tendon rupture and relaxation analysis have novelty in showing that slow moving fires are more onerous structurally than fast moving or uniform fires and therefore are important to consider when defining critical design thermal boundaries in a design context. Results also demonstrate that tendons in similar designs require consideration to be limited in unbonded length. The development of new acceptance criteria herein is the first step in producing a generalized criteria for better informed structural fire design of UPT concrete exposed to fire.",2020-05-01,Fire Technology,https://openalex.org/V93646482,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10694-019-00927-4,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991062200,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10694-019-00927-4,journal-article,2991062200

The model is based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system for ion transport coupled with membrane fluxes including the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Using asymptotic analysis, we derived a simplified zero-dimensional model, which we denote as the membrane model in this paper, as a leading order approximation. Our analysis provides justification for the assumption in membrane models that electric potential is constant in the intracellular space. This is essential to explain the superposition of two membrane potentials that leads to a significant transcellular potential. Numerical simulations are also carried out to support our analytical findings.",2020-02-21,Journal of Theoretical Biology,https://openalex.org/V109682412,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110107,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995589820,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110107,journal-article,2995589820
