It is the underlying technology for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.",2020-04-01,International Journal of Information Management,https://openalex.org/V189354248,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.10.014,102029,102029,51,,0,130,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983579204,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.10.014,journal-article,2983579204

In this meta-analysis, we estimated the associations between ELS and the risk for onset of MDD before age 18 years. In addition, we examined the associations between eight specific forms of ELS (ie, sexual abuse, physical abuse, poverty, physical illness/injury, death of a family member, domestic violence, natural disaster, and emotional abuse) and risk for youth-onset MDD.We conducted a systematic search in scientific databases for studies that assessed both ELS and the presence or absence of MDD before age 18 years. We identified 6 journal articles with a total of 44,066 unique participants. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. When heterogeneous effect sizes were detected, we tested whether demographic and/or methodological factors moderated the association between ELS and MDD.Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we found that individuals who experienced ELS were more likely to develop MDD before the age of 18 years than were individuals without a history of ELS (odds ratio = 2.50; 95% confidence interval 2.08, 3.00). Separate meta-analyses revealed a range of associations with MDD: whereas some types of ELS (eg, poverty) were not associated with MDD, other types (eg, emotional abuse) were associated more strongly with MDD than was ELS considered more broadly.These findings provide important evidence that the adverse effect of ELS on MDD risk manifests early in development, prior to adulthood, and varies by type of ELS.",2020-07-01,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V60711021,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2019.10.011,842,855,59,7,0,95,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984569157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2019.10.011,journal-article,2984569157

Powered by latest technological advances in AI and machine learning, they offer automated procedures to create fake content that is harder and harder to detect to human observers. The possibilities to deceive are endless, including manipulated pictures, videos and audio, that will have large societal impact. Because of this, organizations need to understand the inner workings of the underlying techniques, as well as their strengths and limitations. This article provides a working definition of deepfakes together with an overview of the underlying technology. We classify different deepfake types: photo (face- and body-swapping), audio (voice-swapping, text to speech), video (face-swapping, face-morphing, full body puppetry) and audio and video (lip-synching), and identify risks and opportunities to help organizations think about the future of deepfakes. Finally, we propose the R.E.A.L. framework to manage deepfake risks: Record original content to assure deniability, Expose deepfakes early, Advocate for legal protection and Leverage trust to counter credulity.

However, accurate prediction on the wind speed value is still quite challenging due to three features of wind speed: randomness, fluctuation and unpredictability. Though many previous works have studied decomposition-based methods for preprocessing, these methods are difficult to use in actual prediction, since the newly acquired data will greatly affect the values of the initial decomposed subsequences. To solve this problem, a good solution referred as the wavelet soft threshold denoising (WSTD) is proposed herein, which is also systematically introduced for the first time. Moreover, a novel deep learning method gated recurrent unit (GRU) is successfully developed to be combined with WSTD to forecast the wind speed series in this paper. In the ensemble WSTD-GRU model, the WSTD is applied to filter the redundant information from the original data of wind speed series; GRU, which is particularly advantageous for learning the features in case of cooperating with WSTD, is adopted to predict the future multi-step wind speed values. Also, the parameters of the GRU are adjusted by cross-validated grid-search, and they are visualized in the paper. In experiments, thirty-five commonly used models are involved for comparison to evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed model, through the datasets from four sites in the United States covering a wide range of longitudes. Finally, a superior performance of this methodology with relatively high accuracy, fast forecasting speed, small volatility of results and good adaptability is verified by the test results of case studies aforementioned.",2020-03-01,Energy Conversion and Management,https://openalex.org/V105637730,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112524,112524,112524,207,,0,66,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005289256,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112524,journal-article,3005289256

The modes represent different aspects of brain aging, showing distinct patterns of functional and structural brain change, and distinct patterns of association with genetics, lifestyle, cognition, physical measures and disease. While conventional brain-age modelling found no genetic associations, 3 modes had genetic associations.

Here we show stronger negative associations of living in high-lead-risk census tracts in children from lower- versus higher-income families. With increasing risk of exposure, children from lower-income families exhibited lower cognitive test scores, smaller cortical volume and smaller cortical surface area. Reducing environmental insults associated with lead-exposure risk might confer greater benefit to children experiencing more environmental adversity, and further understanding of the factors associated with high lead-exposure risk will be critical for improving such outcomes in children.

Visualising their dynamics in live cells at single-molecule resolution is essential to elucidate their role in RNA metabolism. RNA aptamers, such as Spinach and Mango, have recently emerged as a powerful background-free technology for live-cell RNA imaging due to their fluorogenic properties upon ligand binding. Here, we report a novel array of Mango II aptamers for RNA imaging in live and fixed cells with high contrast and single-molecule sensitivity. Direct comparison of Mango II and MS2-tdMCP-mCherry dual-labelled mRNAs show marked improvements in signal to noise ratio using the fluorogenic Mango aptamers. Using both coding (β-actin mRNA) and long non-coding (NEAT1) RNAs, we show that the Mango array does not affect cellular localisation.

We aimed to evaluate the lifetime prevalence of TBI in this population, and to summarise findings on TBI incidence and the association between TBI and health-related or functioning-related outcomes.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched without date restrictions for original research studies in English that reported data on the prevalence or incidence of TBI, or the association between TBI and one or more health-related or function-related outcome measures. Studies were included if they had a group or clearly identifiable subgroup of individuals who were homeless, marginally housed, or seeking services for homeless people. With use of random-effects models, we calculated pooled estimates of the lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI and the lifetime prevalence of moderate or severe TBI. We used meta-regression and subgroup analysis to evaluate potential moderators of prevalence estimates and the leave-one-out method for sensitivity analyses. We then summarised findings from all studies that evaluated TBI incidence and the association between TBI and health-related or functioning-related outcomes. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.5.1. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019119678.Of 46 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 3 studies were included in the systematic review and 2 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI in homeless and marginally housed individuals (18 studies, n=9702 individuals) was 53·1% (95% CI 46·4-59·7; I2=97%) and the lifetime prevalence of moderate or severe TBI (nine studies, n=5787) was 22·5% (13·5-35·0; I2=99%). The method used to ascertain TBI history, the age of the sample, and the sample size significantly moderated estimated lifetime prevalence of any severity of TBI. TBI was consistently associated with poorer self-reported physical and mental health, higher suicidality and suicide risk, memory concerns, and increased health service use and criminal justice system involvement.The lifetime prevalence of TBI is high among homeless and marginally housed individuals, and a history of TBI is associated with poorer health and general functioning.

The ability to visualize tissue in varied contrasts in the form of MR pulse sequences in a single scan provides valuable insights to physicians, as well as enabling automated systems performing downstream analysis. However, many issues like prohibitive scan time, image corruption, different acquisition protocols, or allergies to certain contrast materials may hinder the process of acquiring multiple sequences for a patient. This poses challenges to both physicians and automated systems since complementary information provided by the missing sequences is lost. In this paper, we propose a variant of generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of leveraging redundant information contained within multiple available sequences in order to generate one or more missing sequences for a patient scan. The proposed network is designed as a multi-input, multi-output network which combines information from all the available pulse sequences and synthesizes the missing ones in a single forward pass. We demonstrate and validate our method on two brain MRI datasets each with four sequences, and show the applicability of the proposed method in simultaneously synthesizing all missing sequences in any possible scenario where either one, two, or three of the four sequences may be missing.

In this paper, we focus on the item cold-start problem. Both content information (e.g., item attributes) and initial user ratings are valuable for seizing users’ preferences on a new item. However, previous methods for the item cold-start problem either (1) incorporate content information into collaborative filtering to perform hybrid recommendation, or (2) actively select users to rate the new item without considering content information and then do collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation scheme for the item cold-start problem by leveraging both active learning and items’ attribute information. Specifically, we design useful user selection criteria based on items’ attributes and users’ rating history, and combine the criteria in an optimization framework for selecting users. By exploiting the feedback ratings, users’ previous ratings and items’ attributes, we then generate accurate rating predictions for the other unselected users. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method over traditional methods.",2020-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,https://openalex.org/V30698027,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2019.2891530,631,644,32,4,1,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2963878746,https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2019.2891530,journal-article,2963878746

Together with paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic data, we compare and contrast the pace of deglaciation and the response of glaciers to major climate events. During the Global Last Glacial Maximum (GLGM, 26.5-19 ka), average temperatures decreased 4°to 8°C in the Americas, but precipitation varied strongly throughout this large region. Many glaciers in North and Central America achieved their maximum extent during the GLGM, whereas others advanced even farther during the subsequent Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS-1). Glaciers in the Andes also expanded during the GLGM, but that advance was not the largest, except on Tierra del Fuego. HS-1 (17.5-14.6 ka) was a time of general glacier thickening and advance throughout most of North and Central America, and in the tropical Andes; however, glaciers in the temperate and subpolar Andes thinned and retreated during this period. During the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (B-A, 14.6-12.9 ka), glaciers retreated throughout North and Central America and, in some cases, completely disappeared. Many glaciers advanced during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.6-12.9 ka) in the tropical Andes and Patagonia.

To date, most research regarding environmental chemicals and neonatal outcomes has focused on the effect of individual agents.In a prospective cohort of 38 pregnant women from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003-2006), we used biomarkers to estimate exposure to 4 phenols, phthalates, metals, organophosphate/pyrethroid/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and environmental tobacco smoke. Using three approaches, we estimated covariate-adjusted associations of chemical mixtures or individual chemicals with gestational-age-specific birth weight z-scores, birth length, head circumference, and gestational age: k-means clustering, principal components (PC), and one-chemical-at-a-time regression.We identified three chemical mixture profiles using k-means clustering. Women in cluster 1 had higher concentrations of most phenols, three phthalate metabolites, several metals, organophosphate/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and several PFAS than women in clusters 2 and 3. On average, infants born to women in clusters 1 (-1.2 cm; 95% CI: -1.9, -0.5) and 2 (-0.5 cm; 95% CI: -1.1, 0.1) had lower birth length than infants in cluster 3. Six PCs explained 50% of the variance in biomarker concentrations and biomarkers with similar chemical structures or from shared commercial/industrial settings loaded onto commons PCs.

Updating multi-scaffold drafts to chromosome-level status can be achieved through experimental mapping or re-sequencing efforts. Avoiding the costs associated with such approaches, comparative genomic analysis of gene order conservation (synteny) to predict scaffold neighbours (adjacencies) offers a potentially useful complementary method for improving draft assemblies. Results We evaluated and employed 3 gene synteny-based methods applied to 2 Anopheles mosquito assemblies to produce consensus sets of scaffold adjacencies. For subsets of the assemblies, we integrated these with additional supporting data to confirm and complement the synteny-based adjacencies:  with physical mapping data that anchor scaffolds to chromosome locations, 1 with paired-end RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data, and 3 with new assemblies based on re-scaffolding or long-read data. Our combined analyses produced 2 new superscaffolded assemblies with improved contiguities: 7 for which assignments of non-anchored scaffolds to chromosome arms span more than 75% of the assemblies, and a further 7 with chromosome anchoring including an 88% anchored Anopheles arabiensis assembly and, respectively, 73% and 84% anchored assemblies with comprehensively updated cytogenetic photomaps for Anopheles funestus and Anopheles stephensi . Conclusions Experimental data from probe mapping, RNAseq, or long-read technologies, where available, all contribute to successful upgrading of draft assemblies.

This paper presents an application of the Internet-of-Things for model-based evaluation of microclimate parameters inside two greenhouse crop production systems. The objectives thus were to develop (i) a comfort ratio model, and (ii) a custom-built wireless sensor for data fusion in order to evaluate and compare microclimate parameters inside two different tropical greenhouses prior to the actual cultivation of tomato. The model was implemented in MATLAB Simulink with a flexible architecture and self-tuning reference inputs to work with different crops and cultural practices within which various growth stages can be modeled and analyzed. The accuracy and functional reliability of the sensor, as well as the performance of the model were validated by collecting and analyzing microclimate data from a naturally ventilated net-covered Screenhouse and a Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse under tropical lowland climate conditions of Malaysia. Raw data including air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation were processed by the model for simulating comfort ratio values associated with different growth stages. Preliminary results showed that the mean and maximum vapor pressure deficit were respectively 1.19 and 5.1 kPa in the Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse and 0.97 and 3.81 kPa in the Screenhouse. Analyses based on comfort ratio values were validated with the results from raw data, showing that when temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit were in the range of 2 ±  °C, 8 ± 20%, and 1.1±1 kPa in the Screenhouse, the comfort ratio values associated with the optimum reference borders were higher than those in the Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse. This study thus suggests that comfort ratio index is a more revealing indicator for comparing two or more greenhouses based on the dynamic assessment of microclimate parameters. The proposed method takes into an account the variation in each parameter, not only with the respect to different reference borders, but also by considering different time frames, light conditions and growth stages. The presented IoT sensor node and the Simulink model provide growers with a better insight into interpreting crop growth environment. The results of this study can contribute to optimal control strategies for a more efficient greenhouse crop production. • IoT sensor data fusion were used for model-based evaluation of greenhouse microclimate parameters. • A novel comfort ratio model was developed and implemented in Simulink. • The model was interfaced with the IoT sensors for dynamic assessment of two greenhouses prior to the actual cultivation. • An optimization algorithm was developed for set-point manipulation in microclimate control.",2020-08-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121303,121303,121303,263,,1,33,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016167672,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121303,journal-article,3016167672

Entrainment of peripheral clocks to mealtime is accomplished by multiple feeding-related signals, including absorbed nutrients and metabolic hormones, acting in parallel or in series in a tissue-specific fashion. Less is known about the signals that synchronize circadian clocks in the brain with feeding time, some of which are presumed to generate the circadian rhythms of food-anticipatory activity that emerge when food is restricted to a fixed daily mealtime. In this commentary, I consider the possibility that food-anticipatory activity rhythms are driven or entrained by circulating ghrelin, ketone bodies or insulin. While evidence supports the potential of these signals to participate in the induction or amount of food-anticipatory behavior, it falls short of establishing either a necessary or sufficient role or accounting for circadian properties of anticipatory rhythms. The availability of multiple, circulating signals by which circadian oscillators in many brain regions might entrain to mealtime has supported a view that food-anticipatory rhythms of behavior are mediated by a broadly distributed system of clocks. The evidence, however, does not rule out the possibility that multiple peripheral and central food-entrained oscillators and feeding-related signals converge on circadian oscillators in a defined location which ultimately set the phase and gate the expression of anticipatory activity rhythms. A candidate location is the dorsal striatum, a core component of the neural system which mediates reward, motivation and action and which contains circadian oscillators entrainable by food and dopaminergic drugs. Systemic metabolic signals, such as ghrelin, ketones and insulin, may participate in circadian food anticipation to the extent that they modulate dopamine afferents to circadian clocks in this area.</ns4:p>",2020-01-29,F1000Research,https://openalex.org/V4210239046,F1000 Research Ltd,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20829.1,61,61,9,,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003659661,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20829.1,journal-article,3003659661

State-of-the-art solutions mostly work on a single WiFi channel and hence are quite sensitive to the quality of a particular channel. Co-channel interference in an indoor environment can seriously undermine the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we for the first time explore wideband WiFi information with advanced deep learning toward more accurate and robust activity recognition. We present a practical C hannel S elective A ctivity R ecognition system (CSAR) with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. The key innovation is to actively select available WiFi channels with good quality and seamlessly hop among adjacent channels to form an extended channel . The wider bandwidth with more subcarriers offers stable information with a higher resolution for feature extraction. Conventional classification tools, e.g., hidden Markov model and k-nearest neighbors, however, are not only sensitive to feature distortion but also not smart enough to explore the time-scale correlations from the extracted spectrogram. We accordingly explore advanced deep learning tools for this application context. We demonstrate an integration of channel selection and long short term memory network (LSTM), which seamlessly combine the richer time and frequency features for activity recognition.

Administration of oxytocin and testosterone is associated with increased and reduced indicators of empathy, respectively, but how levels of these hormones are jointly affected by naturalistic empathy-inducing stimuli remains unclear. In this study, salivary oxytocin and testosterone levels were measured in 173 healthy adults before and after watching a video involving a gravely ill child. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess psychological variables predicted to affect oxytocin reactivity (Autism-Spectrum Quotient, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Empathy and Systemizing Quotients). On average, there was a 14% increase in oxytocin (p = 0.003) and 4% decrease in testosterone (p = 0.001) pre- to post-video. Opposite directional changes in hormone levels occurred together, as supported by a chi-square test (p < 0.001) and a circular statistics test (p < 0.05). Considered separately, psychological traits did not predict hormone levels or changes to any appreciable degree. However, oxytocin and testosterone changes were linked with empathy relative to systemizing such that: (1) 'Empathy Bias' was associated with a large oxytocin increase but little change in testosterone, while (2) 'Systemizing Bias' and 'Balance' between empathy and systemizing were associated with a decrease in testosterone but little change in oxytocin. These findings suggest that participants were divisible into 'high oxytocin responders' (relatively empathetic) and 'high testosterone responders' (balanced or systemizing-biased). These findings support a model of joint, opposite changes in oxytocin and testosterone under experimental empathy induction, with high, somewhat predictable, diversity in individual responses.",2020-01-01,Hormones and Behavior,https://openalex.org/V170105747,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104607,104607,104607,117,,0,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985278899,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104607,journal-article,2985278899

Researchers often use glucocorticoid concentrations (hormones that can be associated with stressors) to gauge the impact of anthropogenic factors (e.g. urbanization, noise and light pollution). Yet, no general relationships between human-induced environmental change and glucocorticoids have emerged. Given the number of recent studies reporting baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the primary glucocorticoid in birds and reptiles) concentrations worldwide, it is now possible to conduct large-scale comparative analyses to test for general associations between disturbance and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone across species. Additionally, we can control for factors that may influence context, such as life history stage, environmental conditions and urban adaptability of a species. Here, we take a phylogenetically informed approach and use data from HormoneBase to test if baseline and stress-induced corticosterone are valid indicators of exposure to human footprint index, human population density, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night in birds and reptiles. Our results show a negative relationship between anthropogenic noise and baseline corticosterone for birds characterized as urban avoiders. While our results potentially indicate that urban avoiders are more sensitive to noise than other species, overall our study suggests that the relationship between human-induced environmental change and corticosterone varies across species and contexts; we found no general relationship between human impacts and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone in birds, nor baseline corticosterone in reptiles. Therefore, it should not be assumed that high or low levels of exposure to human-induced environmental change are associated with high or low corticosterone levels, respectively, or that closely related species, or even individuals, will respond similarly. Moving forward, measuring alternative physiological traits alongside reproductive success, health and survival may provide context to better understand the potential negative effects of human-induced environmental change.",2020-01-01,Conservation Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2734435911,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coz110,,,8,1,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000853233,https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coz110,journal-article,3000853233

Each component of current protein–polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs) generally induces immunity specific to one of the approximately 100 pneumococcal serotypes, and typically eliminates it from carriage and IPD through herd immunity. Overall carriage rates remain stable owing to replacement by non-PCV serotypes. Consequently, the net change in IPD incidence is determined by the relative invasiveness of the pre- and post-PCV-carried pneumococcal populations. In the present study, we identified PCVs expected to minimize the post-vaccine IPD burden by applying Bayesian optimization to an ecological model of serotype replacement that integrated epidemiological and genomic data. We compared optimal formulations for reducing infant-only or population-wide IPD, and identified potential benefits to including non-conserved pneumococcal carrier proteins. Vaccines were also devised to minimize IPD resistant to antibiotic treatment, despite the ecological model assuming that resistance levels in the carried population would be preserved. We found that expanding infant-administered PCV valency is likely to result in diminishing returns, and that complementary pairs of infant- and adult-administered vaccines could be a superior strategy. PCV performance was highly dependent on the circulating pneumococcal population, further highlighting the advantages of a diversity of anti-pneumococcal vaccination strategies. Here the authors have developed a framework to predict which Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes would be best targeted by vaccination, of children and adults, to prevent the post-vaccine emergence of similarly virulent strains, thereby minimizing the pneumococcal disease burden.",2020-02-03,Nature microbiology,https://openalex.org/V2764926557,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0651-y,473,485,5,3,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003540327,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0651-y,journal-article,3003540327

Study 2 replicated these findings with a nationally representative sample of Americans. Three experiments then tested whether situational attributions for poverty are malleable and motivate egalitarianism. Bolstering situational attributions for poverty through a writing exercise (Study 3) and a computer-based poverty simulation (Studies 4a and b) increased egalitarian action and reduced support for inequality immediately (Studies 3 and 4b), 1 d later and 155 d post-intervention (Study 4b). Causal attributions for poverty offer one accessible means of shaping inequality-reducing attitudes and actions.

Currently, most salmon habitat occurs in watersheds in which glacier ice is present and retreating. This synthesis examines the multiple ways that glacier retreat can influence aquatic ecosystems through the lens of Pacific salmon life cycles. We predict that the coming decades will result in areas in which salmon populations will be challenged by diminished water flows and elevated water temperatures, areas in which salmon productivity will be enhanced as downstream habitat suitability increases, and areas in which new river and lake habitat will be formed that can be colonized by anadromous salmon.

Imperfection in the acquisition process means that point clouds are often corrupted with noise. Building on recent advances in graph signal processing, we design local algorithms for 3D point cloud denoising. Specifically, we design a signal-dependent feature graph Laplacian regularizer (SDFGLR) that assumes surface normals computed from point coordinates are piecewise smooth with respect to a signal-dependent graph Laplacian matrix. Using SDFGLR as a signal prior, we formulate an optimization problem with a general 'p-norm fidelity term that can explicitly remove only two types of additive noise: small but non-sparse noise like Gaussian (using ' fidelity term) and large but sparser noise like Laplacian (using ' fidelity term). To establish a linear relationship between normals and 3D point coordinates, we first perform bipartite graph approximation to divide the point cloud into two disjoint node sets (red and blue). We then optimize the red and blue nodes' coordinates alternately. For '2-norm fidelity term, we iteratively solve an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, efficiently computed using conjugate gradient with a bounded condition number to ensure numerical stability. For '1-norm fidelity term, we iteratively minimize an '1-'2 cost function using accelerated proximal gradient (APG), where a good step size is chosen via Lipschitz continuity analysis. Finally, we propose simple mean and median filters for flat patches of a given point cloud to estimate the noise variance given the noise type, which in turn is used to compute a weight parameter trading off the fidelity term and signal prior in the problem formulation.

The branched polymers, containing between 0.25 and 2.00 mol% molecular branching, were cast into membranes and comprehensively characterized as polymer electrolyte membranes. Comparison to a linear, unbranched polymer analogue showed universally improved membrane properties as a result of branching. Branched membranes possessed greater tensile strength in the dry state and minor reductions in elongation at break. In the wet state, branched membranes showed improvements in both tensile strength and elongation at break, up to 4 and 43%, respectively. Water sorption decreased with increasing branching content, from 119% water uptake and 145% dimensional swelling, to as low as 4 and 61%, respectively. Notable increases in both thermal and chemical stability were observed. When assessed electrochemically, these trends were further highlighted: ex-situ proton conductivity showed a stepwise increase in membrane performance with increasing degrees of branching, up to 212 mS cm−1 at 80 °C and 95% RH. Finally, in-situ characterizations of membranes integrated into hydrogen fuel cells showed state-of-the-art hydrocarbon membrane performance, comparing favorably to the archetypal Nafion 21 under H2/O2 at both 100% and 50% RH, and outperforming it by as much as 18% in maximum power density under H2/Air at 100% RH.",2020-02-01,Journal of Membrane Science,https://openalex.org/V119469986,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117539,117539,117539,595,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979748179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117539,journal-article,2979748179

Since approximately 88% of fatal overdoses in the province occur indoors, OPS have been integrated into select non-profit-operated single room accommodations (SRA) housing. We examined the social-structural features of these housing-based OPS (HOPS) on women's overdose risk. Methods Ethnographic research was conducted from May 201 to December 201 in Vancouver. Data included 3 in-depth interviews with women who use drugs living in SRAs and approximately 100 h of observational fieldwork in SRAs and surrounding areas. Data were analyzed using an intersectional risk environment approach, with attention to equity and violence. Findings Findings demonstrate that the social and structural environments of HOPS created barriers for women to access these interventions, resulting in an increased overdose risk. Primary barriers included uncertainty as to who else was accessing HOPS, rules prohibiting smoking, and a lack of trust in staff's abilities to effectively respond to an overdose. Most participants considered HOPS to be unsafe environments, and expressed fear of violence from residents and/or guests. The perceived risk of violence was informed by previous experiences of assault and the witnessing of violence. Many participants thus consumed drugs alone in their rooms to better control their safety, despite heightened overdose risk. Further, most participants did not perceive themselves to be at risk of an overdose due to drug use practices and tolerance levels, and viewed using alone as a safer option than HOPS. Conclusion Findings highlight how the low-barrier design and operation of HOPS can undermine women's engagement with HOPS. Overdose prevention strategies in SRAs should also include gender-specific models (e.g. women-only HOPS, women peer workers) to help mitigate barriers to these services within the context of the current overdose crisis.",2020-02-01,International Journal of Drug Policy,https://openalex.org/V60503757,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.102641,102641,102641,76,,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997177964,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.102641,journal-article,2997177964

These solutions commonly assume that soils are isotropic and elastic. Incorporation of anisotropy and the two-phased nature of soils (solid skeleton with pores filled with water) is important in the study of dynamic response of foundations. This paper presents the explicit analytical solutions for a transversely isotropic poroelastic soil half-space under a buried time-harmonic vertical load and a time-harmonic pore pressure discontinuity. These versatile fundamental solutions are derived by using Hankel integral transforms. They can be used to analyze a variety of dynamic problems in geomechanics. The fundamental solutions are then applied to solve the time-harmonic vertical vibration of a flexible circular foundation by using variational methods.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes-associated arrhythmias are unclear. We hypothesized that high glucose could adversely affect Nav 1.5, the major cardiac sodium channel isoform of the heart, at least partially via oxidative stress. We further hypothesized that cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main constituents of Cannabis sativa, through its effects on Nav 1.5, could protect against high glucose-elicited oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH To test these ideas, we used CHO cells transiently co-transfected with cDNA encoding human Nav 1.5 α-subunit under control and high glucose conditions (50 or 10 mM for 2 hr). Several experimental and computational techniques were used, including voltage clamp of heterologous expression systems, cell viability assays, fluorescence assays and action potential modelling. KEY RESULTS High glucose evoked cell death associated with elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) right shifted the voltage dependence of conductance and steady-state fast inactivation, and increased persistent current leading to computational prolongation of action potential (hyperexcitability) which could result in long QT3 arrhythmia. CBD mitigated all the deleterious effects provoked by high glucose. Perfusion with lidocaine (a well-known sodium channel inhibitor with antioxidant effects) or co-incubation of Tempol (a well-known antioxidant) elicited protection, comparable to CBD, against the deleterious effects of high glucose. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS These findings suggest that, through its favourable antioxidant and sodium channel inhibitory effects, CBD may protect against high glucose-induced arrhythmia and cytotoxicity.",2020-07-01,British Journal of Pharmacology,https://openalex.org/V55107261,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15020,2932,2946,177,13,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008288604,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15020,journal-article,3008288604

Although many people work toward overall drug abstinence while on methadone, a sub-population of people with and without histories of polysubstance use engage in stimulant use while on methadone treatment. This study explores motivations for concurrent stimulant and methadone use in a street-involved drug-using population. Design and methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 39 people on methadone in Vancouver, Canada. Participants were recruited from among the participants in two community-based prospective cohort studies consisting of HIV-positive and HIV-negative people who use drugs. Interview transcripts were analysed using an inductive and iterative approach. Results Our analysis identified three primary themes. First, participants articulated how stimulants were used to counter the sedating effects of methadone and enable them to engage in daily and survival activities (e.g. income generation). Second, participants described increased stimulant use to compensate for reduced stimulant intoxication while taking methadone. Finally, participants described the desire to achieve intoxication on stimulants once stable on methadone, as their substance use treatment goals did not involve drug abstinence. Discussion and conclusion Among a street-involved drug-using population in which people do not have abstinence-based treatment goals, there are several functional reasons to use stimulants concurrently while on methadone. A deeper and more nuanced understanding of substance use motivators may contribute to further research and inform policy and guideline changes that support low threshold and harm reduction-focused methadone treatment programs and other interventions to reduce drug-related harms.",2020-03-01,Drug and Alcohol Review,https://openalex.org/V134936136,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13049,209,215,39,3,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012836820,https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13049,journal-article,3012836820

This study examines associations between lifestyle behavioral factors and multimorbidity resilience (MR) among older adults. Methods: Using baseline data from the Comprehensive Cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, we studied 6,771 Canadian adults aged 6 or older who reported two or more of 2 chronic conditions, and three multimorbidity clusters: cardiovascular/metabolic, osteo-related, and mental health. Associations were explored using hierarchical linear regression modeling, controlling for sociodemographic, social/environmental, and illness context covariates. Results: Among older adults with two or more illnesses, as well as the cardiovascular/metabolic and osteo-related illness clusters, having a non-obese body mass, being a non-smoker, satisfaction with quality of sleep, having a good appetite, and not skipping meals are associated with MR. However, the mental-health cluster resulted in different behavioral lifestyle associations, where MR was not associated with obesity, smoking, or appetite, but inactivity demonstrated moderate positive associations with MR. Discussion: While there are similar patterns of lifestyle behaviors across multimorbidity and multimorbidity clusters involving physiological chronic illnesses, those associated with mental health are distinct.

Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. METHODS Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3 years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5 years. RESULTS Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score < 20) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD. Investigating individual skill areas (e.g., fine motor and nonverbal problem-solving skills), rather than broader indices of developmental level (e.g., nonverbal IQ) may provide important cues to understanding longer-term language outcomes that can be targeted in early intervention.",2020-07-01,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V177929781,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,826,835,61,7,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969389783,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13117,journal-article,2969389783

Based on a conceptual review, we posit that four distinct collective actors engage in learning in transitions: technology constituencies, epistemic communities, instrument constituencies, and advocacy coalitions. Technology constituencies promote the adoption of specific socio-technical alternatives by citizens, businesses, or governments. Epistemic communities shed light on sustainability issues at the science-policy interface. Instrument constituencies promote the creation and diffusion of specific governance arrangements. Advocacy coalitions compete politically to implement their policy preferences. These collective actors are responsible for facilitating technological learning, sustainability problem learning, policy instrumental learning, and political learning, respectively, which are in turn necessary for niche development, regime destabilization, overcoming path dependence, and political change. Consequently, the alignment of these distinct, albeit potentially overlapping, collective actors can have a profound impact on learning in transitions and the emergence of transition pathways.",2020-03-01,Environmental innovation and societal transitions,https://openalex.org/V2764720322,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2019.09.002,311,321,34,,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975064031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2019.09.002,journal-article,2975064031

We analyzed the future development of energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with road transportation. First, a Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) was developed to explore the internal relations of total demand, structure, and technology as factors impacting the road transportation system. Second, the core influence factors were screened using path analysis. Finally, a scenario analysis model was established to analyze potential energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction under different conditions. The results show that total demand has the largest direct effect among all influencing factors; however, if we consider indirect influences arising from interactions between latent variables, then traffic structure becomes the most important factor with a combined impact coefficient of −1.63. The respective potential energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction of road transportation are projected to be approximately 65,237.61 ktoe (37.33% rate) and 4 million tons (8.38%) during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016–2020) and reach approximately 91,923.63 ktoe (51.67%) and 6 million tons (12.66%) by 2025.

Here, we developed an ecological trait model to predict the categorical conservation status of 2 Northeast Atlantic and 1 Mediterranean Sea Data Deficient sharks and rays. We first developed an explanatory cumulative link mixed model based on regionally data-sufficient species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species™ using maximum body size, median depth, and reproductive mode, then predicted the statuses of Data Deficient species. Species exclusive to the Mediterranean were 3.8 times more likely to be threatened than species exclusive to the Northeast Atlantic. Over half of Northeast Atlantic (55%, n = 1 of 22), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (62%, n =  of 13) Data Deficient species were predicted to be threatened. When applied to all data-sufficient species, the mean predictive accuracy was 71% and 66% for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean models, respectively.

Lung cancer is one of the most highly frequent cancer subtypes, which is hard to be early diagnosed and monitored by radiological and histopathological evaluation that are the most general and accurate methods. Circulating miRNA is a potential clinical examination index for tumor detection and monitoring tumorigenesis progression using liquid biopsy. However, recognizing and validating the unique clinical values of each candidate circulating miRNA is expensive and time consuming. In this study, we presented a novel computational approach for identifying significant circulating miRNAs that may be applied to early screening, diagnosis, and constant monitoring of lung cancer progression. This approach incorporated several machine learning algorithms and was applied on the expression profiles of circulating miRNAs on lung cancer patients and control samples. In brief, a powerful feature selection method, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, was adopted to evaluate the importance of all features, resulting in a feature list. Then, incremental feature selection incorporating random forest followed to extract key circulating miRNAs. At the same time, an efficient classifier with MCC 0.740 was built. Top five circulating miRNAs, including miR-92a, miR-140-5p, miR-331-3p, miR-223, miR-374a, were analyzed and confirmed that they participated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, indicating their significant prognosis power in lung cancer. • A computational analysis was performed on circulating miRNAs profiles of lung cancer. • Machine learning methods were used for classification and key feature extraction. • Potential small RNA liquid biopsy markers for lung cancer were extracted. • The clinical correlation and prognosis evaluation power of markers can be confirmed. • An efficient classifier was built for lung cancer patient prognosis.",2020-10-01,Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta: Molecular Basis Of Disease,https://openalex.org/V4210173099,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165847,165847,165847,1866,10,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031247397,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165847,journal-article,3031247397

As such, in this study, we compared the predictive validity of SAVRY Protective Total and YLS/CMI Strength Total, and tested conceptual models of how these measures operate (i.e., risk vs. protective effects, direct vs. buffering effects, causal models). Research assistants conducted 62 risk assessments with 15 youth on probation. They rated protective factors at baseline, and again at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up periods. The SAVRY Protective Total and YLS/CMI Strength Total inversely predicted any charges in the subsequent  years (area under the curve scores = 0.61 and 0.60, respectively, p &lt; .05). Furthermore, when adolescents’ protective total scores increased, their self-reported violence decreased, thus providing evidence that these factors might play a causally relevant role in reducing violence. However, protective factors did not provide incremental validity over risk factors. In addition, because these measures are brief and use a dichotomous rating system, they primarily captured deficits in protective factors (i.e., low scores).

High power setups produce a lot of heat which has to be transported through the cell, making heat management essential. Knowing thermal conductivity values of the employed materials is crucial when modeling the temperature distribution inside an electrolyzer. The thermal conductivity was measured for different titanium-based porous transport layers (PTL) and a partially methylated Hexamethyl-p-Terphenyl Polybenzimidazolium (HMT-PMBI-Cl- membrane. The four titanium-based sintered transport layers materials have thermal conductivities between 1.0 and 2.5 ± 0.2 WK−1m−1 at 10 bar compaction pressure. The HMT-PMBI-Cl- membrane has a thermal conductivity of 0.1 ± 0.04 WK−1m−1 at 0% relative humidity at 10 bar compaction pressure and 0.2 ± 0.03 WK−1m−1 at 100% relative humidity ( λ = 12 water molecules per ion exchange site at room temperature) at 10 bar compaction pressure. Combining the determined thermal conductivity values with data from the literature, 2D thermal models of a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) were built to evaluate the temperature distribution in the through-plane direction.

The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate how the Challenge Hypothesis has shaped ideas about human life histories. We conduct a citation analysis, drawing upon 400 Google Scholar citations in the human literature to identify patterns in this body of scholarship. We cover key factors, such as context and personality traits, that help explain variable testosterone responses such as winning/losing to adult competitive behavior. Findings from studies on courtship and sexual behavior indicate some variation in testosterone responses depending on factors such as motivation. A large body of research indicates that male testosterone levels are often lower in contexts of long-term committed partnerships and nurturant fathering and aligned with variation in male mating and parenting effort. As the Challenge Hypothesis is extended across the life course, DHEA and androstenedione (rather than testosterone) appear more responsive to juvenile male competitive behavior, and during reproductive senescence, baseline male testosterone levels decrease just as male life history allocations show decreased mating effort. We discuss how research on testosterone administration, particularly in older men, provides causal insight into effects of testosterone in humans, and how this natural experiment can be viewed in light of the Challenge Hypothesis.

The stream power law appears to explain rates of rock incision at large scale (large drainage basins or landscape scale), but appears to be of limited value in predicting reach-scale morphology and dynamics. The underlying reason why stream power is such an effective tool for understanding landscape evolution is because it is an explicit representation of the inverse power relation between slope and area in rivers incising bedrock. This morphometric relation is nearly universal, subject to exogenous contingencies. Independent testing and validation of the stream power incision model is challenging because of the contingencies that exist in almost all landscapes. Mechanistic models of erosion have been tested and validated at small scales, generally below the reach scale, and opportunities exist for independent testing and validation by using them to predict reach-scale morphologies. Predicting larger scale bedrock river morphology requires the assumption that flow, sediment fluxes and bedrock erosion processes that occur at smaller scale are adequately averaged at larger scales, which is not well supported. Reconciling these two scales of explanation is one of the grand challenges of fluvial geomorphology, unless we accept that theory and explanations will be scale-delimited.",2020-10-01,Geomorphology,https://openalex.org/V203530175,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.07.004,106817,106817,366,,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2961973674,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.07.004,journal-article,2961973674

Undergraduates (N = 424) enrolled in  universities from  countries read a refutation text on genetically modified foods (GMFs) and were then randomly assigned to receive additional information about advantages of GMFs, disadvantages of GMFs, or both. After studying, students reading about advantages of GMFs had significantly more positive attitudes than students who read about disadvantages. There was also a significant reduction in misconceptions; participants in the positive-oriented text condition showed the largest learning gains, particularly those who held more positive initial attitudes. Epistemic emotions of curiosity, frustration, hope, and enjoyment mediated attitude change while confusion mediated relations between prereading attitudes and postreading knowledge. In addition, the direct relationship between prior attitudes and surprise was moderated by type of text. When reading about both advantages and disadvantages of GMFs, participants reported significantly less surprise when compared with those who read about either advantages or disadvantages of GMFs.

This paper studies the practically important problem of unknown tag detection. Existing solutions either require low-cost tags to perform complex operations or beget a long detection time. To this end, we propose the Collision-Seeking Detection (CSD) protocol, in which the server finds out a collision-seed to make massive known tags hash-collide in the last $N$ slots of a time frame with size $f$ . Thus, all the leading ${f-N}$ pre-empty slots become useful for detection of unknown tags. A challenging issue is that, computation cost for finding the collision-seed is very huge. Hence, we propose a supplementary protocol called Balanced Group Partition (BGP), which divides tag population into $n$ small groups. The group number $n$ is able to trade off between communication cost and computation cost. We also give theoretical analysis to investigate the parameters to ensure the required detection accuracy. The major advantages of our CSD+BGP are two-fold: (i) it only requires tags to perform lightweight operations, which are widely used in classical framed slotted Aloha algorithms. Thus, it is more suitable for low-cost tags; (ii) it is more time-efficient to detect the unknown tags. Simulation results reveal that CSD+BGP can ensure the required detection accuracy, meanwhile achieving $1.7\times $ speedup in the single-reader scenarios and $3.9\times $ speedup in the multi-reader scenarios than the state-of-the-art detection protocol.",2020-01-01,IEEE ACM Transactions on Networking,https://openalex.org/V62238642,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2019.2957239,126,139,28,1,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996867862,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2019.2957239,journal-article,2996867862

Cryptobenthic reef fishes account for approximately half of all reef fish species and are an abundant and important group on coral reefs worldwide. Yet, due to their small size and inconspicuous lifestyles, relatively little is known about the ecological niches of most cryptobenthic species. Here, we use gut content DNA metabarcoding to determine dietary niche overlap and prey richness in four sympatric species of cryptobenthic reef fishes in two genera (Acanthemblemaria aspera, A. spinosa, Enneanectes altivelis, and E. matador). Furthermore, we test whether dietary differentiation corresponds with differences in species distribution patterns across twelve sites on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef in Belize. Our approach reveals dietary partitioning among the four species, which is further supported by low edge density and high modularity in the resulting trophic network. A. spinosa and E. matador consume a significantly higher richness of prey items than their congeners. This result corresponds with non-random distributions and co-occurrence patterns in both species pairs: the two high prey richness species (A. spinosa and E. matador) co-occur more frequently than predicted by chance, but they are exclusive to exposed forereef sites with high wave action. In contrast, their congeners occur across exposed forereef and sheltered backreef sites, but they do not increase in numbers at sheltered sites. Our findings suggest that A. spinosa and E. matador monopolize a wide variety of prey in exposed habitats, but they are unable to meet the energetic demands of their adaptation to high-flow habitats in sheltered areas, possibly due to lower prey availability. This, in turn, indicates strong ecological differentiation among closely related species of cryptobenthic fishes, driven by links between diet, physiology, prey availability, and wave exposure.",2020-04-01,Coral Reefs,https://openalex.org/V130807758,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01892-z,305,317,39,2,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003714816,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01892-z,journal-article,3003714816

Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010–2019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement.

While humans undeniably caused the extinction, the relative importance of indirect (habitat destruction) versus direct (overhunting) impacts has remained a mystery, in part, due to a lack of scientific evidence for critical aspects of the species’ dietary ecology. One key factor in explaining why passenger pigeons went extinct is that their highly specialized diet and foraging strategy, focusing on mast (tree nuts), were no longer feasible as the forested habitats that they depended on became depleted by deforestation. We used stable isotope ( δ 1 C and δ 1 N, n = 94) and ancient DNA ( n = 9) analyses of archaeological specimens to demonstrate that, during the later Holocene, passenger pigeons had a substantial degree of dietary plasticity (including some individuals specializing in consumption of agricultural crops) that could have allowed them to take advantage of other food opportunities when mast became scarce. Dietary variation is not linked with either biological age (juveniles versus adults) or haplogroup. These results suggest that habitat destruction was less important for the passenger pigeon’s extinction than the impacts of hunting and trapping and highlight the tremendous potential of the archaeological record for exploring the factors that led to this species’ extinction. • Multiple modes of dietary specialization identified in passenger pigeons. • Dietary specialization not linked to biological age or genetic haplogroup. • Suggests direct exploitation, not habitat destruction, is primary cause of extinction. • In contrast to earlier claims, passenger pigeons abundant in archaeological record. • Archaeological samples provide new insights into passenger pigeon ecology/extinction.",2020-04-01,Quaternary Science Reviews,https://openalex.org/V81424476,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106225,106225,106225,233,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006986593,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106225,journal-article,3006986593

Here we adapt the HyperTRIBE method using an RBP fused to a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme (ADAR) to globally map the mRNA targets of the RBP MSI2 in mammalian adult normal and malignant stem cells. We reveal a unique MUSASHI-2 (MSI2) mRNA binding network in hematopoietic stem cells that changes during transition to multipotent progenitors. Additionally, we discover a significant increase in RNA binding activity of MSI2 in leukemic stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in selective regulation of MSI2’s oncogenic targets. This provides a basis for MSI2 increased dependency in leukemia cells compared to normal cells. Moreover, our study provides a way to measure RBP function in rare cells and suggests that RBPs can achieve differential binding activity during cell state transition independent of gene expression.",2020-04-24,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15814-8,,,11,1,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018777550,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15814-8,journal-article,3018777550

Little research has explored the types of policies needed to achieve 2050 GHG mitigation goals in the land freight sector, i.e., 80% reductions from 200 levels. We use a behaviourally-realistic technology-adoption model (CIMS-Freight) to simulate the GHG impacts of several climate policies, individually and in combinations, on the land freight sector (trucking and rail). Results indicate that current policies in Canada (including standards and carbon pricing) will not achieve GHG reduction targets for this sector – in fact, emissions continue to rise. Further, no individual policy has a high probability of achieving 203 or 2050 GHG targets, including more stringent versions of the carbon tax, fuel efficiency standards, low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS), or a zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate for trucks. Finally, we identify several policy combinations that have a high probability of achieving 2050 goals, in particular a stringent ZEV mandate for trucks complemented by a stringent LCFS.

Sea-level records from the Indian Ocean over the past 2,000 years are sparse, while records from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans show variations less than 0.25 m and no significant negative excursions. Here, we present evidence of two low sea-level phases in the Maldives, Indian Ocean, based on fossil coral microatolls. Microatoll growth is constrained by low water levels and, consequently, they are robust recorders of past sea level. U–Th dating of the Maldivian corals identified lowstands at ad 234–605 and ad 1481–1807 when sea level fell to maximum depths of −0.88 m and −0.89 m respectively. These lowstands are synchronous with reductions in radiative forcing and sea surface temperature associated with the Late Antiquity Little Ice Age and the Little Ice Age. Our results provide high-fidelity observations of lower sea levels during these cool periods and show rates of change of up to 4.24 mm yr−1. Our data also confirm the acceleration of relative sea-level rise over the past two centuries and suggest that the current magnitude and rate of sea-level rise is not unprecedented.

We focus on setups that provide full control over the form of the potential-energy landscape and derive protocols that minimize the average work needed to erase the bit over a fixed amount of time. We allow for cases where only some of the information encoded in the bit is erased. For systems required to end up in a local equilibrium state, we calculate the minimum amount of work needed to erase a bit explicitly, in terms of the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the system's initial potential. The minimum work is inversely proportional to the duration of the protocol. The erasure cost may be further reduced by relaxing the requirement for a local-equilibrium final state and allowing for any final distribution compatible with constraints on the probability to be in each memory macrostate. We also derive upper and lower bounds on the erasure cost.",2020-09-03,Physical review,https://openalex.org/V4210235286,,https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.102.032105,,,102,3,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033537376,https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.102.032105,journal-article,3033537376

Logistic regression, however, often performs poorly when trained on data that is noisy, has irrelevant features, or when the samples are distributed across the classes in an imbalanced setting; a common occurrence in visual recognition tasks. To deal with those issues, researchers generally rely on adhoc regularization techniques or model a subset of these issues. We instead propose a mathematically sound logistic regression model that selects a subset of (relevant) features and (informative and balanced) set of samples during the training process. The model does so by applying cardinality constraints (via ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">0</sub> -`norm' sparsity) on the features and samples. ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">0</sub> defines sparsity in mathematical settings but in practice has mostly been approximated (e.g., via ℓ <sub xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sub> or its variations) for computational simplicity.

Still, both the uni-directional and bi-directional predictions are possible using the proposed DNN, which is enabled by the use of the temporal index channel, in addition to the color channels. In this paper, we developed a jointly trained DNN for both uni-directional and bi-directional predictions, as well as separate networks for uni-directional and bi-directional predictions, and compared the efficacy of both the approaches. The proposed DNNs were compared with the conventional motion-compensated prediction in the latest video coding standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), in terms of the BD-bitrate. The experiments show that the proposed joint DNN (for both uni-directional and bi-directional predictions) reduces the luminance bitrate by about 4.4%, 2.4%, and 2.3% in the low delay $P$ , low delay, and random access configurations, respectively.

In this paper, the all-electric GEO satellite MDO problem with multi-fidelity models is investigated. The MDO problem involving six inter-coupled disciplines is formulated to minimize the total mass of the satellite system subject to a number of engineering constraints. To reduce the computational cost of the multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) process, multi-fidelity transfer dynamics models and finite element analysis (FEA) models are developed for the geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) and structure disciplines, respectively. To effectively solve the all-electric GEO satellite MDO problem using multi-fidelity models, an adaptive Co-Kriging-based optimization framework is proposed. In this framework, the samples from a high-fidelity MDA process are integrated with those from a low-fidelity MDA process to create a Co-Kriging metamodel with a moderate computational cost for optimization. Besides, for refining the Co-Kriging metamodels, a multi-objective adaptive infill sampling approach is developed to produce the infill sample points in terms of the expected improvement (EI) and the probability of feasibility (PF) functions. Optimization results show that the proposed optimization framework can significantly reduce the total mass of satellite system with a limited computational budget, which demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the multi-fidelity modeling and adaptive Co-Kriging-based optimization framework for all-electric GEO satellite systems design.",2020-02-01,Journal of Mechanical Design,https://openalex.org/V88457320,,https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4044321,,,142,2,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2964033023,https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4044321,journal-article,2964033023

Hormones mediate developmental plasticity, the changes in the phenotype that occur during ontogeny. Despite their highly conserved functions, the flexibilities of human hormonal systems suggest a strong history of adaptation to variable environments. Physiological research on developmental plasticity has focused on the early programming effects of stress, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) during critical periods, when the hormones produced have the strongest influence on the developing brain. Often this research emphasizes the maladaptive effects of early stressful experiences. Here we posit that the HPAA and HPAG systems in human developmental plasticity have evolved to be responsive to complex and dynamic problems associated with human sociality. The lengthy period of human offspring dependency, and its associated brain development and risks, is linked to the uniquely human combination of stable breeding bonds, extensive paternal effort in a multi-male group, extended bilateral kin recognition, grandparenting, and controlled exchange of mates among kin groups. We evaluate an evolutionary framework that integrates proximate physiological explanations with ontogeny, phylogeny, adaptive function, and comparative life history data. • Hormones are important mediators of life-history tradeoffs. • Humans have an unusually long period of growth and development, lasting for almost two decades, that has inherent risks. • During development, in correlation with several neuroendocrine events, multiple sensitive periods of plasticity have evolved, each uniquely responsive to specific social cues that we suggest were relevant during human evolution. • The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the hypothalamus-pituitarygonadal axis (HPGA) are key parts of the neuroendocrine system, both regulating human phenotypic plasticity. • Epigenetic mechanisms act as integrators of past and present information relevant to human reproductive strategies through the functions of the HPAA and HPGA.",2020-04-05,Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V191044671,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.110721,110721,110721,505,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004381670,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.110721,journal-article,3004381670

This paper surveys recent evidence and identifies empirical patterns in the economic diversification of resource-rich countries. Diversification is measured using the growth of per capita non-resource (manufacturing and services) sectors in domestic and export markets, which has a cleaner interpretation than competing measures. This measure is used to evaluate the long-term diversification of countries that started off as resource-dependent, and to rank countries according to their performance. We then identify policy-relevant correlates of diversification at the national level, including the acquisition of human capital, public and intellectual capital, and firm dynamism. More resource-dependent countries appear to perform worse on measures of human capital and intellectual capital, but more resource-abundant countries perform better on public capital and human capital accumulation.

Here, we aim to investigate how local connectivity and its age-related trajectories vary with ASD in both males and females. We used resting-state fMRI data from the ABIDE I and II repository: males (n = 102) and females (n = 92) with ASD, and typically developing males (n = 104) and females (n = 92) aged between 6 and 26.

We found increases in local connectivity in participants with ASD in the somatomotor and limbic networks and decreased local connectivity within the default mode network. These alterations were more pronounced in females with ASD. In addition, the association between local connectivity and ASD symptoms was more robust in females. Females with ASD had the most distinct developmental trajectories of local connectivity compared with other groups.

The British Columbia Pacific halibut fishery has long been held up as an example of successful ITQ management. An in-depth investigation of this fishery, however, has identified significant failings of the ITQ system. The ownership profile of the fishery has changed dramatically under ITQs, transitioning from predominantly owner-operated to absentee owners and lessee fishermen. An analysis of fishing enterprise financial performance demonstrates the overwhelming impact of leasing on the viability of fishing enterprises. A representative owner-operator fishing enterprise leasing more than 80% of the quota that it fishes, which characterizes all of the owner-operators that have entered the fishery since 2001, cannot earn enough from the fishery to re-invest, including replacement of the vessel or purchasing of quota. The fishery, under current leasing and purchase price conditions, is not self-sustaining as an owner-operator fishery. Socio-economic objectives for the fishery are not being met, raising important questions about the design and implementation of ITQ management systems.",2020-01-01,Marine Policy,https://openalex.org/V56205983,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103718,103718,103718,111,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985729429,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103718,journal-article,2985729429

Evidence from global nighttime light data,"Abstract The capability of High-Speed Rail (HSR) to influence urban development has received considerable attention. However, due to lack of statistical data, there are few studies examining HSR-led urban development from a national perspective. Using the brightness of nighttime lights as a proxy for economic development, this manuscript begins to offer a more complete picture of development around 124 HSR station areas in China. Moreover, the manuscript explores the causes of different development patterns among China's HSR station areas. Empirical results reveal three main findings. 1) HSR station areas with high nighttime light brightness are mainly located in Beijing, Tianjin, Yangtze River delta city cluster and Pearl River delta city cluster. HSR station areas with relatively rapid growth in nighttime light brightness are mostly distributed in Hebei province, Henan province and Anhui province. 2) The level of urban economic development, the level of city rank and the location of HSR stations are three important factors affecting the development of HSR station areas. 3) The factors affecting the development of new and existing HSR station areas are distinct from one another. The influence of the overall urban economic development level on the development of new HSR station areas is larger than such influence on existing station areas where HSR has been added to existing infrastructure. The level of city ranking and the location of HSR stations significantly affect the development around new HSR stations, but have no significant impact on the development surrounding pre-existing HSR stations.",2020-02-01,Cities,https://openalex.org/V137445289,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.102568,102568,102568,97,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995684151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.102568,journal-article,2995684151

However, little efforts have been devoted to unveil structural interaction between nanoparticles and substrate and understand the underlying kinetic mechanism for hydrogen sorption. In this work, a suite of TiO2 nanoparticles decorated graphene oxide (GO) composites is fabricated and characterized to determine the interactions between material structure and hydrogen storage kinetics. EELS and XPS results show that interactions between nanoparticles and GO cause changes of the chemical states of C–O, C O and C–OH groups; furthermore, reactions of C–OH, HO–C O and C–O–C groups with TiO2 nanoparticles create C–Ti and Ti–O–C bonding. Decoration of TiO2 nanoparticles improves the capacity of GO by 2.3×, and 80% of the adsorption is reversible. By means of semi-empirical kinetic analysis, it is determined that hydrogen adsorption is controlled by two-dimensional diffusion regardless of layer spacing; while desorption is controlled by multiple diffusion processes and is sensitive to layer spacing. Collectively, these new findings deepen the understanding of transition metal nanoparticles decorated GO materials in the aspects of nanoparticle incorporation and hydrogen storage kinetic mechanism. In particular, oxygen groups enhance nanoparticle decoration, while high layer spacing improves desorption kinetics and reversibility.",2020-02-28,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,https://openalex.org/V48860480,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.12.095,6713,6726,45,11,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998878723,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.12.095,journal-article,2998878723

However, predictions and evidence from the kinship theory of imprinting have yet to be directly integrated with data on fetal programming and risks of metabolic disease. I first define paternal-gene and maternal-gene optima with regard to early human growth and development. Next, I review salient evidence with regard to imprinted gene effects on birth weight, body composition, trajectories of feeding and growth, and timing of developmental stages, to evaluate why and how imprinted gene expression influences risks of metabolic disease in later life. I find that metabolic disease risks derive primarily from maternal gene biases that lead to reduced placental efficacy, low birth weight, low relative muscle mass, high relative white fat, increased abdominal adiposity, reduced pancreatic β-cell mass that promotes insulin resistance, reduced appetite and infant sucking efficacy, catch-up fat deposition from family foods after weaning, and early puberty. Paternal gene biases, by contrast, may contribute to metabolic disease via lower rates of brown fat thermiogenesis, and through favoring more rapid postnatal catch-up growth after intrauterine growth restriction from environmental causes. These disease risks can be alleviated through dietary and pharmacological alterations that selectively target imprinted gene expression and relevant metabolic pathways. The kinship theory of imprinting, and mother-offspring conflict more generally, provide a clear predictive framework for guiding future research on fetal programming and metabolic disease.",2020-01-24,Frontiers in Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V2597401208,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00940,,,10,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003079370,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00940,journal-article,3003079370

However, the one-compartment toxicokinetic model that is used in the guidelines to analyze the results from dietary bioaccumulation tests is not consistent with the current state of the science, experimental practices, and information needs for bioaccumulation and risk assessment. The present study presents 1) a 2-compartment toxicokinetic modeling framework for describing the bioaccumulation of neutral hydrophobic organic chemicals in fish and 2) an associated toxicokinetic analysis tool (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [ADME] B calculator) for the analysis and interpretation of dietary bioaccumulation test data from OECD-305 dietary tests. The model framework and ADME-B calculator are illustrated by analysis of fish dietary bioaccumulation test data for 23 substances representing different structural classes and susceptibilities to biotransformation. The ADME of the chemicals is determined from dietary bioaccumulation tests and bioconcentration factors, biomagnification factors, and somatic and intestinal biotransformation rates. The 2-compartment fish toxicokinetic model can account for the effect of the exposure pathway on bioaccumulation, which the one-compartment model cannot. This insight is important for applying a weight-of-evidence approach to bioaccumulation assessment where information from aqueous and dietary test endpoints can be integrated to improve the evaluation of a chemical's bioaccumulation potential.

We quantified urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites that were detected in > 70% of urine samples collected during the first trimester. Gestational age was obtained from either the last menstrual period or early ultrasound. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the associations of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations, plus the molar sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP), with time to delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. We also examined PTB by clinical presentation. PTBs presented with either spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membrane were considered spontaneous PTB (sPTB).

We decompose the illumination into two channels: the step shading, corresponding to the sharp shading changes due to cast shadow or abrupt shape changes; the drift shading, accounting for the smooth shading variations due to gradual illumination changes or slow shape changes. Due to such transformation of turning the conventional assumption that shading has smoothness as reasonable prior, our model has the advantages in handling real images, especially with the cast shadows or strong shape edges. We also apply a much stricter edge classifier along with a reinforcement process to enhance our method.

Bowel care is a potential trigger for autonomic dysreflexia (AD; paroxysmal hypertension elicited by sensory stimuli below the level of lesion). AD can be life threatening so strategies to minimise AD are prioritised after SCI. Lidocaine lubricant is recommended during bowel care with the rationale to minimise the sensory stimulus, reducing AD. The objective of this study was to assess whether lidocaine lubricant (Xylocaine 2%) ameliorates AD during at-home bowel care compared with standard lubricant (placebo).Community.Participants (n = 13; age 44.0 ± 3. years) with high-level SCI (C3-T4) performed their normal at-home bowel care on two days, each time using a different lubricant, with continuous non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring. Injury to spinal autonomic (sympathetic) nerves was determined from low-frequency systolic arterial pressure (LF SAP) variability.Participants displayed reduced autonomic function (LF SAP 3.0 ± 0.8 mmHg2), suggesting impaired autonomic control. Bowel care duration was increased with lidocaine (79.1 ± 10.0 min) compared to placebo (57.7 ± 6.3 min; p = 0.018). All participants experienced AD on both days, but maximum SAP was higher with lidocaine (214.3 ± 10. mmHg) than placebo (196.7 ± 10.0 mmHg; p = 0.046). Overall, SAP was higher for longer with lidocaine (6.5 × 105 ± 0. × 105 mmHg • beat) than placebo (4.4 × 105 ± 0. × 105 mmHg • beat; p = 0.018) indicating a higher burden of AD. Heart rate and rhythm disturbances were increased during AD, particularly with lidocaine use.At-home bowel care was a potent trigger for AD. Our findings contradict recommendations for lidocaine use during bowel care, suggesting that anaesthetic lubricants impair reflex bowel emptying, resulting in longer care routines with an increased burden of AD.",2020-04-01,Spinal Cord,https://openalex.org/V95854419,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-019-0381-2,430,440,58,4,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990866468,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-019-0381-2,journal-article,2990866468

This bacterial transfer process depends on the host actin cytoskeleton as the bacterium forms motile actin-rich membranous protrusions that propel the bacteria into neighboring cells, thus forming corresponding membrane invaginations. Here, we examine these membrane invaginations and demonstrate that caveolin-1–based endocytosis is crucial for efficient bacterial cell-to-cell spreading. We show that only a subset of caveolin-associated proteins (cavin-2 and EHD2) are involved in this process. Despite the absence of clathrin at the invaginations, the classical clathrin-associated protein epsin-1 is also required for efficient bacterial spreading. Using isolated L. monocytogenes protrusions added onto naive host cells, we demonstrate that actin-based propulsion is dispensable for caveolin-1 endocytosis as the presence of the protrusion/invagination interaction alone triggers caveolin-1 recruitment in the recipient cells.

Astronauts on-board the International Space Station (ISS) perform daily exercises designed to prevent muscle atrophy and bone demineralization: what is the effect of resistive exercise performed by subjects while exposed to the same level of hypercapnia as on the ISS on intraocular pressure (IOP)? What is the main finding and its importance? The static exercise-induced elevation in IOP during 6° prone head-down tilt (simulating the headward shift of body fluids in microgravity) is augmented by hypercapnia and exceeds the ocular hypertension threshold. ABSTRACT The present study assessed the effect of 6° head-down (establishing the cephalad fluid displacement noted in astronauts in microgravity) prone (simulating the effect on the eye) tilt during rest and exercise (simulating exercise performed by astronauts to mitigate the sarcopenia induced by unloading of weight-bearing limbs), in normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions (the latter simulating conditions on the International Space Station) on intraocular pressure (IOP). Volunteers (mean age = 57.8 ± 6 years, n = 10) participated in two experimental sessions, each comprising: (i) 10 min rest, (ii) 3 min static handgrip exercise (30% max), and (iii) 2 min recovery, inspiring either room air (NCAP) or a hypercapnic mixture (1% CO2 , HCAP). We measured IOP in the right eye, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at regular intervals. Baseline IOP in the upright seated position while breathing room air was 14.1 ± 2.9 mmHg. Prone 6° head-down tilt significantly (P < 0.01) elevated IOP in all three phases of the NCAP (rest: 27.0 ± 3.7 mmHg; exercise: 32.2 ± 4.8 mmHg; recovery: 27.4 ± 4.0 mmHg) and HCAP (rest: 27.3 ± 4.3 mmHg; exercise: 34.2 ± 6.0 mmHg; recovery: 29.1 ± 5.8 mmHg) trials, with hypercapnia augmenting the exercise-induced elevation in IOP (P < 0.01). CO, SV, HR and MAP were significantly increased during handgrip dynamometry, but there was no effect of hypercapnia. The observed IOP measured during prone 6° HDT in all phases of the NCAP and HCAP trials exceeded the threshold pressure defining ocular hypertension. The exercise-induced increase in IOP is exacerbated by hypercapnia.",2020-04-01,Experimental Physiology,https://openalex.org/V65894173,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088236,641,651,105,4,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005449882,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088236,journal-article,3005449882

We allowed laboratory-reared black blow flies, Phormia regina (Meigen), to feed and defecate on bacterial Luria-Bertani medium solidified with agar, and isolated seven morphologically distinct bacterial colonies. We identified these using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.

A mixture of seven bacterial strains as a trap bait was more attractive to flies than a single bacterial isolate (M. m. sibonii). In a field experiment, traps baited with agar cultures of P. mirabilis and M. m. sibonii in combination captured significantly more flies than traps baited with either bacterial isolate alone or the agar control. As evident by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the odor profiles of bacterial isolates differ, which may explain the additive effect of bacteria to the attractiveness of bacterial trap baits.

The cognitive profiles of individuals with ASD are varied, and the neurophysiological underpinnings of these developmental difficulties are unclear. While many studies have focused on overall group differences in the amplitude or latency of event related potential (ERP) responses, recent research suggests that increased intra-subject neural variability may also be a reliable indicator of atypical brain function in ASD. This study aimed to identify behavioral and neural variability responses during an emotional inhibitory control task in children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD showed increased variability in response to both inhibitory and emotional stimuli, evidenced by greater reaction time variability and single-trial ERP variability of N20 and N17 amplitudes and/or latencies compared to TD children.

In mammalian cells, human HIPK2 proteins accumulate posttranscriptionally upon OGT overexpression. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal that HIPK2 is at least O- GlcNAc modified at S852, T1009, and S1147 residues. Mutations of these residues reduce HIPK2 O -GlcNAcylation and stability.

There is a strong need for new nontoxic drugs with broad-spectrum activity against trypanosome parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma. A relatively untested approach is to target macromolecular interactions in parasites rather than small molecular interactions, under the hypothesis that the features specifying macromolecular interactions diverge more rapidly through coevolution. We computed tRNA Class-Informative Features in humans and independently in eight distinct clades of trypanosomes, identifying parasite-specific informative features, including base pairs and base mis-pairs, that are broadly conserved over approximately 250 million years of trypanosome evolution. Validating these observations, we demonstrated biochemically that tRNA:aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) interactions are a promising target for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery. From a marine natural products extract library, we identified several fractions with inhibitory activity toward Leishmania major alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) but no activity against the human homolog. These marine natural products extracts showed cross-reactivity towards Trypanosoma cruzi AlaRS indicating the broad-spectrum potential of our network predictions. We also identified Leishmania major threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) inhibitors from the same library.

Adequate antenatal care (ANC) is crucial in reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, in Rwanda, there is still suboptimal utilization of ANC services. This study aims to assess the relationship between perceived barriers to accessing health care and inadequate ANC visits among women of reproductive age in Rwanda. Methods This study is cross-sectional using secondary data from the 2014–15 Rwanda demographic and health survey (RDHS). The study included 587 women aged 15–49 years, and the primary outcome of the investigation was inadequate ANC visits defined as delayed first ANC visit and non-completion of at least four recommended visits during the pregnancy period. The primary exposure was perceived barriers to accessing health care, operationalized using the following  variables: distance to the health facility, getting money for treatment, not wanting to go alone and getting permission to go for treatment. A survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis and backward elimination method based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the final model. We conducted a number of sensitivity analyses using stratified and weighting propensity score methods and investigated the relationship between the outcome and each barrier to care separately. Results Of 5, 87 women included in the analysis, 53% (3132) aged 2 to 3 years, and 44% (2640) were in the lowest wealth index. Overall, 64% (2375) of women who perceived to have barriers to health care had inadequate ANC visits. In multivariable analysis, women who perceived to have barriers to health care had higher odds of having inadequate ANC visits (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.31). However, the association was borderline statistically significant. The findings from sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis results.

Bridging a massive amount of geo-distributed broadcasters and their fellow viewers, such representatives as Twitch.tv, Youtube Gaming, and Inke.tv, have greatly changed the generation and distribution landscape of streaming content. They also enable rich online interactions among the crowd, and strive to offer personalized Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for individual viewers. Given the ultra-large scale and the dynamics of the crowd, personalizing QoE however is much more challenging than in early generation streaming services. The rich interactions among the broadcasters, viewers, and the network system, on the other hand, also offer invaluable data that could be utilized towards informed management. This paper presents DeepCast , an edge-assisted crowdcast framework that explores the sheer amount of viewing data towards intelligent decisions for personalized QoE demands. DeepCast seamlessly integrates cloud, CDN, and edge servers for crowdcast content distribution, and advocates a data-driven design that extracts the hidden information from the complex interactions among the system components. Through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it automatically identifies the most suitable strategies for viewer assignment and transcoding at edges. We collect multiple real-world datasets and evaluate the performance of DeepCast with trace-driven experiments. The results demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness towards better personalized QoE and lower cost for crowdcast systems.",2020-03-25,IEEE ACM Transactions on Networking,https://openalex.org/V62238642,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2020.2979966,1255,1268,28,3,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014068862,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2020.2979966,journal-article,3014068862

Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at ~20 weeks gestation and up to seven times during postpartum visits (4 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years). We used linear mixed models to estimate covariate-adjusted associations between chemical concentrations and repeated measures of BDI-II. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the relative risk ratios of having a medium or high depression trajectory.We found that a 10-fold increase in BDE-28 at 16 ± 3 weeks gestation was associated with significantly increased BDI-II scores (β = 2.5 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8, 4.2) from pregnancy to 8 years postpartum.

Several LRAs that function as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are reported to reverse HIV latency in cells and in clinical trials; however, none to date have consistently reduced viral reservoirs in humans, prompting a need to identify new LRAs.

We focus on three regimes of land tenure: lawful possession, designated land and permits. These land regimes have been used to create individual landholdings and grant secure and transferable rights of use of reserve land. Using confidential census microdata and rich administrative data, we find evidence of a positive relationship between the use of these tenure regimes and homeownership rates, housing conditions and band's public spending. We also observe a positive relationship with average income. However, this last result is driven by the inflow of a non‐Indigenous population not by improvements in Indigenous households’ income or on‐reserve employment. Our findings thus suggest that while reforms to individual property rights on reserve have some positive effects, their scope remains limited and they are unlikely to constitute a transformative tool to alleviate poverty on reserve.

Although lithospheric extension has undoubtedly occurred in the region since 1 Ma, the geodynamic history of older, regional-scale, kyanite- and sillimanite-grade metamorphic rocks exposed within the core of the Naxos dome is controversial. Specifically, little is known about the pre-extensional prograde evolution and the relative timing of peak metamorphism in relation to the onset of extension. In this work, new structural mapping is presented and integrated with petrographic analyses and phase equilibrium modeling of blueschists, kyanite gneisses, and anatectic sillimanite migmatites. The kyanite-sillimanite–grade rocks within the core complex record a complex history of burial and compression and did not form under crustal extension. Deformation and metamorphism were diachronous and advanced down the structural section, resulting in the juxtaposition of several distinct tectono-stratigraphic nappes that experienced contrasting metamorphic histories. The Cycladic Blueschists attained ∼14.5 kbar and 47 °C during attempted northeast-directed subduction of the continental margin. These were subsequently thrusted onto the more proximal continental margin, resulting in crustal thickening and regional metamorphism associated with kyanite-grade conditions of ∼10 kbar and 600–670 °C. With continued shortening, the deepest structural levels underwent kyanite-grade hydrous melting at ∼8–10 kbar and 680–750 °C, followed by isothermal decompression through the muscovite dehydration melting reaction to sillimanite-grade conditions of ∼5–6 kbar and 73 °C. This decompression process was associated with top-to-the-NNE shearing along passive-roof faults that formed because of SW-directed extrusion. These shear zones predated crustal extension, because they are folded around the migmatite dome and are crosscut by leucogranites and low-angle normal faults. The migmatite dome formed at lower-pressure conditions under horizontal constriction that caused vertical boudinage and upright isoclinal folds. The switch from compression to extension occurred immediately following doming and was associated with NNE-SSW horizontal boudinage and top-to-the-NNE brittle-ductile normal faults that truncate the internal shear zones and earlier collisional features. The Naxos metamorphic core complex is interpreted to have formed via crustal thickening, regional metamorphism, and partial melting in a compressional setting, here termed the Aegean orogeny, and it was exhumed from the midcrust due to the switch from compression to extension at ca. 1 Ma.",2020-01-01,Geological Society of America Bulletin,https://openalex.org/V3271665,Geological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1130/b31978.1,149,197,132,1-2,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2948924952,https://doi.org/10.1130/b31978.1,journal-article,2948924952

Early forward and reverse genetic screens significantly benefited from the transparency of zebrafish embryos, allowing cardiac development as a function of genetics to be directly observed. However, gradual loss of transparency with subsequent maturation limited many of these approaches to the first several days post-fertilization. As many genes are developmentally regulated, the immature phenotype is not entirely indicative of that of the mature zebrafish. For accurate phenotyping, subsequent developmental stages including full maturation must also be considered. In adult zebrafish, cardiac function can now be studied in great detail due both to the size of the hearts as well as recent technological improvements. Because of their small size, zebrafish are particularly amenable to high frequency echocardiography for detailed functional recordings. Although relatively small, the hearts are easily excised and contractile parameters can be measured from whole hearts, heart slices, individual cardiomyocytes and even single myofibrils.

We sought to determine if simple cardiac risk scores are associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease including carotid wall volume (CWV), carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), and silent brain infarction (SBI). Methods and results A total of 759 adults with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) underwent risk factor assessment and a non-contrast enhanced MRI of the carotid arteries and brain using a standardized protocol in a population-based cohort recruited between 201 and 2018. The non-lab-based INTERHEART risk score (IHRS) was calculated in all participants; the Framingham Risk Score was calculated in a subset who provided blood samples (n = 3889). The association between these risk scores and MRI measures of CWV, carotid IPH, and SBI was determined. The mean age of the cohort was 5 (8.9) years, 55% were women. Each 5-point increase (∼1 SD) in the IHRS was associated with a  mm3 increase in CWV, adjusted for sex (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), a 23% increase in IPH [95% confidence interval (CI) 9–38%], and a 32% (95% CI 20–45%) increase in SBI. These associations were consistent for lacunar and non-lacunar brain infarction. The Framingham Risk Score was also significantly associated with CWV, IPH, and SBI.

However, few studies have comparatively investigated PM2.5-associated risks using DECH and two common metrics of daily mean and hourly peak concentration.We collected daily records of all-cause emergency department visits (EDVs) and hourly data on air pollutants and meteorological factors from Shenzhen, China, 2015-2018. According to guidelines proposed by the World Health Organization, DECH was calculated by summing up daily concentrations exceeding 2 μg/m3. Based on time-stratified case-crossover design, we adopted conditional logistic regression models to assess short-term attributable risks of EDVs associated with PM2.5 using three exposure metrics.DECH and daily average of PM2.5 strongly elevated risks of EDVs, while less evident associations were observed using hourly peak metric. Estimated excess relative risks at lag  day were 0.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 0.91), 0.69% (95% CI: 0.2 to 1.13) and 0.37% (95% CI: 0.0 to 0.76), respectively, associated with an interquartile range increase in DECH (420.2 μg/m3), 24-h average (24.9 μg/m3) and hourly peak concentration (38 μg/m3). More emergency visits could be attributed to DECH than daily mean PM2.5, with attributable fractions of 2.02% (95% CI: 1.42 to 2.61) and 1.09% (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.49), respectively.This study added evidence for increased risk of EDVs associated with exposure to ambient PM2.5.

A system is subject to two types of shocks which arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Type 1 shocks are minor and cause a random amount of damage to the system. We use a minimal repair to fix type 1 shock. Type 2 shocks are catastrophic and the system is correctively replaced at its occurrence. The probabilities of type 1 shock and type 2 shock are assumed to depend on age. A system fails (in a catastrophic failure type) once the cumulative damage reaches a failure level K or a type 2 shock happens. In addition, the system with cumulative damage of level z may fail (in a minor failure type) with probability ω z at each type 1 shock occurrence and be rectified by a minimal repair. A replacement policy based on nature of failure, cumulative damage, system age and number of type 1 shocks is formulated. Under this policy, preventive replacement is made before catastrophic failure when the age of the system reaches T or the number of occurrences of type 1 shock achieves N or the accumulative damage exceeds a level Z but less than K, whichever occurs first, and corrective replacement is immediately carried out whenever the catastrophic failure of the system happens. We determine the optimum preventive replacement schedule such that the expected cost per unit time is minimized.

To determine the potential risks posed to these keystone species, juvenile sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka; 1+ parr) were acutely (24-96 h) or subchronically (21-42 d) exposed to  concentrations of the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of unweathered Cold Lake Blend dilbit (initial total PAC concentrations: 0, 13.7, 34.7 and 124.5 μg/L) in a flow-through system. Dilbit effects on iono-osmoregulation, the physiological stress response, and the immune system were assessed by both biochemical and functional assays. Hydrocarbon bioavailability was evidenced by a significant induction of liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in exposed fish. Acute and subchronic exposure significantly reduced gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity and resulted in lower plasma osmolality, Cl-, and Na+ concentrations.

In particular, the divergence-free condition and boundary conditions are handled naturally, and the ill-conditioning caused by high order terms in the PDE is preconditioned analytically. Despite these advantages, the adoption of integral equation methods has been slow due to a number of difficulties in their implementation. This work describes a complete integral equation-based flow solver that builds on recently developed methods for singular quadrature and the solution of PDEs on complex domains, in combination with several more well-established numerical methods. We apply this solver to flow problems on a number of geometries, both simple and challenging, studying its convergence properties and computational performance. This serves as a demonstration that it is now relatively straightforward to develop a robust, efficient, and flexible Navier-Stokes solver, using integral equation methods.",2020-05-15,Journal of Computational Physics,https://openalex.org/V148709879,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109353,,,,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007937599,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109353,journal-article,3007937599

One possible explanation for this generalization is that real-life behaviors often challenge our balance. We propose that the exacerbated body motions associated with balance-challenged whole body movements increase the value to the nervous system of using a comprehensive internal model to control the task. Because it is less customized to a specific task, a more comprehensive model is also a more generalizable model. Here we tested the hypothesis that challenging balance during adaptation would increase generalization of a newly learned internal model. We encouraged participants to learn a new internal model using prism lenses that created a new visuomotor mapping. Four groups of participants adapted to prisms while performing either a standing-based reaching or precision walking task, with or without a manipulation that challenged balance. To assess generalization after the adaptation phase, participants performed a single trial of each of the other groups’ tasks without prisms. We found that both the reaching and walking balance-challenged groups showed significantly greater generalization to the equivalent, nonadapted task than the balance-unchallenged groups. Additionally, we found some evidence that all groups generalized across tasks, for example, from walking to reaching and vice versa, regardless of balance manipulation. Overall, our results demonstrate that challenging balance increases the degree to which a newly learned internal model generalizes to untrained movements. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Real-life experience indicates that people can generalize between motor behaviors. Here we show that challenging balance during the learning of a new internal model increases the degree of generalization to untrained movements for both reaching and walking tasks. These results suggest that the effects of challenging balance are not specific to the task but instead apply to motor learning more broadly.",2020-03-04,Journal of Neurophysiology,https://openalex.org/V142952003,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00687.2019,,,,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009913505,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00687.2019,journal-article,3009913505

However, the relationship between SIF use and experiencing violence has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. We sought to longitudinally examine the gender-specific relationship between SIF use and exposure to violence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in a Canadian setting. Methods Data were drawn from two prospective cohort studies of PWID in Vancouver, Canada, between December 200 and December 2016. Semi-annually, participants completed questionnaires that elicited data concerning sociodemographic characteristics, behavioural patterns, violent encounters and health service utilization. We used multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the independent association between exclusively injecting drugs at a SIF and experiencing physical or sexual violence among men and women PWID, respectively. Results Of 193 PWID followed for a median of four years, 67 (35.2%) were women and the median age was 4 years at baseline. In total, 35 (52.0%) women and 69 (55.5%) men reported experiencing at least one incident of violence during follow-up. In multivariable analyses, exclusive SIF use was associated with decreased odds of experiencing violence among men after adjusting for potential confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46–0.89). Exclusive SIF use was not significantly associated with experiencing violence among women in adjusted analyses (AOR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.57–1.66). Conclusion In light of the recent expansion of SIFs in Canada, our finding of a protective association between exclusive SIF use and exposure to violence among men is encouraging. The fact that we did not observe a significant association between SIF use and experiencing violence among women highlights the need for social-structural interventions that are more responsive to the specific needs of women PWID in relation to violence prevention.",2020-03-19,International Journal of Drug Policy,https://openalex.org/V60503757,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102692,102692,102692,78,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011229047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102692,journal-article,3011229047

However, the downstream processing of polarized reflections from objects is not well understood. The small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, has been demonstrated to exploit foliar polarized reflections, specifically the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), to recognize host plants. The well-described visual system of P. rapae includes several photoreceptor types (red, green, blue) that are sensitive to polarized light. Yet, the roles and interaction among photoreceptors underlying the behavioral responses of P. rapae to stimuli with different DoLPs remain unknown. To investigate potential neurological mechanisms, we designed several two-choice behavioral bioassays, displaying plant images on paired LCD monitors which allowed for independent control of polarization, color and intensity. When we presented choices between stimuli that differed in either color or DoLP, both decreasing and increasing the intensity of the more attractive stimulus reduced the strength of preference. This result suggests differences in color and DoLP are perceived in a similar manner. When we offered a DoLP choice between plant images manipulated to minimize the response of blue, red, or blue and red photoreceptors, P. rapae shifted its preference for DoLP, suggesting a role for all of these photoreceptors. Modeling of P. rapae photoreceptor responses to test stimuli suggests that differential DoLP is not perceived solely as a color difference.

To overcome this problem, we propose a depth-aware motion blur model that treats a blurred image as an integration of a sequence of clear images. To restore the clear latent image, we extend the Richardson-Lucy method to incorporate our blur model with a given depth image. The empty holes in the depth image, caused by occlusion or device limitations, are fixed by PatchMatch-based depth filling. We regard the depth image as a Markov random field and select candidate labels by using belief propagation to set and smooth depth values for empty areas. Deblurring and depth filling are performed iteratively to refine the results. Our method can also be applied to real-world images with the assistance of motion estimation. The deblurring process is shown to be convergent; moreover, the number of iterations and the level of noise amplification are acceptable.

To examine the properties of arbitrage, we propose a wavelet-based regression approach that is robust to estimation errors, measurement bias and persistence. Relying on this wavelet-based (denoising) inference, we consider various liquidity and market risk indicators to predict arbitrage in a unique ultra-high-frequency exchange rate data set. We find strong empirical evidence that limit order book, realized volatility and cross-correlations help forecast triangular arbitrage profits. The estimates are statistically significant and relevant for investors such that on average 80−100 arbitrage opportunities exist with a short duration (100−500 ms) on a daily basis. Our analysis also reveals that triangular arbitrage opportunities are counter-cyclical at ultra-high-frequency levels: arbitrage returns tend to increase (decrease) in periods when volatility risk and correlations are relatively low (high). We show that liquidity-driven microstructure measures, however, appear to be more powerful in exploiting arbitrage profits when compared to market-driven factors.",2020-02-01,Economic Modelling,https://openalex.org/V141184754,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2019.05.006,57,73,85,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2945281878,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2019.05.006,journal-article,2945281878

In particular, long-term coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant variants of a single pathogen is something of a mystery, given that simple models of pathogens competing for the same ecological niche predict competitive exclusion, and more complex models admitting coexistence require assumptions that may not be justified. Coinfection is among the candidate mechanisms to generate coexistence, as it occurs in many pathogens and provides the opportunity for strains to interact directly. Recently, coinfection and competitive release have been described as creating a form of negative frequency-dependent selection that promotes coexistence, and a range of models containing coinfection have been proposed as having generic stable coexistence of multiple strains. This abundance of new models presents the challenge of comparison and interpretation. To this end, we describe a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the amount of coexistence generated by different models.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: 62 residents and 8 dining rooms. Setting: 3 residential care homes across Canada. Measurements: Eating challenges were measured using the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia Questionnaire (Ed-FED-q). Energy intake was estimated over nine meals. Physical, social, person-centered, functional, and homelike aspects of the mealtime environment were scored using standardized, valid measures. Effects of interactions between dining environment scores and eating challenges on daily energy intake were assessed using linear regression. Results: More eating challenges were associated with decreased energy intake on the general ( β = −36.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −47.8, −25.2) and dementia care units ( β = −19.9, 95% CI = −34.6, −5.2).

Conclusions: Resident eating challenges were significantly associated with energy intake on both dementia care and general care units; however on general care units, when adjusting for eating challenges, the functional and physical aspects of the environment also had a direct effect on energy intake.

Dilbit exposure is known to cause adverse effects in fish, but linking molecular and cellular changes with ecologically-relevant individual performance metrics is needed to better understand the potential consequences of a dilbit spill into the aquatic environment. Therefore, this study examined the effects of dilbit exposure on subcellular responses in cardiac and skeletal muscle in relation to swimming performance in a migratory fish species at risk of exposure, Atlantic salmon. Smolts were exposed subchronically to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of dilbit (WSFd) for 24 d, and then a subset of exposed fish underwent a depuration period of 7 or 14 d, for a total of  experimental time points. At each time point, repeat swimming performance was assessed using sequential critical swimming speed tests (Ucrit) separated by a 24 h rest period, and then several tissues were collected to determine biotransformation enzyme activation, energetic responses, and gene expression changes. Ucrit was unaffected in fish exposed to 67.9 μg/L total initial polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), but fish showed a decreased reliance on lipid metabolism for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the heart that was maintained through 7 d depuration. In contrast, Ucrit increased in fish exposed to 9.65 μg/L PAC, corresponding to an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolic pathways in cardiac and red skeletal muscle, with partial recovery after 7 d depuration. As expected, at both concentrations WSFd hepatic cyp 1A-mediated biotransformation reactions increased, as measured by EROD activity, which remained elevated for 7 d but not after 14 d depuration. Transcript abundance of cyp1a was also increased in muscle tissue and recovered by 14 d depuration. The expression of other stress-related genes increased in white muscle of dilbit-exposed fish, but were largely unchanged in cardiac and red muscle. The transcriptional profile of cardiac tissue was compared to that of sockeye salmon similarly exposed to WSFd in a previous experiment, and is provided in supplemental text. Combined, these results demonstrate that dilbit exposure alters gene expression and enzyme activities related to xenobiotic exposure, cellular stress, and muscle energetics in juvenile Atlantic salmon without impairing swimming performance, and that most of these changes are recoverable within 1 d depuration.",2020-04-01,Aquatic Toxicology,https://openalex.org/V183233548,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105423,105423,105423,221,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001856578,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105423,journal-article,3001856578

It is characterized by an abrupt reduction in median grain size, from gravel- to sand-size sediment, and by a shift in sand transport mode from wash load–dominated to suspended bed material load. We documented changes in channel stability, suspended sediment concentration, flux, and grain size across the GST of the Karnali River, Nepal. Upstream of the GST, gravel-bed channels are stable over hundred- to thousand-year time scales. Downstream, floodplain sediment is reworked by lateral bank erosion, particularly during monsoon discharges. Suspended sediment concentration, grain size, and flux reveal counterintuitive increases downstream of the GST. The results demonstrate a dramatic change in channel dynamics across the GST, from relatively fixed, steep gravel-bed rivers with infrequent avulsion to lower-gradient, relatively mobile sand-bed channels. The increase in sediment concentration and near-bed suspended grain size may be caused by enhanced channel mobility, which facilitates exchange between bed and bank material. These results bring new constraints on channel stability at mountain fronts and indicate that temporally and spatially limited sediment flux measurements downstream of GSTs are more indicative of flow stage and floodplain recycling than of continental-scale sediment flux and denudation rate estimates.",2020-05-01,Geology,https://openalex.org/V56162041,Geological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46909.1,468,472,48,5,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006214421,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46909.1,journal-article,3006214421

We also find that the reductions are greater for firms facing greater financing constraints and agency issues, and for those for which the informational shocks are stronger. Further analyses reveal a reduction in firms’ average cash savings rate, an increase in performance, an increase in the use of external debt, a decrease in abnormal investment, and an increase in the value of cash holdings.

The task was to discriminate a target that appeared with equal probability at the previous location of the face, house, or the control image. In all experiments, our data indicated no spontaneous biasing of attention for targets occurring at the previous location of the face. Experiment 3, which measured oculomotor biasing, suggested a reliable but infrequent saccadic bias towards the eye region of upright faces. Importantly, these results did not reflect our specific laboratory settings, as in Experiment 4, we present a full replication of a classic finding in the literature demonstrating reliable social attention bias. Together, these data suggest that attentional biasing for social information is task and context mediated, and less robust than originally thought.",2020-07-01,Psychological Research-psychologische Forschung,https://openalex.org/V35819839,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1130-4,1407,1423,84,5,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2907245979,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1130-4,journal-article,2907245979

Global health agendas, however, continue to deprioritise older women’s health issues, including the incidence of and mortality from non-communicable disease (NCDs). This is the first systematic review to address the health, wellbeing and healthcare utilization of older SSA women. Methods Studies with primary analysis of health, wellbeing and/or healthcare utilization outcomes for women over the age of 5 from SSA countries were included. Databases searched include EMBASE, Scopus and Psycinfo. Findings About 2 studies from six SSA countries met inclusion criteria. Studies regarding NCDs predominated (n = 12), followed by healthcare utilization (n = 4), disability (n = 4), wellbeing (n = 2), depression (n = 2) and HIV (n = 2). Every study indicated significantly lower self-rated health and wellbeing, higher rates of depression, hypertension, obesity, disability or weakness for women compared with men. The studies also indicated that older women use healthcare more often, and choose public over private facilities more often. Interpretation The studies in the review had large, diverse samples.

In Canada, increased extraction of bitumen from the oil sands and transport of the major crude oil export product, diluted bitumen (dilbit), amplifies the risk of a spill and contamination of Canadian waterways. Fish exposed to sublethal concentrations of crude oil can experience a variety of adverse physiological effects including osmoregulatory dysfunction. As regulation of water and ion balance is crucial during the seawater transition of anadromous fish, the hypothesis that dilbit impairs seawater acclimation in Atlantic salmon smolts (a fish at risk of exposure in Canada) was tested. Smolts were exposed for 2 d to the water-soluble fraction of dilbit in freshwater, and then transferred directly to seawater or allowed a 1 wk depuration period in uncontaminated freshwater prior to seawater transfer. The seawater acclimation response was quantified at 1 and 7 d post-transfer using established hematological, tissue, and molecular endpoints including gill Na+/K+-ATPase gene expression (nka). All smolts, irrespective of dilbit exposure, increased serum Na+ concentrations and osmolality within 1 d of seawater transfer. The recovery of these parameters to freshwater values by 7 d post-transfer was likely driven by the increased expression and activity of Na+/K+-ATPase in the gill. Histopathological changes in the gill were not observed; however, CYP1A-like immunoreactivity was detected in the pillar cells of gill lamellae of fish exposed to 67.9 μg/L PAC. Concentration-specific changes in kidney expression of a transmembrane water channel, aquaporin 3, occurred during seawater acclimation, but were resolved with 1 wk of depuration and were not associated with histopathological changes. In conclusion, apart from a robust CYP response in the gill, dilbit exposure did not greatly impact common measures of seawater acclimation, suggesting that significant osmoregulatory dysfunction is unlikely to occur if Atlantic salmon smolts are exposed sub-chronically to dilbit.",2020-04-01,Aquatic Toxicology,https://openalex.org/V183233548,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105419,105419,105419,221,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002322570,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105419,journal-article,3002322570

One explanation for this trait—and the one tested here—is that synesthesia results from unusually weak pruning of cortical synaptic hyperconnectivity during early perceptual development. We tested the prediction from this hypothesis that synesthetes would be superior at making discriminations from nonnative categories that are normally weakened by experience-dependent pruning during a critical period early in development—namely, discrimination among nonnative phonemes (Hindi retroflex /d̪a/ and dental /ɖa/), among chimpanzee faces, and among inverted human faces. Like the superiority of 6-mo-old infants over older infants, the synesthetic groups were significantly better than control groups at making all the nonnative discriminations across five samples and three testing sites. The consistent superiority of the synesthetic groups in making discriminations that are normally eliminated during infancy suggests that residual cortical connectivity in synesthesia supports changes in perception that extend beyond the specific synesthetic percepts, consistent with the incomplete pruning hypothesis.",2020-05-05,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1914668117,10089,10096,117,18,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3019110705,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1914668117,journal-article,3019110705

Defects are also introduced to break the lattice symmetry of graphene and thereby obtain enhanced optoelectronic and other properties. It is important that gains in certain properties due to the presence defects are not at the expense of mechanical strength which is important in handling graphene and device fabrication. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the tensile strength and fracture strain of monolayer graphene with commonly observed topological defects and nanopores. Both molecular dynamics and the atomic-scale finite element method (AFEM) are used in this study, and the accuracy of AFEM in simulating complex topological and vacancy defects including line defects is established. It is found that the tensile strength properties have a complex dependency on the defect shape, size, and chirality.

One of the most important karstic areas in Europe that contains a rich archaeological record during this cultural period is the Cantabrian Region, northern Spain. We explore the archaeological evidence recovered from the lower levels of the stratigraphic sequence in El Miron Cave dated between 27 and 48ka cal BP – Gravettian and Mousterian in age. Zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of the limited number of mammal bones, together with the small lithic artefact assemblages, suggest brief human occupations after which the carcass remains left by humans and, composed mainly of Spanish ibex, red deer and some leporids, were scavenged by carnivores. Carnivores were probably also agents of accumulation, especially in the two lowest layers in which artifacts are most scarce. Notable palaeontological finds include remains of mammoth and leopard. Stable isotopic analyses of Spanish ibex remains provide information of relatively open landscape and suggest that cooler conditions prevailed during the Early Upper Palaeolithic.

To solve the problem, previous schemes mainly explore the structures of social graphs to reduce the inter-server traffic. Based on the observation of high cluster coefficients in OSNs, a state-of-the-art social piggyback scheme can save redundant messages by exploiting an intrinsic hub-structure in an OSN graph for message piggybacking. Essentially, finding the best hub-structure for piggybacking is equivalent to finding a variation of the densest sub-graph. The existing scheme computes the best hub-structure by iteratively removing the node with the minimum weighted degree. Such a scheme incurs a worst computation cost of $O(n^2)$ O ( n  ) , making it not scalable to large-scale OSN graphs. Using alternative hub-structure instead of the best hub-structure can speed up the piggyback assignment. However, they greatly sacrifice the communication efficiency of the assignment schedule. Different from the existing designs, in this work, we propose a QuickPoint algorithm, which removes a fraction of nodes in each iteration in finding the best hub-structure.

Recent studies document the presence of a planting pit here where, with interception of the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater lens and use of organic mulch, aroids could be grown. Original pit excavation is dated to first landfall or shortly thereafter. Dates further indicate the pit was filled between 269 and 239 cal BP. The saturated mulch, combined with coralline sand in the pit-bottom, resulted in a gray-brown silty-sand planting matrix. Microfossil analysis of these sediments have identified Oceanic cultigens, including giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma merkusii), taro (Colocasia esculenta), banana (Musa sp.), candle nut (Aleurites moluccana), pandanus (Pandanus tectorius), and coconut (Cocos nucifera). Also present in the matrix are large numbers of Lapita ceramic sherds, these probably added for moisture retention and, possibly, nutrients as they degrade. The planting pit is the earliest recorded evidence for this type of cultivation in Oceania.

Few kidney cancer survivors (KCS) are meeting single-activity or combined guidelines; therefore, examining factors influencing PA participation is warranted. The purpose of this study is to examine demographic, medical, social-cognitive, and environmental correlates of meeting independent (i.e., aerobic-only, strength training (ST)-only) and combined guidelines (i.e., aerobic and ST) in KCS. KCS (N = 651) completed self-reported measures of PA and demographic, medical, social-cognitive, and perceived environmental factors. Built environment was assessed using the geographic information systems (GIS). Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to determine the correlates of meeting the combined versus independent guidelines. Compared with meeting neither guideline, meeting aerobic-only guidelines was associated with higher intentions (p < .01) and planning (p < .01); meeting ST-only guidelines was associated with higher intentions (p = .02) and planning (p < .01), lower perceived behavioral control (PBC) (p = .03), healthy weight (p = .01), and older age (p < .01); and meeting the combined guidelines were associated with higher intentions (p < .01), planning (p = .02), higher instrumental attitudes (p < .01), higher education (p = .04), better health (p < .01), and localized cancer (p = .05).

Common ways of quantifying coactivation using electromyographic signals do not consider frequency information in the signal. As electromyographic signals from different motor unit types have different frequency components and muscle fiber type can change in individuals with spinal cord injury, it may be beneficial to consider frequency components. The aims were to demonstrate the utility of using a method which considers temporal and frequency components of the electromyographical signal to quantify coactivation in lower extremity muscles in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury through 1) comparison with able-bodied individuals and 2) comparison before and after body weight supported treadmill training. Methods Frequency decomposition techniques were applied to electromyographical signals to consider the temporal and frequency components of the electromyographical signals to quantify coactivation over a range of frequencies. Results Our main findings show that correlation coefficients between total EMG intensities of rectus femoris-biceps femoris and medial gastrocnemius-tibialis anterior were significantly different between able-bodied individuals and those with incomplete spinal cord injury (p = 0006, p = 0.01). The correlation spectra of medial gastrocnemius-tibialis anterior of the spinal cord injury group were substantially different than those the able-bodied group, while the EMG normalcy score was significantly different (p = 0.002). We also found that there was a change in coactivation of ankle muscles after body weight supported treadmill training. Interpretation Our findings indicate that there may be frequency specific differences in muscle coactivation between able-bodied individuals and those with incomplete spinal cord injury. Changes in coactivation were also observed before and after body weight supported treadmill training. These differences may reflect the changes in recruitment patterns of different motor unit types.",2020-03-01,Clinical Biomechanics,https://openalex.org/V74384676,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2020.01.001,101,107,73,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998759318,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2020.01.001,journal-article,2998759318

This paper analyses the expansion of the China National Tobacco Company (CNTC) in Zimbabwe, the largest producer of tobacco leaf globally, since the early 2000s, through document analysis. It applies a political economy framework—identifying material, ideational and institutional forces—to demonstrate how CNTC capitalized on the unique features of China-Africa development cooperation to pursue its expansion goals, which threaten global public health efforts to reduce tobacco supply. In a context of economic crisis, CNTC offered substantial resources to revive Zimbabwe’s tobacco industry, promoting a shift to contract farming of its preferred leaf. It benefited from perceptions of state friendship, which it fostered through corporate social responsibility initiatives. Through ties with the Chinese embassy and economic actors, CNTC embedded its interests in development institutions. While contributing to improved foreign exchange earnings and some farmers’ livelihoods, CNTC’s expansion has increased the dependence on China as a development partner and tobacco as a crop, benefitting its “go global” strategy, while contributing to public health and environmental challenges locally and globally.

Mutualistic networks, such as those of plants and pollinators tend to have a core set of properties that often relate to the resilience of the community, or the ability of the community to retain function and structure after a disturbance. Furthermore, network structure is highly dependent on the number of specialists and generalists; however, it is unclear how different groups of species with various life-history strategies influence network structure. In this study, we evaluated how the composition of plants and pollinators within 16 oak-savanna sites changed across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we evaluated how the abundance of different groups of plants and pollinators affected network metrics related to resilience. We found that the composition of plants and pollinators varied between ecoregions, while pollinator composition further varied with habitat characteristics. Network metrics displayed no spatial pattern but were related to the abundance of several pollinator groups. Above-ground nesting insects had a positive relationship with nestedness and a negative relationship with modularity, while predatory larvae had a negative relationship with modularity. Thus, above-ground nesting insects and predatory larvae could be expected to increase network resilience.

Wang's multivariate Hensel lifting recovers the variables one at a time. It is currently implemented in many computer algebra systems, including Maple, Magma and Singular. When the factors are sparse, Wang's approach can be exponential in the number of variables n . To address this, sparse Hensel lifting was introduced by Zippel and then improved by Kaltofen. Recently, Monagan and Tuncer introduced a new approach which uses sparse polynomial interpolation to solve the multivariate polynomial diophantine equations that arise inside Hensel lifting in random polynomial time. This approach is shown to be practical and faster than Zippel's and Kaltofen's algorithms and faster than Wang's algorithm for non-zero evaluation points. In this work we first present a complete description of the sparse interpolation used by Monagan and Tuncer and show that it runs in random polynomial time. Next we study what happens to the sparsity of multivariate polynomials when the variables are successively evaluated at numbers. We determine the expected number of remaining terms. We use this result to revisit and correct the complexity analysis of Zippel's original sparse interpolation. Next we present an average case complexity analysis of our approach. We have implemented our algorithm in Maple with some sub-algorithms implemented in C. We present some experimental data comparing our approach with Wang's method for both sparse and dense factors.

Their large storage capacity makes clathrates attractive media for a variety of gas storage and separation applications, but there is relatively little information on the chemical stability and diffusion of guest molecules. At the fundamental level inter-cage transition energies have been calculated, but the results need to be tested with experimental data. Ideally this should involve single-atom transport, using an isotopic tracer or spin label. Muonium (Mu = μ+e–) qualifies on both counts. As a single-electron atom with the muon as nucleus it may be considered a light isotope of hydrogen. Furthermore muonium and its reaction products may be monitored by muon spin spectroscopy. In recent years we have used this method to probe H-atom and free radical behaviour in clathrate hydrates. The current work extends studies to benzene and acetone clathrate hydrates. Of note is the simultaneous detection of muonium and muoniated radicals in the same sample. This can happen when Mu is trapped in an empty cavity, remote from its reaction partner. Increase in temperature leads to transport of Mu between cages and results in encounters with reactive guest molecules. By studying the temperature dependence of Mu and radical signals, we have been able to determine the activation energy for transport of Mu between cavities.",2020-03-01,Radiation Physics and Chemistry,https://openalex.org/V147871266,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108532,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972250742,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108532,journal-article,2972250742

These expectations are injunctive norms, shared beliefs about appropriate behavior for identity group members, and individuals' choices reflect trade‐offs between adherence to these norms and other preferences. We show that when those who identify moderately/strongly with the group pay a cost as a consequence of avoiding a norm violation, they subsequently view the norms as stronger than those that paid no cost. This is evident in their greater willingness to pay an additional cost to punish/reward other group members for violating/complying with the norm. They also view other norms associated with the identity as stronger. In this way, costly norm compliance may be self‐reinforcing.",2020-01-01,Southern Economic Journal,https://openalex.org/V16296580,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12410,1222,1240,86,3,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983210953,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12410,journal-article,2983210953

The combination of minimal invasive cell imaging with high resolution positions SMLM at the forefront of scientific discovery in cancer, infectious, and degenerative diseases. By stochastic temporal and spatial separation of light emissions from fluorescent labelled proteins, SMLM is capable of nanometer scale reconstruction of cellular structures. Precise localization of proteins in 3D astigmatic SMLM is dependent on parameter sensitive preprocessing steps to select regions of interest. With SMLM acquisition highly variable over time, it is non-trivial to find an optimal static parameter configuration. The high emitter density required for reconstruction of complex protein structures can compromise accuracy and introduce artifacts. To address these problems, we introduce two modular auto-tuning pre-processing methods: adaptive signal detection and learned recurrent signal density estimation that can leverage the information stored in the sequence of frames that compose the SMLM acquisition process. We show empirically that our contributions improve accuracy, precision and recall with respect to the state of the art. Both modules auto-tune their hyper-parameters to reduce the parameter space for practitioners, improve robustness and reproducibility, and are validated on a reference in silico dataset. Adaptive signal detection and density prediction can offer a practitioner, in addition to informed localization, a tool to tune acquisition parameters ensuring improved reconstruction of the underlying protein complex. We illustrate the challenges faced by practitioners in applying SMLM algorithms on real world data markedly different from the data used in development and show how ERGO can be run on new datasets without retraining while motivating the need for robust transfer learning in SMLM.",2020-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,https://openalex.org/V58069681,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2019.2962361,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997203508,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2019.2962361,journal-article,2997203508

In this paper, we propose an improved hybrid layered image compression framework by combining deep learning and the traditional image codecs. At the encoder, we first use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain a compact representation of the input image, which is losslessly encoded by the FLIF codec as the base layer of the bit stream. A coarse reconstruction of the input is obtained by another CNN from the reconstructed compact representation. The residual between the input and the coarse reconstruction is then obtained and encoded by the H.265/HEVC-based BPG codec as the enhancement layer of the bit stream. Experimental results using the Kodak and Tecnick datasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based layered coding scheme and traditional codecs including BPG in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics across a wide range of bit rates, when the images are coded in the RGB444 domain.",2020-03-01,Signal Processing-image Communication,https://openalex.org/V38090728,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2019.115774,115774,115774,82,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997722241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2019.115774,journal-article,2997722241

The RS of single crystalline HfO2 films has been rarely reported. Yttrium doped HfO2 (YDH) thin films were fabricated and successful Y incorporation into HfO2 was confirmed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. A pure cubic phase of YDH and an abrupt YDH/Si interface were obtained and verified by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A Pt/YDH/n++-Si heterostructure using Si as the bottom electrode was fabricated, which shows stable RS with an ON/OFF ratio of 100 and a reliable data retention (104 s). The electron transport mechanism was investigated in detail. It indicates that hopping conduction is dominating when the device is at a high resistance state, while space charge limited conduction acts as the dominant factor at a low resistance state. Such behavior, which is different from devices using TiN or Ti as electrodes, was attributed to the Y doping and specific YDH/Si interface.

In maternal health, their role includes the provision of preventive and promotional health services at the community level. They provide services such as health education on maternal health wellbeing, advice and information on access and timely utilization of health facilities for prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. The contribution of M-CHWs in the health sector combined with other government initiatives led the country to achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) - target 5A- that aimed to improve maternal health through the reduction of maternal mortality ratio by 75% between 1990 and 2015). The objective of this study was to explore M-CHWs’ perceptions and experiences on access and provision of maternal health services. Methods We used a case study methodology, a qualitative research approach to explore M-CHWs’ experiences and perceptions on access and provision of maternal health services at the community level in Rwanda . For the period of June–August 2014, in-depth interviews were conducted with sixteen M-CHWs who had been providing maternal health services in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. Participants shared their experiences and perceptions on access and provision of maternal health service in their communities. Results The results of this research highlight the role of M-CHWs in promoting the use of health facilities for prenatal care and delivery and the ways they use to reach out to women. Several challenges prohibit M-CHWs to deliver adequate maternal health services and these are related to the poor resources settings in which they operate. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the experiences and perceptions of M-CHWs on the provision and access to maternal health services in their communities. The fact that M-CHWs are volunteers operating in limited resources settings with no formal training in maternal health and with considerable workloads translates into challenges regarding the quality and quantity of services they provide in their communities. Such challenges create an impact on M-CHWs service provision, satisfaction and retention. The voices of M-CHWs and the communities they serve are needed to explore areas that are specific to each community context that would contribute to making the M-CHW program sustainable to achieve equitable access to maternal health services.",2020-06-09,BMC Health Services Research,https://openalex.org/V12898181,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05405-0,,,20,1,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033880340,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05405-0,journal-article,3033880340

Following the recent literature, the identification of the structural parameters is characterized by the Jacobian of the moment conditions. We unify several definitions of identification that have been used in the literature, and show how they are linked to the consistency and asymptotic normality of GMM estimators. We then develop two tests to assess the identification strength of the structural parameters in models that are (i) either linear or separable; (ii) neither linear nor separable. Both tests are straightforward to apply and allow to test specific subvectors without assuming identification of the components not under test. In simulations, our tests are well-behaved when compared to contenders, both in terms of size and power. In addition, we show how pretesting specific subvectors can improve inference by delivering shorter confidence regions with comparable coverage probability.

This paper aims to incorporate hierarchical credibility theory, which is used in property and casualty insurance, to model multi-country mortality rates.

Numerical illustrations based on mortality data from the Human Mortality Database for both genders of the US, the UK and Japan with a series of fitting year spans and three forecasting periods show that the hierarchical credibility approach contributes to more accurate forecasts measured by the AMAPE (average of mean absolute percentage errors).

Inpatient falls are the most commonly reported safety incident in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), costing the NHS £630 million a year. Injurious falls are particularly life-limiting and costly. There is a growing body of evidence on shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury prevention; however, no systematic review exists to inform practice. Methods and analysis We will systematically identify, appraise and summarise studies investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness, and experiences of shock-absorbing flooring in hospitals and care homes. Our search will build on an extensive search conducted by a scoping review (inception to May 2016). We will search electronic databases (AgeLine, CINAHL, MEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus and Web of Science; May 2016–present), trial registries and grey literature. We will conduct backward and forward citation searches of included studies, and liaise with study researchers. We will evaluate the influence of floors on fall-related injuries, falls and staff work-related injuries through randomised and non-randomised studies, consider economic and qualitative evidence, and implementation factors. We will consider risk of bias, assess heterogeneity and explore potential effect modifiers via subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate we will combine studies through meta-analysis. We will use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach to evaluate the quality of evidence and present the results using summary of findings tables, and adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. Ethics and dissemination We will follow the ethical principles of systematic review conduct, by attending to publication ethics, transparency and rigour. Our dissemination plan includes peer-reviewed publication, presentations, press release, stakeholder symposium, patient video and targeted knowledge-to-action reports.

In order to select representative images from a large image set to construct an album, we propose a new album management method in a comic-like layout based on images classification. We mainly focus on three key problems: how to organize the input set of images reasonably; how to classify and select representative images rapidly and accurately according to the user intent; how to display the representative images clearly. For the first problem, we use the model organization idea of Quartet Analysis, analyzing the set of images by the multiple global features, and we realize the effective organization of the images through the construction of the categorization tree (C-tree). For the second problem, in order to express the user intent better, we perform fine classification by using active learning method based on the C-tree. Then we recommend representative images for the user to select. For the third problem, we display representative images in a compact comic-like layout with hierarchical ordering information. To enrich layout styles, we create a template library based on enumeration by comic layout rules and complete the template selection and automatic collage of the images based on the principle of presenting the maximum information content of the images to be displayed.

Second, both use Twitter primarily for publicity and to support and associate with individuals and groups. Trudeau is much more likely to use Twitter to portray himself as a non-political figure, while May is more likely to emphasize the role of policy ‘decider.’ Both prime ministers are framed much more often as national legislative leaders rather than party leaders or executives. Finally, May’s tweets reflect her position as an international leader much more than Trudeau’s. Assessing how prime ministers’ tweets reflect these dimensions contributes to our understanding of evolving leader–follower dynamics in the age of social media. While Twitter has been cited as conducive to populist leaders and rhetoric, this study shows how two non-populist leaders have adopted this medium, particularly in Trudeau’s case, to construct a personalized leader–follower relationship.",2020-03-05,Politics and Governance,https://openalex.org/V2764872494,Cogitatio,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v8i1.2530,158,170,8,1,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009933835,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v8i1.2530,journal-article,3009933835

Using a historical institutionalist analysis over three decades (1990–2020) of Wisconsin energy and forest products policy development, changes in the capacity of the mix to encourage the production of forest biopower are examined. The study reveals the state experienced early periods of policy congruency via policy layering as efforts to promote the use of forest waste as biofuel emerged as an important part of the state's overall energy mix. However, more recent calls for cost effective and affordable energy has resulted in “policy dilution” in this sector, a form of policy dismantling largely ignored in the literature on the subject. This story is one like policy ‘stretching’ in which a policy mix develops through patches and layering until such time as its internal contradictions drive processes of more substantive reform. Although the policy change literature tends to focus on cases in which reforms are added to mixes in order to strengthen a stretched regime, as this case study shows, this process can also work in reverse, with additions paradoxically leading to the dismantling of important aspects of an existing policy arrangement.",2020-09-01,Energy research and social science,https://openalex.org/V2764593084,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101514,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3020449390,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101514,journal-article,3020449390

Exploring the case of the socio-politically complex cultures of the Northwest Coast, we argue that while tenure and proprietorship were mediated by historical precedent of use (proprietorship-through-endowment), investments in places through physical engagement with or transformation of coastal landforms could be used to make explicit these endowed rights or to assert or negotiate new rights (proprietorship-through-investment). A key ingredient in negotiating proprietorship was an engagement with the dynamic coast itself, an active agent in landscape transformation perceived as being spiritually powerful. Using the archaeological landscape of the Prince Rupert Harbour area, we assess the timing and tempo of measurable investments in the physical landscape at village sites and the occurrence of independent archaeological proxies for restricted or unequal access to territory or resources. Systems of territorial proprietorship existed there by at least the mid-Holocene, though we document increasingly institutionalized proprietorship systems coincident with increased investments into the built environment beginning ~3000 years ago. Our approach has broad applicability, and encourages archaeologists to explore the role of human engagement with dynamic landscapes in the generation of senses of identity and social or political organization.",2020-09-01,Journal of Anthropological Archaeology,https://openalex.org/V34740387,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2020.101179,101179,101179,59,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3030543365,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2020.101179,journal-article,3030543365

The analysis of these events is a promising tool for understanding evolutionary genomics. Many pairwise rearrangement distances have been proposed, based on finding the minimum number of rearrangement events to transform one genome into the other, using some predefined operation. When more than two genomes are considered, we have the more challenging problem of rearrangement-based phylogeny reconstruction. One important problem is the Closest Genome Problem (CGP), that aims to find, for a given distance notion, a genome that minimizes the maximum distance to any other, which can be seen as finding a genome in the center of all others. The Hamming Closest String Problem (Hamming-CSP) was already studied and settled to be NP-complete.

To answer these questions, we distinguish between long-run secular trends in the period from 192 to 193 related to the formation of trade blocs (in particular, the British Commonwealth) and short-run disruptions associated with the trade wars of the 1930s (in particular, large and widespread declines in bilateral trade, the narrowing of trade imbalances, and sharp drops in average traded distances). We argue that the trade wars mainly served to intensify pre-existing efforts towards the formation of trade blocs which dated from at least 1920.

In this paper, we consider compressed sensing (CS) for parallel acquisition systems when the individual sensors use subgaussian random sampling. Our main results are a series of uniform recovery guarantees which relate the number of measurements required to the basis in which the solution is sparse and certain characteristics of the multi-sensor system, known as sensor profile matrices. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions for optimal recovery, in the sense that the number of measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of sensors, and demonstrate explicit examples of multi-sensor systems for which this holds. We establish these results by proving the so-called Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP) for the sensing system and use this to derive both nonuniversal and universal recovery guarantees. Compared to existing work, our results not only lead to better stability and robustness estimates but also provide simpler and sharper constants in the measurement conditions. Finally, we show how the problem of CS with block-diagonal sensing matrices can be viewed as a particular case of our multi-sensor framework.

A gene family evolves along the branches of a species tree through various mechanisms, including—but not limited to—speciation ( $${\mathbb {S}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math> ), gene duplication ( $${\mathbb {D}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math> ), gene loss ( $${\mathbb {L}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math> ), and horizontal gene transfer ( $${\mathbb {T}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math> ). The reconstruction of a gene tree representing the evolution of a gene family constrained by a species tree is an important problem in phylogenomics. However, unlike in the multispecies coalescent evolutionary model that considers only speciation and incomplete lineage sorting events, very little is known about the search space for gene family histories accounting for gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer (the $${\mathbb {D}}{\mathbb {L}}{\mathbb {T}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math> -model). In this work, we introduce the notion of evolutionary histories defined as a binary ordered rooted tree describing the evolution of a gene family, constrained by a species tree in the $${\mathbb {D}}{\mathbb {L}}{\mathbb {T}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math> -model. We provide formal grammars describing the set of all evolutionary histories that are compatible with a given species tree, whether it is ranked or unranked. These grammars allow us, using either analytic combinatorics or dynamic programming, to efficiently compute the number of histories of a given size, and also to generate random histories of a given size under the uniform distribution. We apply these tools to obtain exact asymptotics for the number of gene family histories for two species trees, the rooted caterpillar and complete binary tree, as well as estimates of the range of the exponential growth factor of the number of histories for random species trees of size up to 25. Our results show that including horizontal gene transfers induce a dramatic increase of the number of evolutionary histories. We also show that, within ranked species trees, the number of evolutionary histories in the $${\mathbb {D}}{\mathbb {L}}{\mathbb {T}}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math> -model is almost independent of the species tree topology.

From the first property, we present a sharp condition for existence (respectively non-existence) of global minimizers in a large class of domains, analogous to results in free space, and from the second property, we identify that external forces are necessary to confine the swarm and grant existence of global minimizers in general domains.

We investigated whether native and non-native predator density on the home reefs of juvenile striped parrotfish, Scarus iseri, which reflects their early exposure to predation risk, influences their behavioural responses and survival when faced with some of these predators under controlled conditions. In aquaria, parrotfish exhibited evasive behaviour, in the form of increased immobility and increased distance from threat, in response to visual and chemical cues from native predatory grouper (Epinephelus striatus) but not from invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois sp.), suggesting no evidence of risk perception in relation to the non-native predator. However, parrotfish from high-risk reefs exhibited more evasive behaviours and colour responses (i.e. more mottled coloration) in response to all stimuli than parrotfish from low-risk reefs. Moreover, more parrotfish from high-risk reefs than from low-risk reefs survived in direct encounters with lionfish, and those parrotfish that survived were those that had displayed increased immobility when exposed to lionfish cues. We suggest that predation, especially by non-native lionfish, targeting risk-taking fish could result in greater overall cautiousness in some prey populations. This heightened risk avoidance ultimately aids prey fish to evade non-native lionfish, even in the absence of predator recognition.",2020-06-01,Animal Behaviour,https://openalex.org/V157690423,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.013,205,216,164,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3028243272,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.013,journal-article,3028243272

For this we use feature selection and train a random forest classifier on extracted melody n-grams and rhythm grams of songs from  different groups of origin, 8 from each. We use its importances to reduce the feature space dimension for the construction of an informative network, which we visualized in a interactive web application.

Previous studies have suggested Indigenous peoples were able to maintain the productivity of Atlantic salmon and lake trout fisheries in the Great Lakes region through the use of resource management strategies. Since males tend to be the surplus sex among salmonids, one way in which Indigenous peoples could have managed Atlantic salmon and lake trout stocks was through the preferential harvesting of males. Here, we sought to investigate whether Indigenous peoples traditionally used sex-selective fishing to manage Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon and lake trout stocks. To address this question, we modified a DNA-based sex identification method developed for ancient Pacific salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) remains to make it applicable to archaeological Atlantic salmonid (Salmo spp.) and char (Salvelinus spp.) remains. This method assigns sex identities to samples through two PCR assays that co-amplify a fragment of the Y-specific salmonid master sex-determining gene (sexually dimorphic on the Y-chromosome gene) and an internal positive control, consisting of a fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop or nuclear clock1b gene. We applied this method to 6 Atlantic salmon and lake trout remains from the Antrex site (AjGv-38), a Middle Ontario Iroquoian (ca. CE 125 to 1300) village located in the Lake Ontario watershed. Using this method, we successfully assigned sex identities to 5 of these remains (83.61% success rate), highlighting our method’s sensitivity and efficacy. Statistical analyses indicate neither the aggregate sex ratio nor the sex ratios obtained for the individual species were male-biased. This suggests Antrex’s Middle Ontario Iroquoian inhabitants probably did not practice male-selective fishing for Atlantic salmon or lake trout.",2020-06-01,Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports,https://openalex.org/V2764743818,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102301,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015629516,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102301,journal-article,3015629516

An experimental investigation in a simple macroeconomic model,Abstract We conduct experiments with human subjects in a model with a positive production externality in which productivity is a nondecreasing function of the average level of employment of other firms. The model has three steady states and a sunspot equilibrium that fluctuates between the high and low steady states. Steady states are payoff ranked: low values give lower profits than higher values. We investigate whether subjects can learn a sunspot equilibrium. We observe coordination on the extrinsic announcements in our experimental economies. Cases of apparent convergence to the low and high steady states are also observed.,2020-01-01,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,https://openalex.org/V44585919,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2019.103775,,,,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980114169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2019.103775,journal-article,2980114169

This paper describes a situation calculus approach to expressing and proving properties of non-terminating programs expressed in Golog, a high level logic programming language for modeling and implementing dynamical systems. Because in this approach actions and programs are represented in classical (second-order) logic, it is natural to express and prove properties of Golog programs, including non-terminating ones, in the very same logic. This approach to program proofs has the advantage of logical uniformity and the availability of classical proof theory.",2020-06-01,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,https://openalex.org/V90199469,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10472-019-09643-9,,,,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984636524,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10472-019-09643-9,journal-article,2984636524
