Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.",2020-02-12,Canadian Journal Of Anesthesia/journal Canadien D'anesthésie,https://openalex.org/V4210186964,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x,568,576,67,5,1,578,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005561939,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x,journal-article,3005561939

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual.

However, these conventional iron- and copper-based transformers increase the weight/size and cost of the inverter while reducing the efficiency and power density. It is therefore desirable to avoid using transformers in the inverter. However, additional care must be taken to avoid safety hazards such as ground fault currents and leakage currents, e.g., via the parasitic capacitor between the PV panel and ground. Consequently, the grid connected transformerless PV inverters must comply with strict safety standards such as IEEE 1547.1, VDE0126-1-1, EN 50106, IEC61727, and $\text{A}S/N$ ZS 5033. Various transformerless inverters have been proposed recently to eliminate the leakage current using different techniques such as decoupling the dc from the ac side and/or clamping the common mode (CM) voltage (CMV) during the freewheeling period, or using common ground configurations. The permutations and combinations of various decoupling techniques with integrated voltage buck–boost for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) allow numerous new topologies and configurations which are often confusing and difficult to follow when seeking to select the right topology. Therefore, to present a clear picture on the development of transformerless inverters for the next-generation grid-connected PV systems, this paper aims to comprehensively review and classify various transformerless inverters with detailed analytical comparisons. To reinforce the findings and comparisons as well as to give more insight on the CM characteristics and leakage current, computer simulations of major transformerless inverter topologies have been performed in PLECS software. Moreover, the cost and size are analyzed properly and summarized in a table.

As the predominant psychopathology even in treated BD, depression is associated not only with excess morbidity, but also mortality from co-occurring general-medical disorders and high suicide risk. In BD, risks for medical disorders including diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disorders, and associated mortality rates are several-times above those for the general population or with other psychiatric disorders. The SMR for suicide with BD reaches 20-times above general-population rates, and exceeds rates with other major psychiatric disorders. In BD, suicide is strongly associated with mixed (agitated-dysphoric) and depressive phases, time depressed, and hospitalization. Lithium may reduce suicide risk in BD; clozapine and ketamine require further testing. Treatment of bipolar depression is far less well investigated than unipolar depression, particularly for long-term prophylaxis. Short-term efficacy of antidepressants for bipolar depression remains controversial and they risk clinical worsening, especially in mixed states and with rapid-cycling. Evidence of efficacy of lithium and anticonvulsants for bipolar depression is very limited; lamotrigine has long-term benefit, but valproate and carbamazepine are inadequately tested and carry high teratogenic risks.

Data after 2-yr follow-up are now available for analysis. Objective To determine if there was a difference in the AS failure rate in a 2-yr follow-up period among men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initial confirmatory biopsy (CBx) compared to those who did not. Design, setting, and participants This is the 2-yr post-CBx follow-up for the ASIST trial, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study for men with Gleason grade group (GG)  cancer eligible for AS. Patients were randomized to CBx with 12-core systematic sampling or MRI with systematic and targeted sampling. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Patients with GG ≤ 1 on CBx were followed for 2 yr and had MRI and biopsy at that time point. Patients failed AS if they were no longer under AS because of grade progression, clinical progression, subject choice, clinical judgment, treatment, or lost to follow-up. Clinically significant cancer (CSC) was defined as GG ≥ 2. Results and limitations In total, 25 men underwent CBx, 13 in the non-MRI and 12 in the MRI arm. After biopsy, 10 men in the non-MRI arm (76%) and 9 in the MRI arm (77%) continued AS. There were fewer men with AS failures in the MRI (19/98, 19%) compared to the non-MRI group (35/101, 35%; p =  0.017). At 2-yr biopsy there were fewer men with CSC in the MRI arm (9.9%, 8/81) than in the non-MRI arm (23%, 17/75; p =  0.048). Significant differences in AS failure rates were detected across the three centers in the MRI arm only (4.2% [2/48] vs 17% [4/24] vs 27% [7/26]; p =  0.019). Conclusions Baseline MRI before CBx during AS results in 50% fewer AS failures and less grade progression over 2 yr. The center where MRI and targeted biopsy is performed may influence AS failure rates. Patient summary The ASIST trial randomized 27 men on active surveillance with low-grade prostate cancer diagnosed within the last year to systematic biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with systematic and targeted biopsy. The initial report showed little benefit from targeted biopsy. However, after 2 yr of follow-up we found that baseline MRI before confirmatory biopsy resulted in 50% fewer failures of surveillance and less progression to higher-grade cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) could be eligible for TOP1 inhibitors given the considerable proportion of tumors with a defect in HR-mediated repair (BRCAness). The TOP1 inhibitor irinotecan was tested in 4 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of TNBC. BRCAness was determined with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay, and expression of Schlafen family member 1 (SLFN11) and retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry analyses. In addition, the combination of irinotecan and the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor VE-822 was tested in SLFN11-negative PDXs, and two clinical non-camptothecin TOP1 inhibitors (LMP400 and LMP776) were tested. Thirty-eight percent of the TNBC models responded to irinotecan. BRCAness combined with high SLFN11 expression and RB1 loss identified highly sensitive tumors, consistent with the notion that deficiencies in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair result in high sensitivity to TOP1 inhibitors. Treatment by the ATR inhibitor VE-822 increased sensitivity to irinotecan in SLFN11-negative PDXs and abolished irinotecan-induced phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). LMP40 (indotecan) and LMP77 (indimitecan) showed high antitumor activity in BRCA1-mutated or BRCAness-positive PDXs. Last, low SLFN11 expression was associated with poor survival in 25 patients with TNBC treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of TNBC respond to irinotecan.

However, this rule will also induce a significant prediction error, especially when the off-line training instances are abundant, or the true RULs of the on-line test instances are large. Thus, an ensemble approach that integrates the RUL estimations obtained from the similarity-based curve matching techniques, with and without the zero-centering rules, is introduced to increase the robustness and accuracy of proposed method for RUL estimations. We evaluate the prognostic performance of the ensemble algorithm and standalone algorithms on four publicly available turbofan engine degradation datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach gives more robust and reliable RUL estimations compared to any independent algorithm used on all the studied datasets.",2020-07-01,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,https://openalex.org/V202403813,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2020.106926,106926,106926,199,,0,59,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011803685,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2020.106926,journal-article,3011803685

To do so, they are applying green marketing strategies to help gain competitive advantage and appeal to ecologically conscious consumers. However, not all green marketing claims accurately reflect firms’ environmental conduct, and can be viewed as ‘greenwashing’. Greenwashing may not only affect a company’s profitability, but more importantly, result in ethical harm. Therefore, this research extends past greenwashing studies by examining additional influences on and outcomes of perceived greenwashing. To do so, we conducted two studies, an interview study with consumer product and consulting firms, as well as an experiment examining consumers interacting with a company website. For these studies, we used multiple methods, including interviews, questionnaires, and neurophysiological techniques. We found that perceived greenwashing relates not only to environmental and product perceptions, but also to consumers’ happiness while interacting with the website. We also found that website interactivity relates to perceived greenwashing, environmental and product perceptions, and to the amount of interaction with the website.

The U–Pb age documents the timing of zircon crystallization/recrystallization and Hf isotopes inform on the degree to which the host melt was derived from a radiogenic reservoir (e.g. depleted mantle) versus an unradiogenic reservoir (e.g. ancient continental crust), or some mixture of these sources. The ease of generating large quantities of zircon U–Pb and Lu–Hf data has been in large part facilitated by instrument advances. However, the dramatic increase in time constrained zircon Lu–Hf analyses in the Earth science community has brought to the fore the importance of careful data collection and reduction workflows, onto which robust geological interpretations may be based. In this work, we discuss the fundamentals of Lu–Hf isotopes in zircon, which then allows us to provide a robust, accessible, methodology for the assessment of data quality.

Despite its pervasive adoption, there is substantial variability between studies in relation to experimental protocols, procedures for data analysis, and interpretation of findings. This guideline results from a collegial discussion among physiologists and pharmacologists, with the goal of providing general as well as specific recommendations regarding the conduct of human studies involving Doppler ultrasound-based measures of resistance vessel function in skeletal muscle.

To avoid exertional dyspnea, many patients adopt a sedentary lifestyle which predictably leads to extensive skeletal muscle deconditioning, social isolation, and its negative psychological sequalae. This ""dyspnea spiral"" is well documented and it is no surprise that alleviation of this distressing symptom has become a key objective highlighted across COPD guidelines. In reality, this important goal is often difficult to achieve, and successful symptom management awaits a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of dyspnea and how these can be therapeutically manipulated for the patients' benefit. Current theoretical constructs of the origins of activity-related dyspnea generally endorse the classical demand-capacity imbalance theory. Thus, it is believed that disruption of the normally harmonious relationship between inspiratory neural drive (IND) to breathe and the simultaneous dynamic response of the respiratory system fundamentally shapes the expression of respiratory discomfort in COPD. Sadly, the symptom of dyspnea cannot be eliminated in patients with advanced COPD with relatively fixed pathophysiological impairment. However, there is evidence that effective symptom palliation is possible for many. Interventions that reduce IND, without compromising alveolar ventilation (VA), or that improve respiratory mechanics and muscle function, or that address the affective dimension, achieve measurable benefits. A common final pathway of dyspnea relief and improved exercise tolerance across the range of therapeutic interventions (bronchodilators, exercise training, ambulatory oxygen, inspiratory muscle training, and opiate medications) is reduced neuromechanical dissociation of the respiratory system. These interventions, singly and in combination, partially restore more harmonious matching of excessive IND to ventilatory output achieved. In this review we propose, on the basis of a thorough review of the recent literature, that effective dyspnea amelioration requires combined interventions and a structured multidisciplinary approach, carefully tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual.",2020-01-01,Advances in Therapy,https://openalex.org/V27230875,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-019-01128-9,41,60,37,1,1,45,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983410614,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-019-01128-9,journal-article,2983410614

CHIP associates with a wide range of comorbidities from atherosclerosis to pulmonary disease. A growing body of evidence, primarily from studies involving Tet2-knockout and stem cell transplant models of CH, suggest that dysregulated inflammation contributes to clonal expansion and associated comorbidities. Mutant leukocytes from animal models contribute to an inflammatory milieu that may confer a selective advantage to the clone, thus perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and expansion. Although it is unclear whether inflammation or expansion sets this cycle in motion, some evidence suggests that inflammation from infections or pre-existing comorbidities initiates this cycle. The pro-inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages from mutant clones and their contributions to disease are well characterized in murine models, but have not yet been confirmed in humans. Furthermore, the roles of other cell types that can carry mutations of CHIP are not fully understood. We propose a rationale for further investigation of neutrophils, other granulocytes and T, B, and NK cells as they may play a role in CHIP-associated comorbidities.

Public safety personnel barriers to care-seeking include the stigma associated with mental disorders and frequent reports of insufficient access to care. To better understand barriers to care-seeking, we thematically analyzed the optional open-ended final comments provided by over 828 Canadian public safety personnel as part of a larger online survey designed to assess the prevalence of mental disorders among public safety personnel. Our results indicated that systematic processes may have (1) shaped public safety personnel decisions for care-seeking, (2) influenced how care-seekers were viewed by their colleagues, and (3) encouraged under-awareness of personal mental health needs. We described how public safety personnel who do seek care may be viewed by others; in particular, we identified widespread participant suspicion that coworkers who took the time to address their mental health needs were “abusing the system.” We explored what constitutes “abusing the system” and how organizational structures—systematic processes within different public safety organizations—might facilitate such notions of abuse. We found that understaffing may increase scrutiny of injured public safety personnel by those left to manage the additional burden; in addition, cynicism and unacknowledged structural stigma may emerge, preventing the other public safety personnel from identifying their mental health needs and seeking help.

This paper explores some common perceptions about GCL behaviour and then examines the misconceptions that can arise and their implications. It demonstrates how what may first appear obvious is not always as one expects and that more is not always better. It discusses: (i) the pore structure of a GCL, (ii) the dependency of the water retention curve of the GCL on its structure, bentonite particle sizes and applied stress, (iii) the effect of the subgrade pore water chemistry, (iv) the mineralogy of the subgrade, and (v) thermal effects. The desirability of a GCL being reasonably well-hydrated before being permeated is examined. The critical size of needle-punch bundles at which preferential flow can increase hydraulic conductivity by orders of magnitude is illustrated. The dependency of self-healing of holes on the interaction between GCL and subgrade is discussed.

However, the strength of surrogacy for those measures was not formally assessed. Using the case example of breast cancer, we aimed to evaluate the strength of correlation of surrogate measures listed in the FDA's Table with overall survival.This cross-sectional study of the FDA's Table of Surrogate Endpoints was conducted in May 2019. All surrogate measures listed in the FDA table as appropriate for accelerated or regular approval for breast cancer were extracted. We identified studies evaluating the correlation of treatment benefit in the surrogate with treatment benefit in overall survival and extracted results from the correlation analysis.Five surrogate endpoints were listed for breast cancer in the FDA website: pathological complete response rates (pCR), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), objective response rates (ORR), and progression-free survival (PFS), of which pCR was listed as appropriate only for accelerated approval, while the rest were considered appropriate for accelerated or regular approval. No correlation study evaluated the correlation of treatment effects on EFS with that on OS. The results from correlation studies evaluating pCR, DFS, ORR, and PFS suggest that the treatment effects on none of these surrogate measures were strongly correlated with treatment effects on OS (r<0.85 or R2 < 0.7, except for DFS in HER2 positive early breast cancer (R2 = 0.75).Using breast cancer as an example, we evaluated the underlying evidence for the surrogate endpoints for solid tumors listed in the FDA's Table of Surrogate Endpoints and found weak or missing correlations of treatment effects on these surrogates with treatment effects on OS . Surrogate measures should be predictive of clinical benefit to be useful in supporting regular FDA approval.Work on this project was funded by the Arnold Ventures.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify studies that investigated the relationship between T2D and VFs. Cohorts providing individual participant data (IPD) were also included. Estimates from published summary data and IPD cohorts were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with T2D and VFs. RESULTS Across 1 studies comprising 852,705 men and women, individuals with T2D had lower risk of prevalent (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% CI 0.74–0.95]; I2 = 0.0%; Phet = 0.54) but increased risk of incident VFs (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.27–1.44]; I2 = 0.6%; Phet = 0.43). In the IPD cohorts (N = 19,820), risk of nonvertebral fractures was higher in those with both T2D and VFs compared with those without T2D or VFs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% CI 1.86–3.15]) or with VFs (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.32–2.27]) or T2D (HR 1.9 [95% CI 1.46–2.59]) alone. Individuals with both T2D and VFs had increased mortality compared with individuals without T2D and VFs (HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.72–2.59]) or with VFs alone (HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.49–2.28]) and borderline increased compared with individuals with T2D alone (HR 1.2 [95% CI 0.99–1.52]). CONCLUSIONS Based on our findings, individuals with T2D should be systematically assessed for presence of VFs, and, as in individuals without T2D, their presence constitutes an indication to start osteoporosis treatment for the prevention of future fractures.",2020-01-01,Diabetes Care,https://openalex.org/V49878492,American Diabetes Association,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc19-0925,137,144,43,1,1,39,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981562883,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc19-0925,journal-article,2981562883

The recommendations came out of an interdisciplinary workshop on the measurement of well-being. The recommendations are shaped around the number of items that can be included in a survey, and also based on the differing potential contexts and purposes of data collection such as, for example, government surveys, or multi-use cohort studies, or studies specifically about psychological well-being.

Taking advantage of the chiral transfer from the intrinsically planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes, we herein present an efficient and straightforward approach to achieve early examples of highly luminescent chiral systems (P5NN and P5BN). The optical resolution of their enantiomers has been carried out via preparative chiral HPLC, which was ascribed to the molecular functionalization of pillar[5]arenes with π-conjugated, sterically bulky triarylamine (Ar3 N) as an electron donor and triarylborane (Ar3 B) as an acceptor. This crucial design enabled investigations of the chiroptical properties, including circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state.

We report that in breast cancer cells NANOG , SNAIL and NODAL transcripts manifest multiple isoforms characterized by different 5’ Untranslated Regions (5’UTRs), whereby translation of a subset of these isoforms is stimulated under hypoxia. The accumulation of the corresponding proteins induces plasticity and “fate-switching” toward stem cell-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, we observe that mTOR inhibitors and chemotherapeutics induce translational activation of a subset of NANOG , SNAIL and NODAL mRNA isoforms akin to hypoxia, engendering stem-cell-like phenotypes. These effects are overcome with drugs that antagonize translational reprogramming caused by eIF2α phosphorylation (e.g. ISRIB), suggesting that the Integrated Stress Response drives breast cancer plasticity. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism of induction of plasticity of breast cancer cells and provide a molecular basis for therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming drug resistance and abrogating metastasis.",2020-05-19,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16352-z,,,11,1,1,39,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3026944009,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16352-z,journal-article,3026944009

Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway has been implicated in a broad range of human cancer types. While a number of stimuli affecting the Hippo pathway have been reported, its upstream kinase and extracellular regulators remain largely unknown. Here we performed the first comprehensive gain-of-functional screen for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulating the Hippo pathway using an RTK overexpression library and a Hippo signaling activity biosensor. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of RTKs could regulate the Hippo signaling activity. We further characterized several of these novel relationships [TAM family members (TYRO3, AXL, METRK), RET, and FGFR family members (FGFR1 and FGFR2)] and found that the Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ are central mediators of the tumorigenic phenotypes (e.g., increased cell proliferation, transformation, increased cell motility, and angiogenesis) induced by these RTKs and their extracellular ligands (Gas6, GDNF, and FGF) through either PI3K or MAPK signaling pathway. Significantly, we identify FGFR, RET, and MERTK as the first RTKs that can directly interact with and phosphorylate YAP/TAZ at multiple tyrosine residues independent of upstream Hippo signaling, thereby activating their functions in tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we have identified several novel kinases and extracellular stimuli regulating the Hippo pathway. Our findings also highlight the pivotal role of the Hippo pathway in mediating Gas6/GDNF/FGF-TAM/RET/FGFR-MAPK/PI3K signaling during tumorigenesis and provide a compelling rationale for targeting YAP/TAZ in RTK-driven cancers.",2020-01-01,Oncogene,https://openalex.org/V128439998,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-019-0988-y,334,355,39,2,0,38,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970147023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-019-0988-y,journal-article,2970147023

Mitochondrial fission is mainly mediated by dynamin-related protein  (Drp1), a large GTPase. The GTPase activity of Drp1 is essential for its fissogenic activity. Therefore, we aimed to identify Drp1 inhibitors and evaluate their anti-neoplastic and cardioprotective properties in five cancer cell lines (A549, SK-MES-1, SK-LU-1, SW 900, and MCF7) and an experimental cardiac IR injury model. Virtual screening of a chemical library revealed 1 compounds with high predicted affinity to the GTPase domain of Drp1. In silico screening identified an ellipticine compound, Drpitor1, as a putative, potent Drp1 inhibitor. We also synthesized a congener of Drpitor1 to remove the methoxymethyl group and reduce hydrolytic lability (Drpitor1a). Drpitor1 and Drpitor1a inhibited the GTPase activity of Drp1 without inhibiting the GTPase of dynamin 1. Drpitor1 and Drpitor1a have greater potency than the current standard Drp1 GTPase inhibitor, mdivi-1, (IC50 for mitochondrial fragmentation are 0.09, 0.06, and 1 μM, respectively). Both Drpitors reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Drpitor1a suppressed lung cancer tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Drpitor1a also inhibited mitochondrial ROS production, prevented mitochondrial fission, and improved right ventricular diastolic dysfunction during IR injury. In conclusion, Drpitors are useful tools for understanding mitochondrial dynamics and have therapeutic potential in treating cancer and cardiac IR injury.",2020-01-01,The FASEB Journal,https://openalex.org/V25293849,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.201901467r,1447,1464,34,1,0,38,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992232652,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.201901467r,journal-article,2992232652

In this paper, a simple and economical leaching process based on citric acid system was developed for the leaching of metals from the industrial waste LIBs without the manual separation of current collectors, i.e. copper and aluminum foils. The results showed significantly higher leaching efficiencies of metals due to the presence of copper and aluminum. About 91% Li, 90% Co, 94% Ni and 89% Mn were leached under the optimum leaching conditions of 0.5 mol/L citric acid, solid to liquid (S/L) ratio of 80 g/L at 90 °C for 80 min. Furthermore, the effects of the addition time and species of reductant on the leaching of Li, Co, Ni, and Mn were investigated, and the selectivity over Cu and Al as well. The kinetics data revealed that the leaching of Li, Co, Ni and Mn fitted best to the Avrami equation controlled by the surface chemical reaction, whilst the leaching of Cu and Al corresponded to the surface chemical-controlled reaction based on shrinking core model.

Methods This review used (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA guidelines and in-depth searches in four databases (1954-2016; Ovid-based Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL) to identify articles on the prevalence of depression and/or anxiety in adult SLE patients. Included studies were critically appraised and analyzed. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was studied for all included studies, and whenever possible, pooled prevalence (PP) was determined for more commonly used metrics. Statistical and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Result A total of 310 references were identified, 22 were selected for detailed review and 7 were included in the final analysis. Overall Prevalence The depression PP, obtained from 6 studies representing 23,386 SLE patients, was 35.0% (95% CI: 29.9%-40.3%). The anxiety PP, obtained from 3 studies representing 443 SLE patients, was 25.8% (95% CI: 19.2%-32.9%). Prevalence per metrics used The more commonly used instruments included the Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS-A/D), and Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression/Anxiety (HAM-D/A)]. The CES-D was utilized in 1 studies including 185 SLE patients; depression PP was 41.5% (95% CI: 35.1%-48.1%). The BDI was utilized in 14 studies including 13 SLE patients and the BAI in  studies including 4 patients; depression PP was 39.9% (95% CI: 31.1%-49.1) and anxiety PP was 38.4% (95% CI: 34.2%-42.8%). The HADS-D was utilized in 1 studies including 12 SLE patients and the HADS-A in  studies including 10 patients respectively; it's depression PP was 24.4% (95% CI: 19.1%-30.1%) and anxiety PP was 38.3% (95% CI: 29.1%-47.9%). The HAM-D was utilized in  studies including 2 SLE patients and the HAM-A in  studies including 2 patients respectively; its depression PP was 40.0% (95% CI: 23.0%-59.0%) and anxiety PP was 39.0% (95% CI: 32.0%-45.0%). Conclusion There was high variability in the prevalence of depression and anxiety, ranging from 8.7%-78.6% and 1.1%-71.4%, respectively. This could be attributed to the lack of consistency in the metrics used and its definition for depression and anxiety in SLE. Studies that used a specific metric, such as the CES-D, BDI or HAM-D, yielded similar depression prevalence. The HADS-D had the lowest prevalence.

In May 201 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups—scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth—launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 15 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of  million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1] . A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not.

Hereditary cases are associated with germline mutations in BMPR2 and 1 other genes; however, these mutations occur in <25% of patients with idiopathic PAH and are rare in PAH associated with connective tissue diseases. Preclinical studies suggest epigenetic dysregulation, including altered DNA methylation, promotes PAH. Somatic mutations of Tet-methylcytosine-dioxygenase-2 (TET2), a key enzyme in DNA demethylation, occur in cardiovascular disease and are associated with clonal hematopoiesis, inflammation, and adverse vascular remodeling. The role of TET2 in PAH is unknown.To test for a role of TET2, we used a cohort of 257 cases from the PAH Biobank. Within this cohort, gene-specific rare variant association tests were performed using 183 unrelated European patients with PAH and 750 non-Finnish European subjects from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) as control subjects. In an independent cohort of 14 patients, we quantified TET2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To assess causality, we investigated hemodynamic and histological evidence of PAH in hematopoietic Tet2-knockout mice.We observed an increased burden of rare, predicted deleterious germline variants in TET2 in PAH patients of European ancestry (9/1832) compared with control subjects (6/7509; relative risk=6; P=0.00067). Assessing the whole cohort, 0.39% of patients (10/2572) had 1 TET2 mutations (75% predicted germline and 25% somatic). These patients had no mutations in other PAH-related genes. Patients with TET2 mutations were older (71±7 years versus 48±19 years; P<0.0001), were more unresponsive to vasodilator challenge (0/7 versus 140/1055 [13.2%]), had lower pulmonary vascular resistance (5.2±3.1 versus 10.5±7.0 Wood units; P=0.02), and had increased inflammation (including elevation of interleukin-1β). Circulating TET2 expression did not correlate with age and was decreased in >86% of PAH patients. Tet2-knockout mice spontaneously developed PAH, adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling, and inflammation, with elevated levels of cytokines, including interleukin-1β. Long-term therapy with an antibody targeting interleukin-1β blockade resulted in regression of PAH.PAH is the first human disease related to potential TET2 germline mutations.

The two initially equal half-cells of the device consist of a reduced graphene oxide hydrogel which encapsulates vanadium ions, synthesized with a single-step method. During charge, the oxidation state of the vanadium ions changes, resulting in two half-cells with different potentials which considerably increases the energy density. The achieved maximum capacity of more than 22 mAh g−1 is roughly eight times higher than that of comparable graphene hydrogel supercapacitors without vanadium content, but the potentiostatic charging time is only double. Operated as a supercapacitor, it retains 95% of the initial capacitance over 100 cycles. As battery, the losses are more significant, retaining around 50% of the initial capacity. However, these losses during battery operation can be almost entirely restored by electric measures. The vanadium ion addition also improves the self-discharge characteristics of the device. Moreover, the self-discharge does not permanently damage the hybrid device since both half-cells initially consist of the same vanadium graphene hydrogel and discharging resets it to initial conditions.",2020-03-23,Advanced Functional Materials,https://openalex.org/V135204980,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201910738,1910738,1910738,30,21,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012661203,https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201910738,journal-article,3012661203

Here we present a metabolic model-based machine learning classifier, named Metabolic Allele Classifier (MAC), that uses flux balance analysis to estimate the biochemical effects of alleles. We apply the MAC to a dataset of 1595 drug-tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and show that MACs predict AMR phenotypes with accuracy on par with mechanism-agnostic machine learning models (isoniazid AUC = 0.93) while enabling a biochemical interpretation of the genotype-phenotype map. Interpretation of MACs for three antibiotics (pyrazinamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid) recapitulates known AMR mechanisms and suggest a biochemical basis for how the identified alleles cause AMR.

This study aimed to evaluate the real-world experience of patients recommended the diet. METHODS This case-series interviewed FGID patients attending a gastroenterology clinic with previous recommendation to trial the low FODMAP diet, examining who recommended the diet and what their percentage improvement was. To evaluate implementation of the diet's  phases, questions were constructed based on current literature and clinical guidelines regarding length of initial restriction and food knowledge (Phase-1), number of foods re-challenged (Phase-2) and food re-introduction as tolerated (Phase-3). The comprehensive nutrition assessment questionnaire provided daily FODMAP intake. Data were analyzed using chi-squared tests. KEY RESULTS In 8 patients (21 male), the diet was recommended by the gastroenterologist in 53%, general practitioner 22%, dietitian 9% and other 15%. 30% saw a dietitian for guidance. 55% reported a ≥50% symptom improvement.

Here, we report the reconstruction and modelling of a genome-scale metabolic network of Medicago truncatula (plant) nodulated by Sinorhizobium meliloti (bacterium). The reconstructed nodule tissue contains five spatially distinct developmental zones and encompasses the metabolism of both the plant and the bacterium. Flux balance analysis (FBA) suggests that the metabolic costs associated with symbiotic nitrogen fixation are primarily related to supporting nitrogenase activity, and increasing N 2 -fixation efficiency is associated with diminishing returns in terms of plant growth. Our analyses support that differentiating bacteroids have access to sugars as major carbon sources, ammonium is the main nitrogen export product of N 2 -fixing bacteria, and N 2 fixation depends on proton transfer from the plant cytoplasm to the bacteria through acidification of the peribacteroid space. We expect that our model, called ‘Virtual Nodule Environment’ (ViNE), will contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of legume nodules, and may guide experimental studies and engineering of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.",2020-05-22,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16484-2,,,11,1,1,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3027379668,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16484-2,journal-article,3027379668

More importantly, a method for incorporating the low-surface-tension liquid poly(dimethyl siloxane), PDMS, into the new polyurethane formulation is reported. The final polyurethane coating bearing a liquid-like PDMS monolayer on its surface and nanometer-sized PDMS pools in its matrix is transparent and exhibits superior oil and water repellency. On the coating, various test liquids with surface tensions above ~22 mN/m cleanly glide at low substrate tilt angles and complex fluids such as ink and paint samples readily contract.

Treatments such as acid leaching, reaction of tailings with elevated concentrations of gaseous CO2, and optimization of tailings pore water saturation have been shown to enhance CO2 sequestration rates in laboratory settings. The next challenge is to deploy treatment technologies on the pilot and field scale while minimizing cost, energy input, and adverse environmental impacts. Implementation of accelerated tailings carbonation at field scale will ideally make use of in situ treatments or modified ore-processing routes that employ conventional technology and expertise and operate at close to ambient temperatures and pressures. Here, we describe column experiments designed to trial two geochemical treatments that address these criteria: (1) direct reaction of partially saturated ultramafic tailings with synthetic flue gas from power generation (10% CO2 in N2) and (2) repeated heap leaching of ultramafic tailings with dilute sulfuric acid. In the first experiment, we report rapid carbonation of brucite [Mg(OH)2] in the presence of 10% CO2 gas within tailings sampled from the Woodsreef chrysotile mine, New South Wales, Australia. Within four weeks, we observe a doubling of the amount of CO2 stored within minerals relative to what is achieved after three decades of passive mineral carbonation via air capture in the field. Our simulated heap leaching experiments, treated daily with 0.08 M H2SO4, produce high-Mg leachates that have the potential to sequester 21.2 kg CO2 m–2 y–1, which is approximately one to two orders of magnitude higher than the rate of passive carbonation of the Woodsreef mine tailings. Although some nesquehonite (MgCO3 · 3H2O) forms from these leachates, most of the Mg is precipitated as Mg sulfate minerals instead. Therefore, an acid other than H2SO4 could be used; otherwise, sulfate removal would be required to maximize CO2 sequestration potential from acid heap leaching treatments. Reactive transport modeling (MIN3P) is employed to simulate acid leaching experiments and predict the effects of heap leaching for up to five years. Finally, our synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy results for leached tailings material reveal that valuable trace metals (Fe, Ni, Mn, Co, Cr) become highly concentrated within secondary Fe (hydr)oxide minerals at the pH neutralization horizon within our column experiments. This discrete horizon migrates downward, and our reactive transport models indicate it will become increasingly enriched in first-row transition metals in response to continued acid leaching. Acid-leaching treatments for accelerated mineral carbonation could therefore be useful for ore processing and recovery of base metals from tailings, waste rock, or low-grade ores.",2020-03-01,Economic geology and the bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists,https://openalex.org/V4210182989,Society of Economic Geologists,https://doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4710,303,323,115,2,0,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012217150,https://doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4710,journal-article,3012217150

When triaging a bug report, developers must decide whether the bug report is valid (i.e., a real bug). A large amount of bug reports are submitted every day, with many of them end up being invalid reports. Manually determining valid bug report is a difficult and tedious task. Thus, an approach that can automatically analyze the validity of a bug report and determine whether a report is valid can help developers prioritize their triaging tasks and avoid wasting time and effort on invalid bug reports. In this study, motivated by the above needs, we propose an approach which can determine whether a newly submitted bug report is valid . Our approach first extracts 3 features from bug reports. The extracted features are grouped along  dimensions, i.e., reporter experience, collaboration network, completeness, readability and text. Based on these features, we use a random forest classifier to identify valid bug reports. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we experiment on large-scale datasets containing a total of 560,697 bug reports from five open source projects (i.e., Eclipse, Netbeans, Mozilla, Firefox and Thunderbird). On average, across the five datasets, our approach achieves an F1-score for valid bug reports and F1-score for invalid ones of 0.74 and 0.67, respectively. Moreover, our approach achieves an average AUC of 0.81. In terms of AUC and F1-scores for valid and invalid bug reports, our approach statistically significantly outperforms two baselines using features that are proposed by Zanetti et al. [104] .

The results revealed that the weld was fabricated by a back-extrusion and forging process, and the material flow in the vertical direction created a mechanical inter-locking joining mechanism. During the sleeve plunging period, a constant thickness of dynamic recrystallization layer of Al 6022 sheet material was trapped underneath the sleeve bottom, and a drop region was formed at the sleeve outer periphery. Dissimilar intermixing was formed during the retraction period, in which the grooved sleeve facilitated the formation of intermixed microstructure comprising intermingled dissimilar lamellae adjacent to the rotating sleeve. Cracking caused by local melting of ŋ (MgZn2) phase particles was formed in the stir zone, which disappeared after welding process.

In fact, a number of regulatory proteins have emerged as important players in skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and many of these proteins share key attributes with PGC-1α. In an effort to move past the simplistic notion of a “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis, we highlight the regulatory mechanisms by which nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ), PPARβ, and leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRP130) may contribute to the control of skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. We also present evidence supporting/refuting the ability of sulforaphane, quercetin, and epicatechin to promote skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and their potential to augment mitochondrial training adaptations. Targeted activation of specific pathways by these compounds may allow for greater mechanistic insight into the molecular pathways controlling mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle. Dietary activation of mitochondrial biogenesis may also be useful in clinical populations with basal reductions in mitochondrial protein content, enzyme activities, and/or respiratory function as well as individuals who exhibit a blunted skeletal muscle responsiveness to contractile activity.

Early studies focused on refining the technique and avoiding incomplete myotomy. Following the discovery that many patients with abnormal acid exposure are asymptomatic, the focus shifted to post-POEM reflux, but no studies have identified any associated procedural factors. In this study, we examined the intermediate-term results of our previous randomized controlled trial, with particular attention to post-POEM reflux. Previously, 10 consecutive patients were randomized to either double- or single-scope POEM. Endoscopy was conducted 2 months post-POEM and annually thereafter. Patients were included in the present study if they completed endoscopy ≥ 6 months post-POEM, and the clinical results of both groups were analyzed with particular attention to clinical efficacy and post-POEM reflux. Median follow-up was 3 years, and most myotomies were performed in the posterior location. The final gastric myotomy length was longer in the double-scope group (3.3 vs. 2.6 cm). Clinical efficacy (≥ 80%) and rates of post-POEM reflux (~ 60%) were similar; however, there was a higher incidence of moderate esophagitis (Los Angeles Grade B) in the double-scope group (25% vs. 4%). There were no cases of severe esophagitis (Los Angeles Grade C/D). Among patients with normal endoscopy at  months, > 40% developed erosive esophagitis on intermediate-term follow-up. This is the first study to demonstrate a procedural factor that increases post-POEM esophagitis. Gastric myotomy > 2.5 cm results in increased rates of moderate esophagitis without improving clinical efficacy. Some patients developed esophagitis in a delayed fashion, emphasizing the importance of ongoing surveillance. We also believe that preserving the gastric sling fibers may help to reduce reflux rates. The double-scope method may help to control myotomy length (2.0–2.5 cm) and direction (lesser curve to avoid the gastric sling) to help maximize clinical efficacy while minimizing post-POEM reflux.",2020-07-01,Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques,https://openalex.org/V47192491,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07079-0,2963,2968,34,7,0,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970881501,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07079-0,journal-article,2970881501

First, combined with digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE) equipment, quantities of uniaxial compression tests on brittle prismatic sandstone samples containing a circular, inverted U-shaped, trapezoid, rectangular or square hole were conducted to study the strength, deformation and fracture characteristics. After that, the analytical solutions of stress for the five types of holes were derived using complex variable function theory. The experimental results suggest that the mechanical properties of the samples are greatly weakened by the existence of the holes, and the degradation degree depends on the hole shape. The stability order of these holes is ranked as: circle > inverted U-shape > trapezoidal > square > rectangle. According to the formation mechanism and sequence, four types of cracks, namely, primary tensile cracks, slabbing fractures, remote cracks and shear cracks, are formed around all the holes, but the crack sequence, initiation location and propagation characteristics of each hole are slightly different. The variation of AE signals matches well with the fracture evolution. The shear failure mode results from the coalescence of the shear cracks and V-shaped notches. Theoretical analysis shows that crack development mechanism can be well interpreted by the stress distributions around the holes.

In this study, the results obtained from the single minerals experiments showed an excellent selectivity with high recoveries for magnesite using PCP as the collector in contrast to the case with dolomite. The separation effect of the binary mixtures at pulp pH 9.0 was also investigated. The results confirmed that the PCP is an appropriate collector for the flotation separation of magnesite from dolomite. Surface chemical aspects of the separation mechanism were investigated through measurements of zeta potential, contact angle, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The results support the flotation selectivity observed and are consistent with chemisorption of PCP on magnesite in the presence of sodium silicate that was used as a modifier to stabilize hydrophilicity of dolomite and remove its adverse effect on the recovery of magnesite.",2020-04-01,Applied Surface Science,https://openalex.org/V42323631,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.145191,145191,145191,508,,0,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997033762,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.145191,journal-article,2997033762

Individual differences in emotional variability are thought to reflect the core of neuroticism. However, the empirical relation between emotional variability and neuroticism may be partially the result of a measurement artifact reflecting neuroticism’s relation with higher mean levels—rather than greater variability—of negative emotion. When emotional intensity is measured using bounded scales, there is a dependency between variability and mean levels: at low (or high) intensity, it is impossible to demonstrate high variability. As neuroticism is positively associated with mean levels of negative emotion, this may account for the relation between neuroticism and emotional variability. In a metaanalysis of 11 studies ( N = 1,205 participants; 83,411 observations), we tested whether the association between neuroticism and negative emotional variability was clouded by a dependency between variability and the mean. We found a medium-sized positive association between neuroticism and negative emotional variability, but, when using a relative variability index to correct for mean negative emotion, this association disappeared. This indicated that neuroticism was associated with experiencing more intense, but not more variable, negative emotions. Our findings call into question theory, measurement scales, and data suggesting that emotional variability is central to neuroticism. In doing so, they provide a revisionary perspective for understanding how this individual difference may predispose to mental and physical disorders.",2020-04-28,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919934117,9270,9276,117,17,1,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016402220,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919934117,journal-article,3016402220

Research on the effect of microcystins on invertebrates is inconclusive; from one perspective, studies suggest invertebrates can coexist in toxic blooms; however, studies have also measured negative food-associated effects from microcystins. To test the latter perspective, we examined the reproduction, growth, and survival of laboratory-cultured Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, and Hexagenia spp. exposed to cell-bound microcystins through a series of life-cycle bioassays. Test organisms were exposed to a concentration gradient ranging from 0.5 μg L-1 to 300 μg L-1 microcystins, which corresponds to values typically found in freshwaters during bloom season. Lethal concentrations in C. dubia (LC50 = 5.53 μg L-1) and D. magna (LC50 = 85.72 μg L-1) exposed to microcystins were among the lowest recorded to date, and reproductive effects were observed at concentrations as low as 2.5 μg L-1. Length of D. magna was significantly impacted in microcystin treatments great than 2.5 μg L-1. No lethality or growth impairments were observed in Hexagenia.

Unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys can provide a contemporary data product between the two end‐members of coverage and resolution attained using manned airborne and terrestrial magnetic surveys. This new data product is achievable because unmanned aerial vehicle platforms can safely traverse with magnetometer payloads at flight elevations closer to ground targets than manned airborne surveys, while also delivering an increased coverage rate compared to walking conventional terrestrial surveys. This is a promising new development for geophysical and mineral exploration applications, especially in variable terrains. A three‐dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic survey was conducted within the Shebandowan Greenstone Belt, northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, in July 2017. A series of two‐dimensional grids (∼500 m × 70 m) were flown at approximate elevations of 35, 4 and 7 m above ground level using a Da‐Jiāng Innovations multi‐rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (S900) and a GEM Systems, Inc., Potassium Vapour Magnetometer (GSMP‐35U). In total, over 4 line‐km of unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic data were flown with a line spacing of 2 m. The collected aeromagnetic data were compared to a regional heliborne aeromagnetic survey flown at an elevation of approximately 8 m above the terrain, with a line spacing of 10 m, as well as a follow‐up terrestrial magnetic survey. The first vertical derivative of the gathered unmanned aerial vehicle total magnetic field data was calculated both directly between each of the different flight elevations, and indirectly by calculating the values predicted using upward continuation. This case study demonstrates that low flight elevation unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys can reliably collect industry standard total magnetic field measurements at an increased resolution when compared to manned airborne magnetic surveys. The enhanced interpretation potential provided by this approach also aided in delineating structural controls and hydrothermal fluid migration pathways (a pair of adjacent shear zones) related to gold mineralization on site. These structural features were not clearly resolved in the regional manned airborne magnetic data alone, further demonstrating the utility of applying high‐resolution unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys to mineral exploration applications. The conclusions and interpretations drawn from the unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic data, coupled with historical data, were applied to make a new gold mineralization discovery on the site, assayed at 15.7 g/t.",2020-01-01,Geophysical Prospecting,https://openalex.org/V45030768,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2478.12914,,,,,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994262534,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2478.12914,journal-article,2994262534

The hemophilia A community has deep experience with attempting to manage such deleterious immune responses, as the lifesaving protein drug factor VIII (FVIII) has been in use for decades. Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by genetic mutations that result in absent or dysfunctional FVIII. Prophylactic treatment consists of regular intravenous FVIII infusions. Unfortunately, 1/ to 1/ of patients develop neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies, referred to clinically as ""inhibitors,"" which result in a serious bleeding diathesis. Until recently, the only therapeutic option for these patients was ""Immune Tolerance Induction,"" consisting of intensive FVIII administration, which is extraordinarily expensive and fails in ~30% of cases. There has been tremendous recent progress in developing novel potential clinical alternatives for the treatment of hemophilia A, ranging from encouraging results of gene therapy trials, to use of other hemostatic agents (either promoting coagulation or slowing down anti-coagulant or fibrinolytic pathways) to ""bypass"" the need for FVIII or supplement FVIII replacement therapy. Although these approaches are promising, there is widespread agreement that preventing or reversing inhibitors remains a high priority. Risk profiles of novel therapies are still unknown or incomplete, and FVIII will likely continue to be considered the optimal hemostatic agent to support surgery and manage trauma, or to combine with other therapies. We describe here recent exciting studies, most still pre-clinical, that address FVIII immunogenicity and suggest novel interventions to prevent or reverse inhibitor development. Studies of FVIII uptake, processing and presentation on antigen-presenting cells, epitope mapping, and the roles of complement, heme, von Willebrand factor, glycans, and the microbiome in FVIII immunogenicity are elucidating mechanisms of primary and secondary immune responses and suggesting additional novel targets. Promising tolerogenic therapies include development of FVIII-Fc fusion proteins, nanoparticle-based therapies, oral tolerance, and engineering of regulatory or cytotoxic T cells to render them FVIII-specific. Importantly, these studies are highly applicable to other scenarios where establishing immune tolerance to a defined antigen is a clinical priority.",2020-01-10,Frontiers in Immunology,https://openalex.org/V2595292759,Frontiers Media SA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31998296/,2991,2991,10,,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999005745,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02991,journal-article,2999005745

We synthesize insights from the organizational perspective of corruption and the integration-responsiveness paradigm to propose that integration-oriented strategies will weaken the positive relationship between corruption and the likelihood of exit at high levels of host market corruption. We develop and test hypotheses pertaining to the main effect of corruption on the likelihood of subsidiary exit, as well as the moderating impacts of a firm’s equity ownership strategy and its expatriate staffing strategy upon this relationship. We theorize that uncertainty operates as the mechanism that underpins the corruption-market exit relationship, and that an MNE’s strategic choices with respect to its subsidiary investments contribute to reducing this uncertainty. We find that an increase in the foreign-investing MNE’s equity ownership share negatively moderates the positive relationship between corruption and the likelihood that foreign subsidiaries established by developed market MNEs will exit host emerging markets when corruption is high. However, the marginal effects results do not support the expatriate staffing strategy hypothesis.

2020,7,11,0,0.0,https://openalex.org/W3012114822,"Mitochondria in the Pulmonary Vasculature in Health and Disease: Oxygen‐Sensing, Metabolism, and Dynamics","In lung vascular cells, mitochondria serve a canonical metabolic role, governing energy homeostasis. In addition, mitochondria exist in dynamic networks, which serve noncanonical functions, including regulation of redox signaling, cell cycle, apoptosis, and mitochondrial quality control. Mitochondria in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) are oxygen sensors and initiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Acquired dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics contribute to a cancer-like phenotype in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Acquired mitochondrial abnormalities, such as increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate kinase muscle isoform  (PKM2) expression, which increase uncoupled glycolysis (the Warburg phenomenon), are implicated in PAH. Warburg metabolism sustains energy homeostasis by the inhibition of oxidative metabolism that reduces mitochondrial apoptosis, allowing unchecked cell accumulation. Warburg metabolism is initiated by the induction of a pseudohypoxic state, in which DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-mediated changes in redox signaling cause normoxic activation of HIF-1α and increase PDK expression. Furthermore, mitochondrial division is coordinated with nuclear division through a process called mitotic fission. Increased mitotic fission in PAH, driven by increased fission and reduced fusion favors rapid cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance. Downregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUC) occurs in PAH and is one potential unifying mechanism linking Warburg metabolism and mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial metabolic and dynamic disorders combine to promote the hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, phenotype in PAH PASMC, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Understanding the molecular mechanism regulating mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics has permitted identification of new biomarkers, nuclear and CT imaging modalities, and new therapeutic targets for PAH. © 202 American Physiological Society.

The quality of the underlying substrate strongly influences the growth of the perovskite layer. In turn, the perovskite film quality directly affects the efficiency and stability of the resultant PSCs.

In this review, metal oxide-based electron transport layers (ETLs) used in PSCs and their systemic modification are reviewed. The roles of ETLs in the design and fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs are also discussed.

While immense progress has been made in recent years on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying decision making, research on this topic is still largely split into two halves. Good-based models largely state that decisions are made between representations of abstract value associated with available options; while action-based models largely state that decisions are made at the level of action representations. These models are further divided between those that state that a decision is made before an action is specified, and those that regard decision making as an evolving process that continues until movement completion. Here, we review computational models, behavioral findings, and results from neural recordings associated with these frameworks. In synthesizing this literature, we submit that decision making is best understood as a continuous, graded, and distributed process that traverses a landscape of behaviorally relevant options, from their presentation until movement completion.

Our primary aim was to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between pharmacological cardioversion followed by electrical cardioversion (drug–shock), and electrical cardioversion alone (shock-only). Our secondary aim was to compare the effectiveness of two pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Methods We did a partial factorial trial of two protocols for patients with acute atrial fibrillation at 1 academic hospital emergency departments in Canada. We enrolled adult patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Protocol 1 was a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled comparison of attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide (1 mg/kg over 30 min) followed by electrical cardioversion if necessary (up to three shocks, each of ≥200 J), and placebo infusion followed by electrical cardioversion. For patients having electrical cardioversion, we used Protocol 2, a randomised, open-label, nested comparison of anteroposterior versus anterolateral pad positions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by study site) for Protocol 1 by on-site research personnel using an online electronic data capture system. Randomisation for Protocol 2 occurred 30 min after drug infusion for patients who had not converted and was stratified by site and Protocol 1 allocation. Patients and all research and emergency department staff were masked to treatment allocation for Protocol 1. The primary outcome was conversion to normal sinus rhythm for at least 30 min at any time after randomisation and up to a point immediately after three shocks. Protocol 1 was analysed by intention to treat and Protocol  excluded patients who did not receive electrical cardioversion. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891058. Findings Between July 18, 2013, and Oct 17, 2018, we enrolled 3 patients, and none were lost to follow-up. In the drug–shock group (n=204), conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 1 (96%) patients and in the shock-only group (n=192), conversion occurred in 1 (92%) patients (absolute difference 4%; 95% CI 0–9; p=0·07). The proportion of patients discharged home was 97% (n=198) versus 95% (n=183; p=0·60). 1 (52%) patients in the drug–shock group converted after drug infusion only. No patients had serious adverse events in follow-up. The different pad positions in Protocol  (n=244), had similar conversions to sinus rhythm (11 [94%] of 1 in anterolateral group vs 1 [92%] of 1 in anteroposterior group; p=0·68). Interpretation Both the drug–shock and shock-only strategies were highly effective, rapid, and safe in restoring sinus rhythm for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation, avoiding the need for return to hospital. The drug infusion worked for about half of patients and avoided the resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion. We also found no significant difference between the anterolateral and anteroposterior pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Immediate rhythm control for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation leads to excellent outcomes.

This systematic review aims to assess the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes (preterm birth [PTB], low birth weight [LBW], small-for-gestationalage [SGA] and large for gestational-age [LGA]), in singleton pregnancies conceived by fresh or frozen embryo transfer (FET) compared to spontaneous conceptions. Methods Cohort studies were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library (January 2019), and manual search. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) using random effects models in RevMan 5.3 and I -squared ( I 2 ) test &gt; 50% was considered as high heterogeneity. Results After 31 titles and abstracts were screened, 11 full-text articles were assessed, and  were eligible. For fresh embryo transfer, the pooled ORs were PTB 1.6 (95% CI 1.46, 1.84); I 2 = 97%; LBW 1.6 (95% CI 1.52, 1.85); I 2 = 94%; SGA 1.4 [95% CI 1.11, 1.92]; I 2 = 99%, LGA 0.8 (95% CI 0.80, 0.87); I 2 = 80%).

However, it remains controversial as to whether the LLSVPs have been stationary through time or dynamic, changing in response to changes in global subduction geometry. Here we compile radiogenic isotope data on plume-induced basalts from ocean islands and oceanic plateaus above the two LLSVPs that show distinct lead, neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions for the two mantle domains. The African domain shows enrichment by subducted continental material during the assembly and breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, whereas no such feature is found in the Pacific domain. This deep-mantle geochemical dichotomy reflects the different evolutionary histories of the two domains during the Rodinia and Pangaea supercontinent cycles and thus supports a dynamic relationship between plate tectonics and deep-mantle structures. Earth’s deep-mantle domains are geochemically distinct.

PTSD is associated with significant disability, a large economic burden, and despite the range of therapies to treat PTSD, response to antidepressants is limited. A growing body of clinical research suggests the efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in individuals with treatment-refractory PTSD. Aim To assess the effectiveness and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reducing symptoms of PTSD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Methods Six online databases were searched from inception to December 2018. Reference lists of relevant articles were manually searched as well as electronic sources of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. Researchers active in the subject were also contacted. Eligible studies included randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care). We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Using random-effects meta-analysis with Cochrane’s Review Manager 5.3, we obtained standardized mean differences [SMD] and rate ratios [RR] for reduction in PTSD symptomatology. Results A total of  trials met inclusion criteria, totaling 10 participants (average age: 35-40 years, 70% female). Studies were rated as moderate in quality. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy demonstrated a high rate of clinical response (RR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.70, 7.06), remission (RR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.37, 5.02), with a large effect size at reducing the symptoms of PTSD (SMD = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.94). Available evidence indicates that MDMA was well-tolerated, with few serious adverse events reported across studies. Conclusions MDMA-assisted psychotherapy appears to be a potentially safe, effective, and durable treatment for individuals with chronic, treatment-refractory PTSD.

Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies in adolescents with BPD symptomatology. Methods: Seven electronic databases were systematically searched using the search terms BPD, adolescent, and psychotherapy from database inception to July 2019. Titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened by one reviewer; discrepancies were resolved via consensus. We extracted data on BPD symptomatology, including BPD symptoms, suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, general psychopathology, functional recovery, and treatment retention. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Results: Of 53 papers, seven trials (64 participants) were eligible. Psychotherapy led to significant short-term improvements in BPD symptomatology posttreatment ( g = −0.89 [−1.75, −0.02]) but not in follow-up ( g = 0.0 [−0.26, 0.39]). There was no significant difference in treatment retention between the experimental and control groups overall (odds ratio [ OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.12, I  = 52%).

To contribute to a convergent cognitive neuroscience of creativity, we conducted a pre-registered conceptual replication and extension study in which we assessed previously reported predictors of creativity using a multimodal approach, incorporating volumetric, white matter, and functional connectivity neuroimaging data. We assessed sets of pre-registered predictors against prevailing measures of creativity, including visual and verbal tests of divergent thinking, everyday creative behaviour, and creative achievement. We then conducted whole-brain exploratory analyses. Greater creativity was broadly predicted by features of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobe (IPL), including both local grey matter and white matter predictors in the IFG, the superior longitudinal fasciculus that connects them, and IFG-IPL functional connectivity. As IFG and IPL are important nodes within executive control and default mode networks (DMN), respectively, this result supports the view that executive modulation of DMN activity optimizes creative ideation. Furthermore, white matter integrity of the basal ganglia was also a generalizable creativity predictor, and exploratory analyses revealed the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and the parahippocampal gyrus to both be reliable predictors of creativity across neuroimaging modalities. This pattern aligns with proposals ascribing roles of working and long-term memory to problem-solving and imagination. Overall, our findings help to consolidate some, but not all, neural correlates of individual differences that have been discussed in the cognitive neuroimaging of creativity, yielding a subset that appear particularly promising for focused future investigation.",2020-02-01,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116292,116292,116292,206,,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981832395,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116292,journal-article,2981832395

While there are well-established principles for designing and evaluating programs of assessment, few studies illustrate and critically interpret, what a system of programmatic assessment looks like in practice. This study aims to use systems thinking and the 'two communities' metaphor to interpret a model of programmatic assessment and to identify challenges and opportunities with operationalization.An interpretive case study was used to investigate how programmatic assessment is being operationalized within one competency-based residency program at a Canadian university. Qualitative data were collected from residents, faculty, and program leadership via semi-structured group and individual interviews conducted at nine months post-CBME implementation. Data were analyzed using a combination of data-based inductive analysis and theory-derived deductive analysis.In this model, Academic Advisors had a central role in brokering assessment data between communities responsible for producing and using residents' performance information for decision making (i.e., formative, summative/evaluative, and program improvement). As system intermediaries, Academic Advisors were in a privileged position to see how the parts of the assessment system contributed to the functioning of the whole and could identify which system components were not functioning as intended. Challenges were identified with the documentation of residents' performance information (i.e., system inputs); use of low-stakes formative assessments to inform high-stakes evaluative judgments about the achievement of competence standards; and gaps in feedback mechanisms for closing learning loops.The findings of this research suggest that program stakeholders can benefit from a systems perspective regarding how their assessment practices contribute to the efficacy of the system as a whole.

Mycelial dosage, initial Pb 2+ concentration, solution pH and treatment time all were shown to have an influence on Pb 2+ removal. Granular, lead-containing precipitation was formed on the fungal hyphae upon exposure to lead nitrate, which was confirmed from scanning electron micrograph/Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM/EDS). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of lead (48.5% by weight) along with phosphorus in the precipitate. This extracellular precipitate was further identified as pyromorphite lead hydroxyphosphate [Pb 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH] by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. During Pb 2+ removal, size-enlarged mineral precipitation, and clustered nanospherical particles formed on the hyphae were revealed by SEM/XRD. A remarkable increase of mycelial phosphatase activity of 1. times that of the control and decreased phosphate concentration in solution (16.76 mg/L to 1.3 mg/L) initially upon exposure to Pb 2+ suggested that phosphatase may hydrolyze organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphate and release it into solution, participating in the biomineralization of Pb 2+ . Toxicity tests showed that the toxicity of Pb 2+ polluted water decreased after treatment.

Nanoindentation was conducted on ten grains at room temperature before and after ion irradiation (0.3 dpa, 250 °C). The hardness decreases as the declination angle (the angle between c-axis and sample surface normal) increases, both before and after irradiation. However, the irradiation induced maximum absolute and relative increment of hardness occur when the declination angle is about 55° and 60°, respectively. The hardness increment was found to be proportional to the relative activation of the type slip with increase of declination angle, at low angles. However for angles higher than 55–60° the hardness increment was found to be reduced by the activation of deformation twinning and cross slip. A peak increment of irradiation hardening is therefore observed due to the orientation-dependent combination of different deformation mechanisms. CRSS values of all slip systems and for {10–12} tension twinning before and after irradiation were obtained by fitting to a crystal plasticity finite element model (CPFEM).

It separates changed pixels from unchanged pixels by binarizing bi-temporal difference image. However, the results and performance are affected by the image acquisitions at different dates and the threshold decision rules for change magnitudes, resulting in serious false and missed detections. This paper proposed a novel tri-temporal logic-verified change vector analysis (TLCVA) approach which can identify the errors of CVA through logical reasoning and judgement with an additional temporal image assistance. This approach can not only achieve a reliable modification to the original change detection results, but also produce two additional improved change detection results in the logical circulation of land surface change automatically. The proposed method consists of three parts: traditional CVA change detection, automated sample selection, and refined modification based on SVM posterior probability comparison in temporal space. It was experimented by land cover change detection from Sentinel-2 and Planet Labs images in three study areas located in Ma’anshan, Nanjing and Taizhou City. The results show that accuracies have significant improvements by the TLCVA approach, and omission and commission errors reduce obviously. The generalization, sensitivity and efficiency of the proposed approach were also analyzed in the experiments.

The oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model was created to improve understanding of hypoxia- and hypoglycemia-induced neuronal cell injury, and provide an in vitro surrogate to assess novel treatments for cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical neuroprotective regulator of energy homeostasis, metabolism and cell survival. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms by which AMPK achieves these beneficial effects in human SH-SY5Y neural cells exposed to OGD are still not well understood. Resveratrol is a potent activator of AMPK suggesting it may have therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective agent. Therefore, we hypothesized the AMPK activator resveratrol protects against OGD-mediated impairment of human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. The novelty of the experiment using a 3D gelatin scaffold cell culture assay, we have tested the potential of 3D systems to mimic the endogenous neuronal environment and have applied these systems to study the effect of OGD on neuronal cells with/without resveratrol. Here we show resveratrol reverses, via AMPK-dependent downregulation of caspase  and  activity, the OGD-mediated decreases in SH-SY5Y cell viability on a 3D gelatin scaffold. In addition, treatment with OGD decreases mRNA levels of AMPK and the neuroprotective genes (Bcl-2 and CREB); however, co-treatment with resveratrol significantly normalizes these effects. Importantly, resveratrol improves the expression of AMPK and p-AMPK in OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Resveratrol also significantly rescues SH-SY5Y cells from OGD-mediated mitochondrial deficiency (lower D-loop level, mitochondrial mass, maximal respiratory function, COX activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential). Resveratrol also rescues the transcript expression levels of PGC1α and mitochondrial genes (NRF-1 and Tfam) in OGD-treated SH-SY5Y cells. These findings extend our mechanistic understanding of the central role of AMPK in OGD-related neuronal impairment, and may serve as basis for implementing new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ischemic stroke.",2020-01-01,Brain Research,https://openalex.org/V96638545,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146492,146492,146492,1726,,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978857210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146492,journal-article,2978857210

Yet, whether taking vacations, going out to dinner, facing a health crisis, or setting up a household, much of consumers’ lives are spent journeying together. With families as our focal collective, we adopt a social practice theory lens and integrate prior consumer research related to collective practice dynamics (identity goal interplay, connectedness, and corporeality) to articulate what retailers should consider when designing collective journeys. Using this theoretical foundation, we build a conceptual framework that identifies three roles retailers play in collective journeys: central, mediated, and dispersed. We differentiate each role by the core value retailers provide to consumer practices as well as the collective dynamic challenges implicated. Our framework highlights the need for retailers to structure their offerings to match the dynamics of families’ collective journeys. To explore this matching process more fully, we introduce the idea of ‘fields of alignment’ as the social spaces where retailers and consumers actively negotiate, improvise, and experiment to align around common frames for action. We use the concept of fields of alignment to generate implications for retailers, propose guidelines for managerial action, and present avenues for future research.",2020-03-01,Journal of Retailing,https://openalex.org/V159120381,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2019.11.008,9,24,96,1,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996867703,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2019.11.008,journal-article,2996867703

Dissolution of stibnite in oxidizing conditions releases Sb in drainage water and Sb is incorporated into the mineral structures of several secondary minerals. The most abundant Sb host in Beaver Brook tailings is primary stibnite, which dissolves, releasing Sb(III) to the pore water which rapidly oxidizes to Sb(V). The maximum concentration of Sb in tailings pore water is 26.4 mg/L and only 0.9% is in the form of Sb(III). In all surface water, Sb concentration ranges from 0.01 to 26.1 mg/L (average 9.4 mg/L) and is mostly present in its Sb(V) form (98.9–99.2% of total Sb). The secondary minerals containing Sb formed in tailings impoundment include tripuhyite-like Sb–Fe oxides (FeSbO4) where Sb is an important part of their structure, with variable Fe/Sb ratios and Sb concentrations of up to 37.8% by weight (average of 21.7%). These are important Sb host phases in the top 30 cm of tailings. Iron oxides enriched in Sb, such as goethite (FeOOH), where Sb (average of 3.9% by weight) is adsorbed or incorporated in the structure are common but represent less than 1.3% of the total mass of Sb. The elevated Mg concentrations in tailing ponds and pore water promote the precipitation of brandholzite (Mg[Sb(OH)6]2·6H2O) (in association with gypsum) during dry periods, which is easily dissolved during rainy periods. Brandholzite dissolution may significantly contribute to the concentration of dissolved Sb, together with stibnite dissolution, whereas Sb–Fe oxides are stable in the neutral pH, oxidized surface environment. Arsenic (As) accompanies Sb in all media but its behavior differs from that of Sb. The source of As is arsenopyrite, which decomposes more slowly than stibnite. This may be due to the formation of oxidation rims on arsenopyrite grains composed of Fe, As, S, Sb, and Ca which slow the dissolution, whereas no rims are seen on stibnite. Also, despite similar As and Sb concentration in bulk tailings, the concentration of Sb in drainage water is higher than that of As. In pore water, As(III) is the dominant oxidation state of As suggesting that the oxidation of dissolved As is slower than that of Sb.",2020-04-01,Applied Geochemistry,https://openalex.org/V105929320,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104528,104528,104528,115,,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000768577,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104528,journal-article,3000768577

However, the proposal of the existence of a pre-pubertal form of bipolar disorder manifesting in early childhood created substantial debate. In this narrative review, the literature and contributing factors pertaining to the controversy surrounding the proposed pre-pubertal bipolar disorder subtype are discussed. The resolution of the debate and lessons learned are highlighted.In the mid 1990s US researchers proposed that chronic irritability and explosive temper in pre-pubertal children with pre-existing ADHD and/or other learning and developmental disorders might represent a variant of mania. A number of factors contributed to this proposal including severely ill children with no diagnostic home given changes in the ADHD DSM diagnostic criteria and over-reliance on symptoms and structured interviews rather than on a clinical assessment incorporating developmental history, social context and clinical course. Prospective studies of children at high familial risk did not support the proposed pre-pubertal bipolar phenotype; but rather provided convergent evidence that bipolar disorder onset in adolescence and early adulthood not uncommonly preceded by sleep and internalizing symptoms and most often debuting as depression in adolescence (after puberty). Epidemiological studies of population and hospital discharge data provided evidence that the pre-pubertal bipolar phenotype was largely a US driven phenomenon.Psychiatric diagnosis is particularly challenging given the current lack of objective biomarkers. However, validity and utility of clinical diagnoses can be strengthened if all available predictive information is used to formulate a diagnosis. As in other areas of medicine, critical information required to make a valid diagnosis includes developmental history, clinical course, family history and treatment response-weighed against the known trajectories of classical disorders. Moreover, given that psychiatric disorders are in evolution over childhood and adolescence and symptoms, in of themselves, are often non-specific, a thorough clinical assessment incorporating collateral history and psychosocial context is paramount. Such an approach might have avoided or at least brought a more timely resolution to the debate on pre-pubertal mania.",2020-04-20,International Journal of Bipolar Disorders,https://openalex.org/V2737877894,Springer Nature,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307651/,18,18,8,1,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016498524,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-020-00185-2,journal-article,3016498524

It is commonly undiagnosed until a child has repeatedly failed to learn to read in elementary school; this late diagnosis not only places the child at an academic disadvantage but also can be a precursor to psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Genetic and neuroimaging research have revealed that dyslexia is heritable and that it is undergirded by brain differences that are present even before reading instruction begins. Cognitive-behavioral research has revealed that there are early literacy skill deficits that represent red flags for dyslexia risk and can be measured at a preschool age. Altogether, this evidence points to dyslexia as a disorder that can be flagged by a pediatrician before school entry, during a period of heightened brain plasticity when interventions are more likely to be effective. In this review, we discuss the clinical implications of the most recent advances in dyslexia research, which converge to indicate that early identification and screening are crucial to the prevention or mitigation of adverse secondary consequences of dyslexia. We further highlight evidence-based and practical strategies for the implementation of early risk identification in pediatric practice so that physicians can be empowered in their ability to treat, educate, and advocate for their patients and families with dyslexia.",2020-06-01,Pediatrics,https://openalex.org/V77494981,American Academy of Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-3046,,,146,1,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036630428,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-3046,journal-article,3036630428

Support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are popular choices for classifiers. These supervised classifiers perform well when developed for specific applications and trained with known class images. Their drawback is that they cannot be easily applied to different applications without extensive retuning. Moreover, for the same application, they do not perform well if there are unknown class images. This paper proposes a novel solution to the above limitations of SVMs and ANNs, with the development of a hybrid approach that combines supervised and semi-supervised layers. To illustrate its performance, the system is applied to three different small part identification and sorting applications: (1) solid plastic gears, (2) clear plastic wire connectors and (3) metallic Indian coins. The ability of the system to work with different applications with minimal tuning and user inputs illustrates its flexibility. The robustness of the system is demonstrated by its ability to reject unknown class images. Four hybrid classification methods were developed and tested: (1) SSVM–USVM, (2) USVM–SSVM, (3) USVM–SANN and (4) SANN–USVM. It was found that SANN–USVM gave the best results with an accuracy of over 95% for all three applications. A software package known as FlexMVS for flexible machine vision system was written to illustrate the hybrid approach that enabled easy execution of the image conditioning, feature extraction and classification steps.

Materials and Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses) guidelines. We searched for English-language, peer-reviewed studies across  databases using a combination of Medical Subject Headings and keywords. We summarized the quantitative and qualitative results of included studies and rated studies according to the Best Evidence in Medical Education system. Results Our search yielded 61 citations, of which 1 studies were included. Seven studies involved medical students,  studies involved residents, and  study involved both groups. All interventions used a practical component involving entering information into a simulated or prototypical EHR. None of the interventions involved extracting, aggregating, or visualizing clinical data for panels of patients or specific populations. Discussion This review reveals few high-quality initiatives focused on training learners to engage with EHRs for both individual patient care and population health improvement. In comparing these interventions with the broad set of electronic records competencies expected of matriculating physicians, critical gaps in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education remain.

A meta-analytic test of the Optimal Endocrine Phenotype Hypothesis,"Endocrine traits (e.g., circulating hormone concentrations, receptor expression) can vary considerably among individuals within populations. Here, we develop two evolutionary hypotheses to explain this variation. Under the Optimal Endocrine Phenotype Hypothesis, adaptive plastic responses to environmental variation generate individual variation in endocrine traits and allow individuals to express near-optimal endocrine phenotypes. In contrast, under the Ongoing Selection Hypothesis, individual variation in endocrine traits reflects varying adaptive value, with some individuals expressing suboptimal phenotypes that are selected against. These two hypotheses generate distinct predictions for the effects of hormone manipulations on fitness. Under the Optimal Endocrine Phenotype Hypothesis, all hormone manipulations should incur fitness costs, whereas under the Ongoing Selection Hypothesis, manipulating endocrine phenotypes toward a putative optimum should increase fitness. Using a meta-analysis of findings from experimental field studies that involved manipulation of circulating glucocorticoids or androgens and measurement of fitness effects, we test and find some support for the Optimal Endocrine Phenotype Hypothesis. On average, fitness was reduced across 97 estimates of the effects of experimental hormone manipulations on fitness. However, the fitness effects of glucocorticoid manipulations varied with the sex of the individuals being studied. Fitness was more uniformly reduced by glucocorticoid manipulations in males and when both sexes were considered together. In females, effects on fitness varied from highly positive to highly negative. The effects of androgen manipulations varied across males and females, and depending upon whether fitness was estimated using measures of reproductive success or survival. Reproductive success was consistently decreased by androgen manipulation in females, but was increased almost as often as it was decreased across experiments in males. When survival was estimated as a component of fitness, it was fairly uniformly compromised by exogenous androgens in males. This variation in fitness effects of hormone manipulations across sexes and fitness metrics is consistent with the expectation that hormones differentially regulate life-history investment and that optimal endocrine phenotypes differ between males and females. Overall, our meta-analysis provides some support for the Optimal Endocrine Phenotype Hypothesis, but we await direct tests of the Ongoing Selection Hypothesis to determine the degree to which individual variation in endocrine traits continues to be shaped by natural selection.",2020-01-15,Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V191044671,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.110640,110640,110640,500,,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985855155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.110640,journal-article,2985855155

The relationship between exercise duration and EPOC magnitude is thought to be linear whereas the relationship between EPOC magnitude and exercise intensity is thought to be exponential. Accordingly, near-maximal and supramaximal protocols such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) protocols have been hypothesized to produce greater EPOC magnitudes than submaximal moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). This review updates previous reviews by focusing on the impact of HIIT and SIT on EPOC. Research to date suggests small differences in EPOC post-HIIT compared to MICT in the immediate (<1 hour) recovery period, but greater EPOC values post-HIIT when examined over 24 hours. Conversely, differences in EPOC post-SIT are more pronounced, as SIT tends to produce a larger EPOC vs MICT at all time points. We discuss potential mechanisms that may drive the EPOC response to interval training (eg, glycogen resynthesis, mitochondrial uncoupling, and protein turnover among others) and also consider the role of EPOC as one of the potential contributors to fat loss following HIIT/SIT interventions. Lastly, we highlight a number of methodological shortcomings related to the measurement of EPOC following HIIT and SIT.",2020-04-01,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports,https://openalex.org/V199863227,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13610,638,651,30,4,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996069031,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13610,journal-article,2996069031

As this work has evolved, researchers have sought to differentiate among key measures, often arguing that each represents a different type of social capital. Despite the importance of this work, few studies have examined (a) whether these measures are in fact distinct constructs, particularly over time, (b) if these relationships are causal, and (c) whether gender patterns the ways these measures are related. Using a probability-based sample of adults with 1-3 observations per respondent, we apply generalized structural equation modeling to assess in women and men separately whether generalized trust, trust in neighbors, network diversity, social isolation, and social participation are associated with each other, hypertension, and self-reported health over a five-year period. The initial response rate was 38.7%, with cooperation rates of 60.4% and 56.3% at waves two and three. Findings highlight stability in the longitudinal relationship of the same measure across waves. They also suggest that social capital measures operate differently for men and women, with key measures of one type of social capital more often associated with another type in women than men. Nevertheless, the strengths of the associations remain weak in women and men, particularly over time, suggesting that these measures (especially generalized trust) may be inadequate proxies for each other. Lastly, social capital seemed more salient for women's than men's health. Future research on social capital might consider more deeply the role and meaning of gender in interpreting the results of studies linking social capital to health. Further consideration of trust, participation, and network capital as distinct constructs is also warranted.",2020-07-01,Social Science & Medicine,https://openalex.org/V106822843,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.02.023,112172,112172,257,,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2915299234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.02.023,journal-article,2915299234

Since the discovery of the first non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the 1980s, the field has gone on to recognize ncRNAs as important molecular regulators of RNA activity and protein function, knowledge of which has stimulated the expansion of a scientific field that quests to understand the role of ncRNAs in cellular physiology, tissue homeostasis, and human disease. Although our knowledge of these molecules has significantly improved over the years, we have limited understanding of their precise functions, protein interacting partners, and tissue-specific activities. Adding to this complexity, it remains unknown exactly how many ncRNAs there are in existence. The increased use of high-throughput transcriptomics techniques has rapidly expanded the list of ncRNAs, which now includes classical ncRNAs (e.g., ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs), microRNAs, and long ncRNAs. In addition, splicing by-products of protein-coding genes and ncRNAs, so-called circular RNAs, are now being investigated.

While intrinsic movement has been hypothesized as the major determinant of population genetic structuring in abundant vagile species, growing evidence indicates that vagility does not always predict genetic differentiation. However, identifying the determinants of genetic structuring can be challenging, and these are largely unknown for most vagile species. Although, in principle, levels of gene flow can be inferred from neutral allele frequency divergence among populations, underlying assumptions may be unrealistic. Moreover, molecular studies have suggested that contemporary gene flow has often not overridden historical influences on population genetic structure, which indicates potential inadequacies of any interpretations that fail to consider the influence of history in shaping that structure. This exhaustive review of the theoretical and empirical literature investigates the determinants of population genetic differentiation using seabirds as a model system for vagile taxa. Seabirds provide a tractable group within which to identify the determinants of genetic differentiation, given their widespread distribution in marine habitats and an abundance of ecological and genetic studies conducted on this group. Herein we evaluate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in 73 seabird species. Lack of mutation–drift equilibrium observed in 19% of species coincided with lower estimates of genetic differentiation, suggesting that dynamic demographic histories can often lead to erroneous interpretations of contemporary gene flow, even in vagile species. Presence of land across the species sampling range, or sampling of breeding colonies representing ice‐free Pleistocene refuge zones, appear to be associated with genetic differentiation in Tropical and Southern Temperate species, respectively, indicating that long‐term barriers and persistence of populations are important for their genetic structuring. Conversely, biotic factors commonly considered to influence population genetic structure, such as spatial segregation during foraging, were inconsistently associated with population genetic differentiation. In light of these results, we recommend that genetic studies should consider potential historical events when identifying determinants of genetic differentiation among populations to avoid overestimating the role of contemporary factors, even for highly vagile taxa",2020-02-05,Biological Reviews,https://openalex.org/V86137544,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12580,625,651,95,3,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005262955,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12580,journal-article,3005262955

Studies to date have yet to employ quantitative methods (qPTEN) for measuring of prognostically relevant amounts of PTEN loss in postsurgical settings and demonstrate its clinical application. Methods PTEN protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry in radical prostatectomy samples from training (n = 410) and validation (n = 272) cohorts. PTEN loss was quantified per cancer cell and per tissue microarray core. Thresholds for identifying clinically relevant PTEN loss were determined using log-rank statistics in the training cohort. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards) analyses on various subpopulations were performed to assess biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and were independently validated. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results PTEN loss in more than 65% cancer cells was most clinically relevant and had statistically significant association with reduced BRFS in training (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.87; P &amp;lt; .001) and validation cohorts (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.0 to 8.83; P &amp;lt; .001).

Adolescents' daily lives and their engagement in risks have changed dramatically in the course of the 21st century, leading to a need to update traditional models of risk to include new exposures and behaviors. To date, studies have examined the relationship between (mainly traditional) risk behaviors and adolescent mental well-being or looked at risk factors that jeopardize mental well-being such as lack of social support but have not combined them together to highlight the most significant risks for adolescent mental well-being today. The present study included new and traditional risk behaviors and risk factors, robustly derived an empirically based model of clusters of risk, and examined the relative association of these clusters to adolescent mental well-being. Methods Data from the 2017–2018 Health Behaviours in School-aged Children study were used. The sample included 32,884 adolescents (51.7% girls) aged 1 years from 3 countries and regions. The principal component analysis was used to determine the existence of clusters of risk, using 2 items related to adolescent mental well-being that included both risk behaviors (e.g., substance use) and risk factors (e.g., peer support). Analysis was conducted in both a randomly split training and test set and in gender separate models. Mixed-effects logistic regressions examined the association between clusters of risk and mental well-being indices (low life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints). Results Seven clusters of risk were identified: substance use and early sex, low social support, insufficient nutrition, bullying, sugary foods and drinks, physical health risk, and problematic social media use (SMU). Low social support and SMU were the strongest predictors of low life satisfaction (odds ratios = 2.167 and 1.330, respectively) and psychosomatic complaints (odds ratio = 1.687 and 1.386, respectively). Few gender differences in predictors were found. Exposure to bullying was somewhat more associated with psychosomatic complaints for girls, whereas physical health risk was associated with reduced relative odds of low life satisfaction among boys. Split-sample validation and out-of-sample prediction confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusions The results highlight the importance of contemporary clusters of risk, such as low social support and SMU in the mental well-being of young people and the need to focus on these as targets for prevention. We propose that future studies should use composite risk measures that take into account both risk behaviors and risk factors to explain adolescents' mental well-being.",2020-06-01,Journal of Adolescent Health,https://openalex.org/V101177023,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.02.012,S40,S49,66,6,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3027873794,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.02.012,journal-article,3027873794

Patient and family engagement in Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the primary care setting could improve the concordance between patients’ wishes and the healthcare received when patients cannot speak for themselves. The aim of this study was to better understand the barriers faced by older patients regarding talking to their family members and family physicians about ACP. Methods In this multi-site cross-sectional study, three free text questions regarding reasons patients found it difficult to discuss ACP with their families or their family physicians were part of a self-administered questionnaire about patients’ knowledge of and engagement in ACP. The questionnaire, which included closed ended questions followed by three probing open ended questions, was distributed in 2 family practices across  provinces in Canada. The free text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and form the basis of this paper. Results One hundred two participants provided an analyzable response to the survey when asked why they haven’t talked to someone about ACP. Two hundred fifty-four answered the question about talking to their physician and 34 answered the question about talking to family members. Eight distinct themes emerged from the free text response analysis: 1. They were too young for ACP; 2. The topic is too emotional; 3. The Medical Doctor (MD) should be responsible for bringing up ACP 4. A fear of negatively impacting the patient-physician relationship; 5. Not enough time in appointments; 6. Concern about family dynamics; 7. It’s not a priority; and 8. A lack of knowledge about ACP. Conclusions Patients in our sample described many barriers to ACP discussions, including concerns about the effect these discussions may have on relationships with both family members and family physicians, and issues relating to patients’ knowledge and interpretation of the importance, responsibility for, or relevance of ACP itself. Family physicians may be uniquely placed to leverage the longitudinal, person- centred relationship they have with patients to mitigate some of these barriers.",2020-05-25,BMC Family Practice,https://openalex.org/V153257185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,,,21,1,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031024004,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,journal-article,3031024004

Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are recognized indicators of fecal contamination in water. Comparative genomics of enterococci isolated from conventional activated sludge (CAS) and biological aerated filter (BAF) WWTPs was conducted. Results VRE isolates, including E. faecalis ( n = 24), E. faecium ( n = 11), E. casseliflavus (n = 2) and E. gallinarum (n = 2) were selected for sequencing based on WWTP source, species and AMR phenotype. The pangenomes of E. faecium and E. faecalis were both open. The genomic fraction related to the mobilome was positively correlated with genome size in E. faecium ( p &lt; 0.001) and E. faecalis ( p &lt; 0.001) and with the number of AMR genes in E. faecium ( p = 0.005). Genes conferring vancomycin resistance, including van A and van M ( E. faecium ), van G ( E. faecalis ), and van C ( E. casseliflavus / E. gallinarum ), were detected in 2 genomes. The most prominent functional AMR genes were efflux pumps and transporters. A minimum of 16, 6,  and  virulence genes were detected in E. faecium , E. faecalis , E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum, respectively. Virulence genes were more common in E. faecalis and E. faecium , than E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum . A number of mobile genetic elements were shared among species. Functional CRISPR/Cas arrays were detected in 1 E. faecalis genomes, with all but one also containing a prophage. The lack of a functional CRISPR/Cas arrays was associated with multi-drug resistance in E. faecium . Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated differential clustering of isolates based on original source but not WWTP. Genes related to phage and CRISPR/Cas arrays could potentially serve as environmental biomarkers.

Our group has previously shown that tau ablation triggers glucose intolerance and pancreatic dysfunction in mice, suggesting that tau plays a role in peripheral metabolic regulation. Little is known about the role of tau in anxiety. Moreover, inconsistent results have been generated regarding the effects of tau deletion in memory. Here, we characterize systemic insulin resistance, anxiety-related behavior and memory in 1 to 2 weeks old Wild-Type (WT), Tau knockout (TauKO) and a distinct hTau mouse model consisting of tau knockout expressing the longest isoform (2N4R) of a non-mutant WT human Tau protein under the prion promoter (hTau). Our findings demonstrate that tau deletion leads to anxiety-related behavior, impaired contextual and cued fear memory. The presence of a human Tau transgene did not ameliorate the phenotypes observed in animals lacking the mouse tau protein and it elicited impairments in learning, memory, and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest that tau protein plays a role in memory and anxiety-related behavior. Our findings also indicate that previously unrecognized functions for tau protein may be a complicating factor in using animal models on the TauKO background. Understanding the link between tau pathophysiology and cognitive and metabolic alterations is of great importance to establish the complete contribution of tau protein to AD pathogenesis.",2020-03-12,Frontiers in Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V2597401208,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00124,,,11,,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011438444,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00124,journal-article,3011438444

Training periods were separated by a three-month washout period.VO2max and TTF were assessed via incremental tests with supramaximal verification before and after each training period. Pearson correlation coefficients (r), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and within-subjects coefficients of variation (CV) were used to assess reproducibility of observed VO2max and TTF responses.VO2max and TTF values before the second training period were not significantly higher than baseline values and there were no significant (p>0.05) interaction effects (period 1: VO2max: +4.04±2.29mL/kg/min, TTF: +70.75±35.87s; period 2: VO2max: +2.83±2.74mL/kg/min, TTF: +83.46±34.55s).

With crowdsourced bus service, the users with similar trips can enjoy the customized bus route efficiently and inexpensively. However, serious privacy concerns (e.g., the exposure of users’ current and future locations) have become a major barrier. To protect users’ itineraries, we propose Privbus, a privacy-enhanced crowdsourced bus service without hampering the functionality of bus route planning. Specifically, Privbus improves the performance of clustering itineraries due to the assistance of fogs. Then, Privbus executes the fog-assisted density peaks clustering operations on ciphertexts of users’ travel plans to protect the users’ trips. By doing so, the clustering operation is removed from users’ smart devices to fog nodes, so as to enable the users to be offline after they submit their travel plans. According to the clustering results, Privbus uses a route planning method to optimize the bus routes. The optimization reduces the time cost on travel of users, while guaranteeing the good profit and the wide coverage of crowdsourced bus service. Finally, through the performance evaluation and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Privbus has the advantage of low computational and communication overhead, while providing high security and precision guarantees.",2020-01-01,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,https://openalex.org/V157146593,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.09.007,156,168,135,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2976887390,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.09.007,journal-article,2976887390

In addition, a class of enzymes coined as oligopeptidases are able to cleave several of these neuropeptides, and their potential implication in SCZ was also demonstrated. Interestingly, these enzymes are able to play roles as modulators of neuropeptidergic systems, and they were also implicated in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, neuron migration, and therefore, in neurodevelopment and brain formation. Altered activity of oligopeptidases in SCZ was described only more recently, suggesting their possible utility as biomarkers for mental disorders diagnosis or treatment response.

Recent research suggests water insecurity is associated with negative mental health outcomes. Despite global improvement in access to safe water across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that access to safe water in urban areas has not changed significantly or has stagnated in certain countries. In most African cities, entrepreneurial water vendors have stepped up to fill supply gaps in the formal delivery system by selling vended water. As part of a larger research program that aims to assess and analyze public perceptions around vended water, this paper explores the links connecting water insecurity and emotional distress among urban slum dwellers who mostly use vended water in Accra, Ghana. We used a parallel mixed-methods approach. Our quantitative results show that water-insecure households (OR = 2.23, p = 0.01) were more likely to report emotional distresses compared to water-secure households. However, households with improved sanitation (OR = 0.28, p = 0.01) and those willing to participate for improved water and sanitation (OR = 0.28, p = 0.01) were less likely to report emotional distress. Our qualitative results offered support for the quantitative results, as participants not only hold various perceptions regarding the safety and quality of vended water but expressed emotional distresses such as fear of contamination, discomfort, worry over arbitrary change in prices, and anxiety.

However, there is little research on the integration of PROs in “real-world” oncology practices using implementation science methods. The Improving Patient Experience and Health Outcome Collaborative (iPEHOC) intervention was established at multisite disease clinics to facilitate the use of PRO data by clinicians for precision symptom care. The aim of this study was to examine if patients exposed to the intervention differed in their healthcare utilization compared with contemporaneous controls in the same time frame. We used a PRE- and DURING-intervention population cohort comparison study design to estimate the effects of the iPEHOC intervention on the difference in difference (DID) for relative rates (RR) for emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, psychosocial oncology (PSO), palliative care visits, and prescription rates for opioids and antidepressants compared with controls. A small significantly lower Difference in Difference (DID) (− 0.223) in the RR for ED visits was noted for the intervention compared with controls over time (0.947, CI 0.900–0.996); and a DID (− 0.0329) for patients meeting ESAS symptom thresholds (0.927, CI 0.869–0.990).

Using 43 years (1975−2017) of data from a box-nesting population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we identified reduced survival of offspring as a probable demographic cause of population decline. Poor fledging success was associated with increased predation and poor weather conditions during early nestling development. Low juvenile survival and subsequent recruitment was linked to poor weather conditions during the post-fledging period and may also be linked to conditions on the wintering grounds. Regional weather conditions during critical stages of breeding (early nestling and post-fledging) have become progressively worse over the 43-year study period. None of the other factors linked to offspring survival have similarly deteriorated.

The global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as global positioning system (GPS) are the primary sources of navigation information for such purpose. However, high-rise buildings in urban canyons block the GPS satellites signals. Alternatively, inertial navigation system (INS) is typically working as a backup. A reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) is used instead of the full INS to achieve the same purpose in land vehicles navigation with fewer sensors and computations. Unfortunately, the RISS solution drifts over time, but this can be mitigated when integrated with the GPS. However, the integration solution drifts in the case of GPS signal loss (outages). Therefore, the position errors grow especially during extended periods of GPS outages. Azimuth/heading angle is critical to keep the vehicle on the route. In this paper, an azimuth update estimated from a calibrated magnetometer is introduced to improve the accuracy of the overall system. A new approach is proposed for pre-processing the magnetometer data utilizing a discrete-cosine-transform (DCT)-based pre-filtering stage. The obtained azimuth is utilized in updating the RISS system during the whole trajectory and mainly during GPS outage periods. The proposed approach significantly decreases both the azimuth error and the position error growth rate when driving in urban canyons where the GPS signals are blocked. Finally, the proposed system was tested on a real road trajectory data for a metropolitan area. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the whole system improved, especially during the GPS outage periods.",2020-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,https://openalex.org/V144771191,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2905871,1250,1263,21,3,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2945760909,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2905871,journal-article,2945760909

Despite the efforts of their designers, APIs may suffer from a number of issues (such as incomplete or erroneous documentation, poor performance, and backward incompatibility). To maintain a healthy client base, API designers must learn these issues to fix them. Question answering sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), have become a popular place for discussing API issues. These posts about API issues are invaluable to API designers, not only because they can help to learn more about the problem but also because they can facilitate learning the requirements of API users. However, the unstructured nature of posts and the abundance of non-issue posts make the task of detecting SO posts concerning API issues difficult and challenging. In this paper, we first develop a supervised learning approach using a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a statistical modeling method, to identify API issue-related sentences. We use the above information together with different features collected from posts, the experience of users, readability metrics and centrality measures of collaboration network to build a technique, called CAPS, that can classify SO posts concerning API issues. In total, we consider 34 features along eight different dimensions. Evaluation of CAPS using carefully curated SO posts on three popular API types reveals that the technique outperforms all three baseline approaches we consider in this study.

Stack Overflow is the most prominent of such websites. With the rapidly increasing number of questions on Stack Overflow, it is becoming difficult to get an answer to all questions and as a result, millions of questions on Stack Overflow remain unsolved. In an attempt to improve the visibility of unsolved questions, Stack Overflow introduced a bounty system to motivate users to solve such questions. In this bounty system, users can offer reputation points in an effort to encourage users to answer their question. In this paper, we study 129,202 bounty questions that were proposed by 61,824 bounty backers. We observe that bounty questions have a higher solving-likelihood than non-bounty questions. This is particularly true for long-standing unsolved questions. For example, questions that were unsolved for 100 days for which a bounty is proposed are more likely to be solved (55%) than those without bounties (1.7%). In addition, we studied the factors that are important for the solving-likelihood and solving-time of a bounty question. We found that: (1) Questions are likely to attract more traffic after receiving a bounty than non-bounty questions. (2) Bounties work particularly well in very large communities with a relatively low question solving-likelihood. (3) High-valued bounties are associated with a higher solving-likelihood, but we did not observe a likelihood for expedited solutions. Our study shows that while bounties are not a silver bullet for getting a question solved, they are associated with a higher solving-likelihood of a question in most cases. As questions that are still unsolved after two days hardly receive any traffic, we recommend that Stack Overflow users propose a bounty as soon as possible after those two days for the bounty to have the highest impact.",2020-01-01,Empirical Software Engineering,https://openalex.org/V109852484,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-019-09744-3,139,177,25,1,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2966112319,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-019-09744-3,journal-article,2966112319

Animal studies have demonstrated the involvement of constituents, along with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, in neural development and rare genetic disorders (e.g., colony stimulating factor 1 receptor [CSF1R] deficiency). Genome wide association studies suggest a comparable role of the system in humans. Although the CNS can be the target of primary autoimmune disorders, no current experimental model captures all of the features of the most common human disorder placed in this category, multiple sclerosis (MS). Such features include spontaneous onset, environmental contributions, and a recurrent/progressive disease course in a genetically predisposed host. Numerous therapeutic interventions related to antigen and cytokine specific therapies have demonstrated effectiveness in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model used to define principles underlying immune-mediated mechanisms in MS. Despite the similarities in the two diseases, most treatments used to ameliorate EAE have failed to translate to the human disease. As directly demonstrated in animal models and implicated by correlative studies in humans, adaptive and innate constituents within the systemic compartment and resident in the CNS contribute to the disease course of neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral disorders.

Therefore, conducting genetic studies of patients at the most severe end of the depressive disorder spectrum, those with treatment-resistant depression and who are prescribed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), could lead to a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of depression. Despite ECT being one of the most effective forms of treatment for severe depressive disorders, it is usually placed at the end of treatment algorithms of current guidelines. This is perhaps because ECT has controlled risk and logistical demands including use of general anaesthesia and muscle relaxants and side-effects such as short-term memory impairment. Better understanding of the genetics and biology of ECT response and of cognitive side-effects could lead to more personalized treatment decisions. To enhance the understanding of the genomics of severe depression and ECT response, researchers and ECT providers from around the world and from various depression or ECT networks, but not limited to, such as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, the Clinical Alliance and Research in ECT, and the National Network of Depression Centers have formed the Genetics of ECT International Consortium (Gen-ECT-ic). Gen-ECT-ic will organize the largest clinical and genetic collection to date to study the genomics of severe depressive disorders and response to ECT, aiming for 30,000 patients worldwide using a GWAS approach.

The objective of the current research was to design and validate the Defending Behaviors Scale (DBS), a multidimensional self-report scale of defending behaviors. Data were collected from 57 early adolescents in Grades  to 8. Participants completed the DBS as well as established measures of bullying, victimization, empathy, aggression, social self-efficacy, social support, and prosocial behavior. Data were analyzed using an exploratory structural equation modeling framework. A four-factor model provided the best fit to the data. Direct defending included aggressive and solution-focused behaviors, whereas indirect defending included comforting and reporting to authority. Girls were more likely to defend others by offering comfort and reporting to authority, whereas aggressive defending was more common among boys. Each subscale demonstrated good internal consistency (α's 0.80-0.92) and was uniquely associated with empathy, aggression, and other types of prosocial behavior.

Up to 90% of individuals with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). However, the limitations of current treatments for NPS have drivent he search for safer pharmacotherapies—including cannabinoids. Aim: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of cannabinoids for the treatment of NPS in individuals with dementia. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. Setting and participants: Of 6,902 papers,  were eligible ( n = 205, 44% female, 7 ±  years, 85% Alzheimer disease). Trials were in North America and Europe and explored tetrahydrocannabinol ( n = 3), dronabinol ( n = 5), or nabilone ( n = 1). Measurement: Titles/abstracts were independently screened by one reviewer and reviewed by a second. Full-text screening was by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on the standardized mean difference (SMD) for several NPS instruments, trial completion, and adverse events. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Findings: Cannabinoids led to significant improvements across NPS instruments, including the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (SMD = −0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.4 to −0.16), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD = −0.61; CI, −1.0 to −0.15), and nocturnal actigraphy (SMD = −1.05; CI, −1.5 to −0.54h). Cannabinoids were well-tolerated, with an overall trial completion rate of 93% (193/205) and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Treatment efficacy was associated with baseline dementia severity and dose, but not dementia subtype, age, or sex. The overall study quality was rated as low.

The current study analyzes the initial experience of the InterSurgeon website in partnering surgeons from across the world to increase surgical collaboration. METHODS One year after the launch of the InterSurgeon website, data were collected to quantify the number of website visits, average session duration, total numbers of matches, and number of offers and requests added to the website each month. Additionally, a 15-question survey was designed and distributed to all registered members of the website. RESULTS There are currently 32 surgeon and institutional members of InterSurgeon representing 6 different countries and all global regions. At the time of the survey there were 27 members, of whom 7 responded to the survey, yielding a response rate of 27.4% (76/277). Twenty-five participants (32.9%) confirmed having either received a match email (12/76, 15.8%) or initiated contact with another user via the website (13/76, 17.1%). As expected, the majority of the collaborations were either between a high-income country (HIC) and a low-income country (LIC) (5/18, 27.8%) or between an HIC and a middle-income country (MIC) (9/18, 50%). Interestingly, there were  MIC-to-MIC collaborations (2/18, 11.1%) as well as 1 MIC-to-LIC (1/18, 5.6%) and 1 LIC-to-LIC partnership. At the time of response,  (33.3%) of the matches had at least resulted in initial contact via email or telephone. One of the partnerships had involved face-to-face interaction via video conference. A total of  respondents had traveled internationally to visit their partner’s institution. CONCLUSIONS Within its first year of launch, the InterSurgeon membership has grown significantly. The partnerships that have already been formed involve not only international visits between HICs and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), but also telecollaboration and inter-LMIC connections that allow for greater exchange of knowledge and expertise.

In streptomycetes, c-di-GMP plays a crucial role in a complex morphological differentiation by modulating an activity of the pleiotropic regulator BldD. Here we report that c-di-GMP plays a key role in regulating secondary metabolite production in streptomycetes by altering the expression levels of bldD. Deletion of cdgB encoding a diguanylate cyclase in Streptomycesghanaensis reduced c-di-GMP levels and the production of the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase inhibitor moenomycin A. In contrast to the cdgB mutant, inactivation of rmdB, encoding a phosphodiesterase for the c-di-GMP hydrolysis, positively correlated with the c-di-GMP and moenomycin A accumulation. Deletion of bldD adversely affected the synthesis of secondary metabolites in S. ghanaensis, including the production of moenomycin A. The bldD-deficient phenotype is partly mediated by an increase in expression of the pleiotropic regulatory gene wblA. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrate that a complex of c-di-GMP and BldD effectively represses transcription of wblA, thus preventing sporogenesis and sustaining antibiotic synthesis. These results show that manipulation of the expression of genes controlling c-di-GMP pool has the potential to improve antibiotic production as well as activate the expression of silent gene clusters.",2020-02-20,Nucleic Acids Research,https://openalex.org/V134668137,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1220,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003078574,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1220,journal-article,3003078574

Individuals with FoG ('freezers') may require functional reorganization of spinal mechanisms to perform APAs due to supraspinal dysfunction. As presynaptic inhibition (PSI) is centrally modulated to allow execution of supraspinal motor commands, it may be deficient in freezers during APAs. We show that freezers presented PSI in quiet stance (control task), but they presented loss of PSI (i.e. higher ratio of the conditioned H-reflex relative to the test H-reflex) during APAs before step initiation (functional task), whereas non-freezers and healthy control individuals presented PSI in both the tasks. The loss of PSI in freezers was associated with both small APA amplitudes and FoG severity. We hypothesize that loss of PSI during APAs for step initiation in freezers may be due to FoG.Freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson's disease involves deficient anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), resulting in a cessation of step initiation due to supraspinal dysfunction. Individuals with FoG ('freezers') may require functional reorganization of spinal mechanisms to perform APAs. As presynaptic inhibition (PSI) is centrally modulated to allow execution of supraspinal motor commands, here we hypothesized a loss of PSI in freezers during APA for step initiation, which would be associated with FoG severity. Seventy individuals [27 freezers, 2 non-freezers, and 2 age-matched healthy controls (HC)] performed a 'GO'-commanded step initiation task on a force platform under three conditions: (1) without electrical stimulation, (2) test Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) and (3) conditioned H-reflex. They also performed a control task (quiet stance). In the step initiation task, the H-reflexes were evoked on the soleus muscle when the amplitude of the APA exceeded 10-20% of the mean baseline mediolateral force. PSI was quantified by the ratio of the conditioned H-reflex relative to the test H-reflex in both the tasks. Objective assessment of FoG severity (FoG-ratio) was performed. Freezers presented lower PSI levels during quiet stance than non-freezers and HC (P < 0.05).

We consider both Nash (simultaneous-move) and Stackelberg (leader–follower) equilibria of dynamic signaling games under quadratic criteria. For the multi-stage scalar cheap talk, we show that the final stage equilibrium is always quantized and under further conditions the equilibria for all time stages must be quantized. In contrast, the Stackelberg equilibria are always fully revealing. In the multi-stage signaling game where the transmission of a Gauss–Markov source over a memoryless Gaussian channel is considered, affine policies constitute an invariant subspace under best response maps for Nash equilibria; whereas the Stackelberg equilibria always admit linear policies for scalar sources but such policies may be non-linear for multi-dimensional sources. We obtain an explicit recursion for optimal linear encoding policies for multi-dimensional sources, and derive conditions under which Stackelberg equilibria are informative.",2020-05-01,Automatica,https://openalex.org/V51360982,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2020.108883,108883,108883,115,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008936904,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2020.108883,journal-article,3008936904

Design Interpretive description qualitative study. Setting Participants were recruited from primary care sites and a hospital-based chronic pain clinic in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Subjects Adults (&amp;gt;18 years of age) who self-identified as experiencing chronic pain (three months’ duration) were interviewed. Methods In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with participants. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed for accuracy by the interviewer. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Peer debriefing, reflexivity, and multiple in-person meetings were used to establish trustworthiness. Results Sixteen adults (five men, 1 women) with a median age of 5 years were interviewed. Strategies used by people living with chronic pain to participate in physical activity and exercise included 1) finding the motivation, 2) setting up for success, 3) leveraging social support, and 4) managing pain and discomfort during activity. Recommendations for health care providers when promoting participation in physical activity and exercise for people living with chronic pain included 1) the importance of listening, 2) providing tailored advice, 3) being supportive, and 4) making physical activity and exercise programming accessible. Conclusions People living with chronic pain reported using multiple strategies to participate in physical activity and exercise.

However, aberrant activation of RET, through oncogenic mutations or overexpression, can contribute to tumourigenesis, regional invasion, and metastasis of several human cancers. RET is expressed as two main isoforms with unique C-terminal sequences that differ in protein interactions and subcellular trafficking in response to RET activation, and which also have distinct oncogenic potentials. The long isoform, termed RET51, is internalized from the membrane in response to stimulation by its ligand, GDNF, but is known to recycle back to the surface via RAB11 endosomes. However, the mechanisms regulating this process and its cellular effects have not been defined. Here, we show that recycling of RET51 requires a multicomponent complex that includes the endosomal-sorting protein GGA3, which mediates GDNF-dependent slow recycling of RET51 receptors to the plasma membrane. Our data show that the GRB2 adapter associates with RET51 through interactions with its C-terminal sequences, facilitating recruitment of active ARF6 and GGA3 interaction, and that depletion of GGA3 or ARF6 reduced RET51 recycling. Further, GGA3 knockdown accelerated RET5 degradation and also attenuated RET-mediated AKT activation. Finally, we showed that recycling of RET5 to the cell surface through association with GGA3 and ARF6 contributes to RET51-dependent cell motility, migration, and invasion. Our data establish RET recycling as a mechanism coordinating location and duration of RET signals in order to direct cell movement and invasion.",2020-02-01,Oncogene,https://openalex.org/V128439998,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-019-1068-z,1361,1377,39,6,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982198004,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-019-1068-z,journal-article,2982198004

By forcing the X-chromosome to only be expressed in males over >40 generations, we changed the selection pressures on the X to become similar to those experienced by the Y. This releases the X from any constraints arising from selection in females and should lead to specialization for male fitness, which could occur either via direct effects of X-linked loci or trans-regulation of autosomal loci by the X. We found evidence of masculinization via up-regulation of male-benefit sexually antagonistic genes and down-regulation of X-linked female-benefit genes. Potential artefacts of the experimental evolution protocol are discussed and cannot be wholly discounted, leading to several caveats. Interestingly, we could detect evidence of microevolutionary changes consistent with previously documented macroevolutionary patterns, such as changes in expression consistent with previously established patterns of sexual dimorphism, an increase in the expression of metabolic genes related to mito-nuclear conflict and evidence that dosage compensation effects can be rapidly altered.

Although the ability to regulate cognitive assets during crises is seen as the hallmark of expertise in a resuscitation setting, the specific psychological strategies used by these domain experts and the patterns of their expression remain unknown. This study aims to combine traditional cognitive load rating scales with physiologic data from newer wearable devices to measure cognitive state of physician team leaders during real-life resuscitations. Eye-tracking, galvanic skin response, and heart rate measures were captured from five expert physicians during five trauma resuscitations. Physiologic measures were correlated with psychometric scores collected using a cued-recall debriefing protocol. Results varied between participants and trials; overall, skin conductance response amplitude and frequency and eye tracking metrics showed the strongest correlation to Paas scores. Regression analysis revealed that a quadratic model is more representative of the psychometric-physiologic relationship than a linear model for most measures.

The disease-defining molecular event characterizing the diagnosis of ASPS is the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion gene. Following identification of an index case of ASPS with a novel TFE3 fusion partner, we performed a retrospective review to determine whether this represents an isolated event. We identified two additional cases, for a total of three cases lacking ASPSCR1 partners. The average patient age was 46 years (range, 17-65); two patients were female. The sites of origin included the transverse colon, foot, and dura. Each case exhibited a histomorphology typical of ASPS, and immunohistochemistry was positive for TFE3 in all cases. Routine molecular testing of the index patient demonstrated a HNRNPH3-TFE3 gene fusion; the remaining cases were found to have DVL2-TFE3 or PRCC-TFE3 fusion products. The latter two fusions have previously been identified in renal cell carcinoma; to our knowledge, this is the first report of a HNRNPH3-TFE3 gene fusion.

While, deformation up to three FSP passes astonishingly followed a different trend, relative to the first pass. Achievement of a fine and homogenous microstructure in conjunction with the evolution of well-distributed particles and almost no sign of clusters were the outcomes of the third pass. Particularly, for the nanocomposite, a fine grain size of 2.29 μm is achieved. Additionally, better mechanical properties including higher values of Vickers microhardness and yield and also ultimate tensile strengths were attained after the third pass, compared to the first one. Better distribution of nanoparticles and their decisive role in improving tensile properties, compared to microparticles, led to the achievement of high hardness of 83 HV and ultimate tensile strength of 192 MPa for the graphene nanocomposite.

We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence around bevacizumab’s regulatory approval and withdrawal in mBC. Methods We searched for all published phase II or III clinical trials testing bevacizumab as a first-line therapy for patients with mBC. Data were extracted on trial demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was stratified by whether the trial was initiated before, during, or after the accelerated approval. We used a cumulative random-effects meta-analysis to assess the evolution of evidence of the effect of bevacizumab on PFS and OS. We estimated the association between the trial-level PFS and OS effect using a nonlinear mixed-regression model. Results Fifty-two studies were included. Trial activity dramatically dropped after the accelerated approval was withdrawn. Eight clinical trials reported hazard ratios (hazard ratios) and were meta-analyzed. The cumulative hazard ratio for PFS was 0.7 (95% CI = 0.6 to 0.79), and the cumulative hazard ratio for OS was 0.9 (95% CI = 0.8 to 1.01). The regression model showed a statistically nonsignificant association between PFS benefit and OS benefit (β = 0.43, SE = 0.81). Conclusion The US Food and Drug Administration’s decision-making in this case was consistent with the evolving state of evidence.

Our objective was to systematically review the current evidence for clinical and biochemical parameters that can be used to predict successful discontinuation of RRT. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed with a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of renal replacement therapy (IHD, CRRT, SLED), predictors of successful discontinuation or weaning (defined as an extended period of time free from further RRT), and patient outcomes. Major databases were searched and citations were screened using predefined criteria. Studied parameters were reported and, where possible, data was analyzed in the pooled analysis. Results Our search yielded 2 studies describing 1 variables for predicting the successful discontinuation of RRT. All studies were observational in nature. None were externally validated. Fourteen studies described conventional biochemical criteria used as surrogates of glomerular filtration rate (serum urea, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urine urea excretion, urine creatinine excretion). Thirteen studies described physiologic parameters such as urine output before and after cessation of RRT, and 1 studies reported on newer kidney biomarkers, such as serum cystatin C and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Six studies reported sensitivity and specificity characteristics of multivariate models. Urine output prior to discontinuation of RRT was the most-studied variable, with nine studies reporting. Pooled analysis found a sensitivity of 66.2% (95% CI, 53.6–76.9%) and specificity of 73.6% (95% CI, 67.5–79.0%) for urine output to predict successful RRT discontinuation. Due to heterogeneity in the thresholds of urine output used across the studies, an optimal threshold value could not be determined. Conclusions Numerous variables have been described to predict successful discontinuation of RRT; however, available studies are limited by study design, variable heterogeneity, and lack of prospective validation. Urine output prior to discontinuation of RRT was the most commonly described and robust predictor. Further research should focus on the determination and validation of urine output thresholds, and the evaluation of additional clinical and biochemical parameters in multivariate models to enhance predictive accuracy.",2020-02-13,Critical Care,https://openalex.org/V191417626,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-2751-8,,,24,1,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005795094,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-2751-8,journal-article,3005795094

Tolerant species were able to preserve CNS function at higher temperatures and for longer durations than sensitive species and similar differences were found for the behavioural indices (loss of coordination and onset of heat coma). Furthermore, the timing and temperature (constant and ramp exposure, respectively) for loss of coordination or complete coma coincided with the occurrence of spreading depolarisation (SD) events in the CNS. These SD events disrupt neurological function and silence the CNS suggesting that CNS failure is the primary cause of impaired coordination and heat coma. Heat mortality occurs soon after heat coma in insects and to examine if CNS failure could also be the proximal cause of heat death, we used selective heating of the head (CNS) and abdomen (visceral tissues). When comparing the temperature causing 50% mortality (LT50) of each body part to that of the whole animal, we found that the head was not particularly heat sensitive compared to the abdomen. Accordingly, it is unlikely that nervous failure is the principal/proximate cause of heat mortality in Drosophila.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,https://openalex.org/V20257348,The Company of Biologists,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.218750,,,,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3028176729,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.218750,journal-article,3028176729

Yet, how teacher-student relationships develop from moment-to-moment interactions during lessons remains understudied. The present study combined insights from interpersonal theory and dynamic systems approaches to study indices of interpersonal content and structure in teacher-student interactions and their association with the teacher’s interpersonal style. We found that moment-to-moment teacher behavior was indeed related to student perceptions of the teacher’s interpersonal style. Indices of variability (structure) in interactions discriminated between teachers with less preferred and more preferred interpersonal styles, while, contrary to earlier research, the indicator of predictableness of interactions could not.

In this review article, we argue that a ‘mobilities lens’ offers strong potential for rethinking established approaches, focusing on one important sub-field: work–family studies. Drawing on a ‘problematization’ approach (Sandberg and Alvesson, 2011) and a systematic literature review (SLR) of work–family research published from 1995 to 2015, we show how theoretical assumptions about time, space, and place have narrowed the scope of work–family studies, focusing attention on ‘time’ and ‘time-binds’, and a limited subset of mobilities (e.g. telework, commuting). We argue that a mobilities lens can help us ‘think differently’ about work–family dynamics, prompting theoretical and methodological reorientations that recognize the inextricable connection of time and space (as ‘time–space’) and the need for a more encompassing excavation of the power, practice, and meaning of employment-related mobility (ERM) in work–family life. We sketch out a ‘mobilities inspired’ agenda to illustrate how ideas from mobilities studies can enrich work–family inquiry.

Synthesis of shells on the initial Fe3O4 nanocores was carried out via the sol-gel technique. VSM, PSA, XRD, TEM, FE-SEM, EDS, FTIR and ZETA were analyses conducted for characterization. A 10-nm-passive layer of silica was formed between magnetic core and titania shell to inhibit direct contact of core and shell while superparamagnetic property was preserved. For TiO2 synthesis, it was found that the “concentration of water” and “mixing order of water and TBOT (Titanium butoxide)” had significant effect. Moreover, a minimum ratio of water to TBOT was required for TiO2 nucleation on Fe3O4–SiO2 (FS) seeds. Furthermore, an increment of water concentration to 3.8 M has led to 95% TiO2 coverage on FS nanoparticles. Results showed that FST nanoparticles were completely stable at pH = 7 and had acceptable zeta potential approximately −65 mV. Also, TiO2-coated magnetite nanoparticles (FT) were synthesized with the same condition of FST, but without silica midlayer, in order to observe th effect of SiO2 in nanostructure. Treatment of FST nanoparticles with E.coli showed 98% bacteria adsorption after 100 min, as well significant damage to bacteria cell membrane, was observed by SEM images. However, FT nanoparticles represented 82% bacteria removal with no harsh damage to the cells.

It has been extensively reported that the final classification accuracy of GEOBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Different supervised, unsupervised, and post-classification quality assessment approaches have been proposed to evaluate whether a segmentation result has acceptable quality. Although there have recently been some theoretical review papers on supervised approaches in the context of RS, there have not been any comprehensively experimental tests on comparing these approaches for nearly a decade. Considering this gap, we experimentally compared different recently proposed and popular segmentation evaluation metrics to help the users narrow down the metrics that can be reliably used to measure the quality of a segmentation in a supervised manner. We assessed 21 distinguishable under-segmentation (US), over-segmentation (OS), and combined (UO) metrics in a two-step experimental procedure. The experiments showed that the OS metrics (including Recall, OSeg, NSR, and OSE) and US metrics (Precision, USeg, PSE, USE, and PI) each suffered from some problems including, but not limited to, unsuitable weighting (e.g. NSR), not enough sensitivity to segmentation variations (e.g. OSE/USE), uncertainty/unreliability in some cases (e.g. USeg/PSE), etc. Although none of the UO metrics was able to find the most optimal segmentation found with visual inspection, the UO metrics including F_measure, QR, and SEI could identify an optimal segmentation that was still of high quality and was very similar to the one visually found. It was also found that these three UO metrics performed very similar to each other, and that OI2 and AFI also led to similar results although AFI’s unbounded range of values is a source of confusion about what is the most reliable way to choose optimal segmentations in this approach.",2020-02-01,ISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing,https://openalex.org/V4210188629,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.01.002,275,290,160,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999858079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.01.002,journal-article,2999858079

Early outcomes were all-cause mortality, reoperation for bleeding, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism/stroke. Long-term outcomes included all-cause mortality, reintervention, bleeding, and thromboembolism/stroke.

The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive compensatory interventions for psychosis by examining the effects on functioning and symptoms, and exploring whether intervention factors, study design, and age influenced effect sizes. Methods Electronic databases (Ovid Medline, PsychINFO) were searched up to October 2018. Records obtained through electronic and manual searches were screened independently by two reviewers according to selection criteria. Data were extracted to calculate estimated effects (Hedge’s g) of treatment on functioning and symptoms at post-intervention and follow-up. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Results Twenty-six studies, from 25 independent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis (1654 participants, mean age = 38.9 years, 64% male). Meta-analysis revealed a medium effect of compensatory interventions on functioning compared to control conditions (Hedge’s g = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.60, P &amp;lt; .001), with evidence of relative durability at follow-up (Hedge’s g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.54, P &amp;lt; .001).

The movement and architecture of free-phase gas can have important implications on the expected effect of stray gas migration. For example, free-phase gas can become trapped in the subsurface and then dissolve, or gas flow can reach the surface. In this study, intermediate-scale laboratory experiments in quasi-two-dimensional flow cells employing a modified light transmission method were used to better understand free-phase gas migration under gravity-destabilized conditions. Quantification of both gas movement and saturation improves our understanding of the expected source architecture of stray gas.

Oxidative stress promotes LOAD, so we have developed an oxidative stress-based model of age-related cognitive impairment based on gene deletion of aldehyde dehydrogenase  (ALDH2). This enzyme is important for the detoxification of endogenous aldehydes arising from lipid peroxidation. Compared to wildtype (WT) mice, the knockout (KO) mice exhibit a progressive decline in recognition and spatial memory and AD-like pathologies. Here we performed morphometric analyses in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions (dCA1 and vCA1) as well as in overlying primary sensory cortex to determine if altered neuronal structure can help account for the cognitive impairment in 12-month old KO mice. Dendritic morphology was quantitatively analyzed following Golgi-Cox staining using  WT mice (10 neurons) and 1 KO mice (18 neurons). Four pyramidal neurons were traced per mouse in each region, followed by branched structured analysis and Sholl analysis. Compared to WT controls, the morphology and complexity of dCA1 pyramidal neurons from KOs showed significant reductions in apical and basal dendritic length, dendrite intersections, ends, and nodes. As well, spine density along dorsal CA1 apical dendrites was significantly lower in KO versus WT. In contrast, pyramidal arborization in the vCA1 and primary sensory cortex were only minimally reduced in KO versus WT mice. These data suggest a region-specific vulnerability to oxidative stress-induced damage and/or a major and specific reduction in synaptic input to the pyramidal neurons of the dorsal hippocampus.

The ignition of methane-air, equivalence ratios of 0.25, 0. and 1.0, was studied using the reflected shock technique. High-speed schlieren and direct photography (taken obliquely to the shock tube axis) in an optically accessible 76 mm square cross-section test section were used to identify ignition sites in three-dimensional space and to obtain the ignition delay time, corroborated with pressure measurements. Tests were carried out at a nominal reflected pressure of 10 bar and temperatures in the range of 880–1500 K. The ignition process started with multiple flame kernels, randomly distributed throughout the mixture, which resulted in a slow rise in pressure. Above a critical reflected shock temperature, this relatively slow deflagration process abruptly terminated with strong ignition, believed to correspond to the onset of a detonation. The location of the detonation initiation was random, and typically occurred away from the end-wall.

Preventive interventions are urgently needed. Objective To design a randomized controlled trial to assess a novel intervention that aims to prevent ADRD in high-risk groups. Methods We report on the rationale and describe the design of a multisite randomized controlled trial that aims to prevent ADRD in older persons with: (1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI); (2) remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) without MCI; or (3) remitted MDD with MCI. Results PACt-MD (Prevention of Alzheimer's dementia with Cognitive remediation plus transcranial direct current stimulation in Mild cognitive impairment and Depression) is a trial that randomized 37 older participants with MCI, MDD, or MCI + MDD to cognitive remediation (CR) plus transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or sham-CR + sham-tDCS for 5 days/week for 8 weeks followed by boosters for 5 days/week once every  months until participants progress to MCI or ADRD, or the end of the study. Between boosters, participants are asked to train on CR daily. At baseline, end of 8 weeks, and yearly from baseline, participants undergo clinical, cognitive, and functional assessments. The primary aims are to compare the efficacy of CR + tDCS versus sham + sham in preventing: 1) long-term cognitive decline; and 2) incidence of ADRD or MCI. The secondary aim is to assess for cognitive improvement after the 8-week course. We will also explore the moderating and mediating effects of several biomarkers collected from the participants. Conclusion PACt-MD is unique in combining brain stimulation and a psychosocial intervention to prevent ADRD. PACt-MD is also a platform for studying multi-domain biomarkers that will advance our understanding of the relationships among MCI, MDD, and ADRD.",2020-01-01,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,https://openalex.org/V25155249,IOS Press,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-200141,,,,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036373787,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-200141,journal-article,3036373787

A total of 56 patients were randomized to one of two treatments which were applied for four months with a five month follow up assessment. Comparisons were between (1) Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) - a treatment that uses environmental supports and weekly home visits to compensate for cognitive challenges and improve community functioning and (2) Action Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) - a treatment involving computerized cognitive drill and practice exercises, simulations, goal setting, and behavioral activation. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated significant effects on community functioning for both CAT and ABCR without a difference between conditions (n = 39), with an indication of greater gains at follow up in the ABCR group (n = 31). Improvements in symptomatology were less robust with mixed findings across neurocognition metrics.

However, previous research has not considered whether the amount of perceived knowledge a person has about the topic might moderate these effects. Across eight studies on different topics using a variety of outcome measures, the current research demonstrates that perceived knowledge can moderate the relation between ambivalence and the impact of attitudes on related thinking, judging, and behaving.

By requiring active engagement of patients and other stakeholders, several government research funders have advanced this model, particularly in Canada, the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. A consortium of individuals from these countries formed a Multi-Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) consortium to examine critical issues in engaged research, establish consensus on definitions, and provide guidance for the field, beginning with an overview of how to involve stakeholders in health research (Concannon et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2019;34(3):458-463) and continuing here with an examination of definitions of research engagement. The political and advocacy roots of engaged research are reflected in definitions. Engagement is conceptualized with reference to research project goals, from informing specific clinical decisions to informing health-system level decisions. Political and cultural differences across countries are evident. Some of these government funders focus on empirical rather than ethical rationales. In countries with centralized health technology assessment, the link between societal values and engaged research is explicit. Ethical rationales for engagement are explicit in most of the published literature on research engagement. Harmonization of definitions is recommended so that research engagement elements, methods, and outcomes and impacts can be clearly examined and understood, and so that the field of research engagement can proceed from a clear conceptual foundation. Specific recommendations for terminology definitions are provided.

These effects require attention in today's changing climate to properly quantify emissions, reduce risk and inform sound policy decisions. Flowing subsurface GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide, present a risk in the form of two environmental expressions: i) to the atmosphere (surface expression) and ii) to shallow groundwater (aqueous expression). Results based on high-resolution observations in an analog experimental system and analytical modelling show that these expressions depend on the rate of gas flow and the velocity of the flowing groundwater. In deeper systems, the emission of flowing subsurface GHGs could be significantly limited by dissolution into groundwater, adversely impacting water resources without surficial evidence of an underlying issue.

We investigated how contrasting summer and autumn precipitation can shape annual and inter-annual variation in ecosystem carbon (C) flux (gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and CO 2 efflux) in two subtropical lakes differing substantially in trophic state and water color. Instrumented buoys recorded time series of free-water DO, terrestrial DOM (tDOM), chlorophyll a , water temperature profiles, and meteorological measurements over five years (2009–2011 and 2014–2015). Reduced precipitation caused immediate and prolonged effects on C flux in both lakes. During the drought year (2014) GPP and ER declined by 6 to 80% and both lakes were either CO 2 sinks or neutral. In the subsequent wet year (2015), GPP and ER increased by 4 to 110%, and both lakes shifted to strong net CO 2 emitters. Higher ecosystem R resulted from larger GPP while higher tDOM contributed to a dramatic increase in dissolved inorganic carbon, which intensified CO 2 emission in both lakes. C flux was more responsive in the clear mesotrophic lake, declining by approximately 40% in the cumulative GPP and ER, and increasing by >400% in CO 2 efflux whereas changes in the oligotrophic colored lake were more modest (approximately 30% and 300% for metabolic declines and efflux increases, respectively). Temporal variation and magnitude of C flux were governed by tDOM-mediated changes in epilimnetic nutrient levels and hypolimnetic light availability. This study demonstrated terrestrial loads of DOM strongly influence the inter-annual response and sensitivity of ecosystem C flux to variation in inter-annual precipitation. Our findings have important implications for predicting the trend, magnitude, duration, and sensitivity of the response of C flux in subtropical lakes/reservoirs to future changes in precipitation patterns under altered climatic conditions. • Effects of droughts on inter-annual C fluxes were studied in subtropical lakes. • Multi-parameter probes were deployed to record key parameters over five years. • Lakes shifted from a C sink in dry year to C source in subsequent normal year. • C fluxes were more responsive to droughts in the mesotrophic colored lake. • Terrestrial DOM serves as a driver for the response of lakes to droughts.",2020-05-15,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137052,137052,137052,717,,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004822752,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137052,journal-article,3004822752

At the onset of dehydration there is some supercooling of body fluids, and the danger of inoculative freezing, which would be lethal. To see if the springtails are protected by antifreeze proteins in this pre-equilibrium phase, we examined extracts from cold-acclimated M. arctica and recorded over  °C of freezing point depression. Proteins responsible for this antifreeze activity were isolated by ice affinity. They comprise isoforms ranging from 6.5 to 16.9 kDa, with an amino acid composition dominated by glycine (&gt;35 mol%). Tryptic peptide sequences were used to identify the mRNA sequence coding for the smallest isoform. This antifreeze protein sequence has high similarity to one characterized in Hypogastrura harveyi , from a different springtail order.

The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88%, 80%, and 60% when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively.",2020-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,https://openalex.org/V144771191,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2894522,397,409,21,1,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2912561618,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2894522,journal-article,2912561618

A solar photovoltaic plant along with a battery energy storage system (PV-BESS) can provide a long-term solution to cope with increasing energy costs, thus reducing the tension with other societal competing needs for a key resource such as clean energy. However, sizing these systems is challenging, in face of uncertain ore grindability and solar power availability. In this paper, we present an application of an integrated model to size the PV-BESS, where the variability of ore grindability is modeled using geostatistical tools, solar irradiance variability is captured using a Markov chain simulation model, and the entire system is optimized through linear stochastic optimization, considering a fixed mine schedule for the feed of a semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill. The main goals are to minimize the costs associated with operating the SAG mill in the presence of a PV-BESS system, understand how the sizing and costs change under the influence of stochastic drivers, and reveal the potential for demand-side management in mines. The size and costs of the necessary infrastructure are determined for a model of estimated grindability and an ensemble of 50 simulated models of grindability, and compared against the sizing and cost of the ground truth. The effect of climate change on solar energy availability is accounted for by forecasting the ratio of excellent, good, and moderate days over bad days in terms of irradiance out to the year 2030. Finally, the effects of stockpiles and feed control according to the processing plant needs, namely a demand-side management approach, are evaluated to reveal the impact on the energy requirements and the sizing of the photovoltaic and storage system. The model is optimized considering a yearly cost function, with hourly resolution for the solar irradiance and hardness models. The results show that integrating solar power into the operation of a SAG mill has potential to reduce the total energy cost by 27%. Robustness against climate change can be achievedwith an increase in total cost of 1%. Finally, use of stockpiles to manage the ore supply to the mill and minimize the energy cost to process it results in a cost reduction of around 2%, which should offset the rehandling cost of managing the stockpiles.",2020-04-01,Mathematical Geosciences,https://openalex.org/V195293963,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11004-019-09816-6,355,379,52,3,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955914538,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11004-019-09816-6,journal-article,2955914538

We track morphology in situ using coherent imaging, providing an immediate check on surface roughness, recoater blade damage, and powder packing density. Defects are corrected through manual closed-loop control; protrusions and depressions identified by in situ imaging are compensated through laser ablation and refilling, respectively, during a 3D build.

RESULTS Antegrade cerebral perfusion was found on multivariable analysis to be protective against mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.86; P = 0.005], stroke (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81; P = 0.006), composite of mortality or stroke (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45–0.72; P = 0.0001) and STS-COMP (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41–0.67; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as compared to HCA alone. Retrograde cerebral perfusion yielded similar outcomes as compared to antegrade cerebral perfusion. When compared to HCA with nadir temperature &amp;lt;24°C, a propensity score analysis of 64 matched pairs identified nadir temperature ≥24°C as predictor of lower mortality (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40–0.98; P = 0.04), stroke (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31–0.84; P = 0.008), composite of mortality or stroke (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43–0.89; P = 0.01) and STS-COMP (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49–0.85; P = 0.002).

This study examined whether the secretory products of commensal gut bacteria can modulate the excitability of vagal afferent neurons with cell bodies in nodose ganglia. Cysteine proteases from commensal bacteria increased the excitability of vagal afferent neurons via activation of protease-activated receptor  and modulation of the voltage dependence of Na+ conductance activation. Lipopolysaccharide, a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, increased the excitability of nodose ganglia neurons via TLR4-dependent activation of nuclear factor kappa B. Our study identified potential mechanisms by which gut microbiota influences the activity of vagal afferent pathways, which may in turn impact on autonomic reflexes and behaviour. Abstract Behavioural studies have implicated vagal afferent neurons as an important component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms underlying the ability of the gut microbiota to affect vagal afferent pathways are unclear. We examined the effect of supernatant from a community of 3 commensal gastrointestinal bacterial derived from a healthy human donor (microbial ecosystem therapeutics; MET-1) on the excitability of mouse vagal afferent neurons. Perforated patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the excitability of dissociated nodose ganglion (NG) neurons. NG neuronal excitability was assayed by measuring the amount of current required to elicit an action potential, the rheobase. MET-1 supernatant increased the excitability of NG neurons by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependence of activation of Na+ conductance. The increase in excitability elicited by MET-1 supernatant was blocked by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (30 nm). The protease activated receptor-2 (PAR2 ) antagonist (GB 83, 1 μm) also blocked the effect of MET-1 supernatant on NG neurons. Supernatant from Lactobacillus paracasei 6MRS, a component of MET-1, recapitulated the effect of MET-1 supernatant on NG neurons. Lastly, we compared the effects of MET-1 supernatant and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 05:B5 on NG neuron excitability. LPS increased the excitability of NG neurons in a toll-like receptor  (TLR4 )-dependent and PAR2 -independent manner, whereas the excitatory effects of MET-1 supernatant were independent of TLR4 activation. Together, our findings suggest that cysteine proteases from commensal bacteria increase the excitability of vagal afferent neurons by the activation of PAR2 .",2020-06-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279075,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009535446,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279075,journal-article,3009535446

The objective of this study was to develop a population-based case-finding strategy to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed airflow obstruction (asthma or COPD) amongst adults with respiratory symptoms in Canada. Methods Adults without a previous history of asthma, COPD or lung disease were recruited using random digit-dialling and asked if they had symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum or wheeze within the past  months. Those who answered affirmatively completed the Asthma Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), COPD-Diagnostic Questionnaire (COPD-DQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Those with an ASQ score of ≥ or a COPD-DQ score of ≥2 underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry to diagnose asthma or COPD. Results 1 11 individuals were contacted at home and assessed for study eligibility. Of the 126 eligible individuals, 91 (72%) enrolled and underwent spirometry. Ultimately, 18 subjects (20% of those enrolled) had obstructive lung disease (73 asthma and 11 COPD). Individuals found to have undiagnosed asthma or COPD had more severe respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life compared with those without airflow obstruction. The ASQ, COPD-DQ, and CAT had ROC areas for predicting undiagnosed asthma or COPD of 0.49, 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. Four descriptive variables (age, BMI, sex and pack-years smoked) produced better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values than the questionnaires (ROC area=0.68).

This might be particularly problematic with enteral medications due to metabolic abnormalities and impaired gastrointestinal tract absorption common in critically ill patients. Utilizing enteral fish oil, this study was undertaken to better understand and define PK of enteral omega-3 fatty acids (eicospentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. Materials and methods Healthy volunteers (n = 15) and mechanically ventilated (MV) adults with severe sepsis (n = 10) were recruited and received 9.75 g EPA and 6.75 g DHA daily in two divided enteral doses of fish oil for 7 days. Volunteers continued their normal diet without other sources of fish oil, and sepsis patients received standard enteral feeding. Blood was collected at frequent intervals during the 14-day study period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and neutrophils were isolated and analyzed for membrane fatty acid (FA) content. Mixed linear models and t-tests were used to analyze changes in FA levels over time and FA levels at individual time points, respectively. PK parameters were obtained based on single compartment models of EPA and DHA kinetics. Results Healthy volunteers were 41.1 ± 10.3 years; 67% were women. In patients with severe sepsis (55.6 ± 13.4 years, 50% women), acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score was 27.2 ± 8.8 at ICU admission and median MV duration was 10.5 days. Serum EPA and DHA were significantly lower in sepsis vs. healthy subjects over time. PBMC EPA concentrations were generally not different between groups over time, while PBMC DHA was higher in sepsis patients. Neutrophil EPA and DHA concentrations were similar between groups. The half-life of EPA in serum and neutrophils was significantly shorter in sepsis patients, whereas other half-life parameters did not vary significantly between healthy volunteers and sepsis patients. Conclusions While incorporation of n-3 FAs into PBMC and neutrophil membranes was relatively similar between healthy volunteers and sepsis patients receiving identical high doses of fish oil for one week, serum EPA and DHA were significantly lower in sepsis patients. These findings imply that serum concentrations and EPA and DHA may not be the dominant driver of leukocyte membrane incorporation of EPA and DHA. Furthermore, lower serum EPA and DHA concentrations suggest that either these n-3 FAs were being metabolized rapidly in sepsis patients or that absorption of enteral medications and pharmaconutrients, including fish oil, may be impaired in sepsis patients. If enteral absorption is impaired, doses of enteral medications administered to critically ill patients may be suboptimal.",2020-03-01,Clinical Nutrition,https://openalex.org/V102860386,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.03.040,958,965,39,3,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2936147479,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.03.040,journal-article,2936147479

Exposure data collected from g-Force accelerometers mounted to the helmet of each player were used to split participants into HIGH ( N = 22) and LOW ( N = 22) exposure groups, based on the frequency of impacts sustained by each athlete. Significant decreases in grey-matter volume specific to the HIGH group were documented at POST ( P = 0.009), compared to baseline. Changes in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF 0 ), corrected for partial volume effects, were observed within the HIGH group, throughout the season ( P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that alterations in perfusion may follow exposure to sub-concussive collisions. Co-localized significant increases in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO  | 0 ) mid-season were also documented in the HIGH group, with respect to both PRE- and POST values. No physiological changes were observed in the LOW group. Therefore, cerebral metabolic demand may be elevated in players with greater exposure to head impacts.

This climate change forever modified the biogeochemical cycling of iron and phosphorus, ended large-scale iron formation deposition, began accumulation of phosphorus on marine shelves, and led to the Ediacaran radiation of eukaryotes. The Jacadigo Basin, Brazil, contains a nearly complete record of this critical transition. Glaciomarine diamictites and iron formation accumulated during two Marinoan ice advances with hydrothermal input of iron delivered via ice-margin upwelling. Biochemically precipitated rhythmites of siderite, sedimentary apatite, and hematite represent microbially mediated, sub-sea ice precipitation. Siderite laminae preserve microbial textures and have a mean ∂13C = −8.80‰, PDB (+/−0.86‰) reflecting degradation of organic matter at the seafloor. These millimeter-scale rhythmites are a sensitive record of sub-ice dynamics because they formed in response to short-term fluctuations of O2 due to seasonal sub-ice photosynthesis. They demonstrate the connection between ice cover, O2, and cycling of iron and nutrient elements such as phosphorus. These biochemical rhythmites suggest that Cryogenian sea ice limited oxygen production prior to the onset of the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event. O2 increased enough to concentrate bioavailable phosphorus at the seafloor, which was essential for later diversification of metazoans in the Ediacaran. Such sub-ice Cryogenian biochemical systems may provide Earth-based analogs for life on ice-covered worlds, such as Europa and Enceladus.",2020-02-01,Precambrian Research,https://openalex.org/V1025118869,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105533,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988215101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105533,journal-article,2988215101

Due to a lack of environmental control and regulations at that time, it was common for mines to dispose of their waste into adjacent lakes and land depressions, concentrating metals and metalloids in sensitive aquatic ecosystems. In order to examine what impacts, if any, these century-old, arsenic-rich mine tailings are having on present-day aquatic ecosystems, we sampled diatom assemblages in lake surface sediment in 24 lakes along a gradient of surface water arsenic contamination (0.4-972 μg/L). In addition, we examined sedimentary Cladocera and chironomid abundances and community composition, as well as open-water zooplankton communities and chlorophyll-a concentrations in of these study lakes along a gradient of arsenic contamination (0.9-1113 μg/L). Our results show that present-day arsenic concentration is not a significant driver of biotic community composition of the organisms we studied, but instead, that other variables such as lake depth and pH were more important in structuring assemblages. These results suggest that, while legacy contamination has greatly increased metal concentration beyond historical conditions, variability in lake-specific controls among the study lakes appear to be more important in the structuring of diatom, Cladocera, chironomidae, and zooplankton in these lakes.",2020-03-20,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136212,136212,136212,709,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994857310,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136212,journal-article,2994857310

This study investigates the relationship between calcium supplement use and the 5 year progression of abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) in participants from one center of the Canadian Multi-Centre Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS). Methods Participants (n = 296; 21 women and 7 men) had lateral spine X-rays and DEXA bone mineral density (BMD) scans (femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip) taken at two time points within a 5 year interval. AAC was assessed using the Framingham Method. Calcium supplement use was assessed by a facilitated health history questionnaire and medication inventory. Results AAC significantly increased over 5 years, AAC progression was significantly greater in calcium supplement users, as compared to non-users, overall and in females. The amount of calcium was positively correlated to AAC progression. A multi-variable linear regression model was generated for women only, as there were not enough men for multivariable modelling. Calcium supplement use and amount remained significantly associated with AAC progression after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes and smoking history. Change in AAC score was not associated with change in BMD T-Score. In univariate analyses of males, calcium supplement use was associated with a significantly greater BMD loss at the lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck. Conclusions Older female calcium supplement users had significantly higher AAC progression over 5 years, but did not have any significant BMD preservation.

As AgNP become more prevalent, the doses to which humans are exposed may increase and pose health risks, particularly through incidental inhalation. This exposure was evaluated through in-vitro methods simulating lung fluids and lung epithelium, and through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods of AgNP transport. A high-dose scenario simulated a short-term inhalation of 1 μg AgNP/m3, based on an exposure limit recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health for the case of a health-care worker who handles AgNP-infused wound dressings, and regularly wears AgNP-imbedded clothing. Bioaccessibility tests were followed by a Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) and supported by CFD models of the lung alveoli, membrane, pores, and blood capillaries. Results indicate that such exposure produces an average and maximum AgNP flux of approximately 4.7 × 10-2 and 6.5 × 10-1 mol m-2·s-1 through lung tissue, respectively, yielding a blood-silver accumulation of 0.46-64 mg per year, which may exceed the lowest adverse effect level of 2 mg for an adult male. Results from in-silico simulations were consistent with values estimated in vitro (within an order of magnitude), which suggest that CFD models may be used effectively to predict silver exposure from inhaled AgNP. Although the average short-term exposure concentrations are  orders of magnitude smaller than the reported threshold for mammalian cytotoxicity effects (observed at 500 ppb), cumulative effects resulting from constant exposure to AgNP may pose risks to human health in the long-term, with predicted bioaccumulation reaching potential toxic effects after only five months of exposure, based on maximum flux.",2020-04-01,Environmental Pollution,https://openalex.org/V201530359,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113880,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998351666,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113880,journal-article,2998351666

However, it has been limited to mainly noble metals because of the challenges encountered when using non-noble metals. We report on the development of controlled-atmosphere flame fusion that enables the growth of spherical single crystals of non-noble metals in controlled gaseous atmosphere and without the formation of surface or bulk oxides. The set-up is used to grow nickel single crystals the structure of which is verified using Laue X-ray back-scattering and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Therefore, the identification of potential rockfall locations is of high importance. Susceptibility is the magnitude that describes these locations and its qualitative and quantitative assessment is necessary for the timely treatment of potential events. Quantitative susceptibility assessment can be conducted using either data-driven methods such as bivariate and multivariate statistics as well as artificial neural networks or numerical methods such as static and dynamic models. In both approaches mathematical assumptions have to be made concerning the predisposing factors distribution and so there is an inherent need to achieve the higher possible confidence level in the input data. Such high-resolution data can be acquired using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanners. In the current study, LiDAR technology was implemented, and the data processing technique is analyzed step by step providing the reader with a view of the whole procedure. The results produced by the current methodology are validated and interpreted according to in situ measurements and observations based on unmanned aerial vehicle imagery. Post data processing, joint orientation, joint spacing and potential block volumes were extracted considering both persistent and non-persistent joints. The proposed methodology provides the creation of detailed high-resolution spatial distribution maps of the previously mentioned parameters, considering the variability of their values along the slope. The results can be used in a space-resolved susceptibility assessment providing higher-resolution input data for the subsequent susceptibility analysis.",2020-06-01,Geotechnical and Geological Engineering,https://openalex.org/V202628778,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10706-020-01203-x,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004090977,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10706-020-01203-x,journal-article,3004090977

Design, setting, participants, &amp; measurements Using provincial-linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a population-based study of incident patients who initiated maintenance dialysis between 200 and 201 and survived for at least 90 days. We defined high primary care physician continuity as both a high usual provider of care index (where &gt;75% of primary care physician visits occurred with the same primary care physician) in the 2 years before dialysis (an established measure of primary care physician continuity) and at least one visit with the same primary care physician in the 90 days after dialysis initiation. We used propensity scores to match a group of patients with high and low continuity so that indicators of baseline health were similar. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included all-cause and disease-specific hospitalizations during the 2 years after maintenance dialysis initiation. Results We identified 19,099 eligible patients. There were 661 patients with high primary care physician continuity, of whom 6391 (97%) were matched to 6391 patients with low primary care physician continuity. High primary care physician continuity was not associated with a lower risk of mortality (14.5 deaths per 10 person-years versus 15.2 deaths per 10 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.02). There was no difference in the rate of all-cause hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.01), and high primary care physician continuity was not associated with a lower risk of any disease-specific hospitalization, except for those related to diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 0.97).

Method: A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the prescribing of ADHD medications between 2005 and 2015 using electronic medical record data. Yearly prevalence and incidence of ADHD medication prescribing were calculated for preschoolers (up to  years old), school-aged children (6-17 years old), and adults (18-65 years old) along with a description of the types of ADHD medications prescribed between 2005 and 2015. Results: Between 2005 and 2015, there was a 2.6-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD medication prescribing to preschoolers, a 2.5-fold increase in school-aged children, and a fourfold increase in adults. There was a corresponding rise in incidence of prescribing although this rise was moderate and estimates were much lower compared with prevalence. The most commonly prescribed medication was Methylphenidate (65.0% of all ADHD medications prescribed). Conclusion: Although the prevalence of ADHD has remained stable over time, this study found an increase in the prescribing of ADHD medications in all age groups between 2005 and 2015.

Although increased frequency of peer victimization has been linked to psychosocial problems, few researchers have studied the role of duration and pervasiveness of victimization (i.e., number of places it occurs). The objective of this study was to examine how frequency, duration, and pervasiveness of peer victimization are associated with youth adjustment. Canadian adolescents (N = 879), ages 12-18 completed an online survey about experiences with peer victimization. Youth also answered questions about internalizing problems, distress, relationship quality with family, friends, and adults in their school and community, as well as academic functioning. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression modeling. Both duration and pervasiveness of peer victimization were predictive of increased internalizing problems, distress, relationship problems, and academic difficulties. Duration and pervasiveness of peer victimization were identified as important factors to consider when predicting youth psychosocial adjustment.

We examined whether intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and neurological dysfunction prior to surgery, measured by robotic technology, are important predictors of post-operative performance following CABG surgery.Adult patients undergoing CABG surgery were recruited for this single-center prospective observational study. Intraoperative rSO2 was captured using the FORESIGHT cerebral oximeter. Neurological assessment was performed pre-operatively and 3 months following surgery using robotic technology and a standardized pen-and-paper assessment. Linear regression models were generated to determine the predictive ability of both intraoperative rSO2 and pre-operative performance on post-operative neurological outcome.Forty patients had complete data available for analysis. Quantified pre-operative performance accounted for a significantly larger amount of variance in post-operative outcome compared to intraoperative rSO2. In particular, pre-operative scoring on a cognitive visuospatial task accounted for 82.2% of variance in post-operative performance (b = 0.937, t(37) = 12.98, p = 1.28e-5).Our results suggest that pre-operative performance is a stronger indicator of post-operative neurological outcome than intraoperative rSO2, and should be included as an important variable when elucidating the relationship between cerebral oxygen levels and post-operative neurological impairment.

The goals of the present report were to examine relations between objective treatment engagement (number of sessions attended, amount of homework completed) and self-reported motivation (intrinsic motivation and perceived competence to complete cognitive training) with neurocognitive and functional outcomes from cognitive training.Data from a clinical trial comparing two cognitive training approaches in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were utilized in the current report (n = 38). Relations were examined between baseline intrinsic motivation, perceived competence, homework completion, and session attendance with improvements in neurocognition, functional competence, and community functioning.Number of sessions attended (r = 0.38) and time doing homework (r = 0.51) were significantly associated with improvements in neurocognition. Homework completion was associated with change in community functioning at a trend-level (r = 0.30). Older age was associated with greater treatment engagement (β = 0.37) and male biological sex was associated with greater self-reported motivation (β = 0.43). Homework completion significantly mediated the relationship between session attendance and neurocognitive treatment outcomes.Objective measures of treatment engagement were better predictors of treatment outcomes than subjective measures of motivation.

For all three objectives, we derive lower bounds on the smallest channel capacity $C_0$ above which the objective can be achieved with an arbitrarily small error.

Understanding the risk factors linking falls, fear of falling, and activity restriction is critical for developing effective programs to increase activity levels among persons with disabilities. OBJECTIVES To determine if differences exist in the level of physical activity in people with different types of conditions associated with disability and to investigate if fear of falling is associated with physical activity in individuals who are aging with a long-term disability. DESIGN Cross-sectional retrospective design. SETTING Community. PARTICIPANTS A convenience sample of 1812 community-dwelling individuals who had one of four diagnoses: multiple sclerosis (MS), muscular dystrophy (MD), spinal cord injury (SCI), or post-polio syndrome (PPS). METHODS Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and analysis of variance, followed by multivariate linear regression analysis were used to examine the association between physical activity status and fear of falling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Physical activity volume and fear of falling. RESULTS After controlling for age, sex, duration of disability, and mobility level, there was variation across diagnostic groups (P < .001). People with SCI reported greater physical activity (M = 25.19) compared to other groups (MS: M = 18.70; MD: M = 21.83; PPS: M = 15.47). Patients with PPS had the greatest concerns about falling (M = 16.08), and patients with MS had the lowest (M = 13.12). Fear of falling was associated with physical activity (P < .001), which remained significant after controlling for diagnosis type, falls history, and level of mobility.

Road surface anomalies contribute to increasing the risk of traffic accidents, reduced driver comfort and increased vehicles’ damage. The conventional integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) positioning solutions can suffer from errors because of inertial sensor noises and biases, especially when low-cost and commercial grade inertial sensors are used. In this work, we use a reduced inertial sensor system utilizing Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) based inertial sensors, to integrate with the GNSS receiver and provide robust positioning in urban canyons. To provide acceptable performance in challenging urban environments, our method de-noises the MEMS-based inertial sensor measurements using a technique based on a Bi-orthonormal search, which separates the monitored motion dynamics from both the inertial sensor bias errors and high-frequency noises. As a result, the performance of the positioning system is improved, providing reliable positioning accuracy during extended GNSS outages that occur in various areas. To show the significant enhancement achieved by the proposed approach, we examined the system performance over three road test trajectories involving MEMS-based inertial sensors and GNSS receivers mounted on our test vehicle.

To address this gap, a survey of medical oncologists and a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Methods A survey was distributed in March 201 to medical oncologists who treat colon cancer within Alberta, Canada. Clinicians were asked to rank the prognostic importance of a set of variables using a Likert scale and agreement was quantified using a weighted Cohen's kappa. In addition, we systematically searched four databases up to July 2019. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Results Of the 2 clinicians who were sent the survey, 1 responded. Overall, there was no agreement regarding which variables were prognostic of early discontinuation (weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.05-0.18). From an initial 392 articles, 1 investigations were identified for inclusion in our review. Based upon evidence from both the survey and the systematic review, the following four variables were identified as being prognostic of early discontinuation: (a) comorbidity (OR2+ vs  = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.30-1.79); (b) performance status (ORECOG 2+ vs 0-1 = 1.33; 95%CI = 1.07-1.65); (c) T stage (ORT4 vs T1-2 = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.99-2.50); and (d) chemotherapy regimen (estimates not pooled due to heterogeneity).

In this study, a square channel equipped with 50% blockage ratio obstacles was used. Average velocity measurements coupled with high-speed schlieren photography and sooted glass sheets were used to simultaneously capture wave propagation and triple-point trajectories from multiple fields-of-view. Experiments were carried out in mixtures of stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen at initial pressures between 9 kPa and 60 kPa in a 3.66 m long, by 7.62 cm square cross-section channel with optical access. Results show that the increased channel width results in a lower maximum pressure for which fast-flame propagation occurs. At higher initial pressures, detonation kernels were initiated at the obstacle face-sidewall interface in either a symmetrical (both sides) or an asymmetrical (single side) formation across the channel width. Wall reflection generated detonations evolve to form transverse detonations propagating diagonally across the channel width in the shock-compressed region following the obstacle. The single wall ignition was found to lead to a stable single-head “zig-zag” detonation (diagonal propagation driven by sidewall reflection) at initial pressures from 17 kPa to 24 kPa where transverse detonation reflection leads to the generation of a reactive Mach stem that survives diffraction at the next obstacle pair. Soot foils displayed a unique narrow vertical band of cells where the transverse wave collides with the channel sidewall in this propagation mode, which is the only mode to not involve obstacle reflection re-initiation. The channel width w, being larger than the obstacle opening d, makes it possible for the transverse modes seen in an obstacle-free channel to lock in, like the single-head detonation propagation observed. Continuous detonation propagation through the channel core was seen at high CJ velocity deficits beginning at d/λ = 6.3, where λ is the detonation cell width, with higher initial pressures having cellular structure reach the channel walls between obstacles. Thus, continuous detonation propagation is governed by the diffraction process around the obstacles and d is the governing length scale.",2020-05-01,Combustion and Flame,https://openalex.org/V32869529,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.01.027,145,156,215,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005916011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.01.027,journal-article,3005916011

The purpose of this review is to report on the current methods of investigating patellofemoral mechanics, factors that affect joint function, and future directions in patellofemoral joint research with emerging technologies and techniques.While previous hypotheses have suggested that the patella is only a moment arm extender, recent literature has suggested that the patella influences the control of knee moments and forces acting on the tibia as well as contributes to various aspects of patellar function with minimal neural input. With advancements in simulating a six-degrees-of-freedom patellofemoral joint, we have gained a better understanding of patella motion and have shown that geometry and muscle activations impact patella mechanics. Research into influences on patella mechanics from other joints such as the hip and foot has become more prevalent. In this review, we report current in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches to studying the patellofemoral joint. Kinematic and anatomical factors that affect patellofemoral joint function such as patella alta and tilt or bone morphology and ligaments are discussed. Moving forward, we suggest that advanced in vivo dynamic imaging methods coupled to musculoskeletal simulation will provide further understanding of patellofemoral pathomechanics and allow engineers and clinicians to design interventions to mitigate or prevent patellofemoral pathologies.",2020-05-11,Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine,https://openalex.org/V82625836,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09626-y,326,337,13,3,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024810650,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09626-y,journal-article,3024810650

Modern analog reconstructions of average temperature from Holocene pollen assemblages of Charland Lake showed temperature was ~2°C warmer than present conditions ~7800–4500 cal. yr BP, a time period consistent with the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). Pollen data suggest a two-phase HTM: warm and dry conditions based on the presence of primarily Pinus spp., followed by warm and wet conditions based on increases in cedar. Overall, algal production was low during the HTM, as reflected by low concentrations of pigments and diatoms. In the late HTM, increases in cedar pollen and planktonic diatoms suggest sustained increases in water levels for the remainder of the Holocene. During the Post-HTM Period (~4500–2000 cal. yr BP), a period that was warmer than today but cooler than the HTM, overall pigment production was significantly higher than all other periods. However, changes in diatom species composition suggest this period was not uniform, with variation occurring between diatoms indicative of higher and lower nutrient levels. The last ~2000 cal. yr BP was less productive than the Post-HTM Period but more productive than the HTM with higher production from diatoms and cyanobacteria.

Celebrities and everyday citizens, traditional news and social media alike were aflame around the globe, most notably after American celebrity Jimmy Kimmel expressed disgust in Cecil's death during a monologue on his late-night talk show. This paper explores the Cecil Moment as a case study of the cultural politics of the environment at the intersection of celebrity environmentalism and ‘Nature 2.0’ applications like Facebook and Twitter. The research asks: what can the Cecil Moment can tell us about how celebrity and Nature 2.0 environmentalisms work and to what kind of conservation politics do they lead? Drawing on the celebrity environmentalism and Nature 2.0 literatures, I develop an analytic framework for analyzing the Cecil Moment which considers and evaluates the network of actors enrolled, the representations foregrounded and backgrounded, as well as the outcomes. Empirical insights are drawn from document and media review, and key informant interviews. I argue that the Cecil Moment operated through a more-than-human network which served to channel agency unleashed by Cecil’s death to the already-empowered lion conservation actors, as well as mutable meanings that shifted Cecil Moment focus away from trophy hunting and toward lion conservation in general. Ultimately, the Cecil Moment operated to dismiss the anti-trophy hunting politics that sparked and fuelled it in the first place; yet, the momentum of the Cecil Moment was grasped and re-directed toward other lion conservation priorities. Critically, this re-direction was not neutral; rather, it shifted the politics of the Cecil Moment in a way that reproduced longstanding patterns of conservation injustice wherein blame for biodiversity loss is directed away from powerful forces onto the racialized, rural poor from the Global South.",2020-01-01,Geoforum,https://openalex.org/V169586356,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.10.015,194,203,108,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988727173,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.10.015,journal-article,2988727173

This paper describes a method for using audit and feedback, an evidence-based knowledge translation strategy, to support implementation of participation-focused practice in front-line services, to identify barriers to implementation, and to enable international benchmarking of implementation and barriers. Method Best-practice guidelines for using audit and feedback were followed. For audit, participation-focused practice was specified as clinicians' three observable behaviours: (a) targets participation outcomes; (b) involves child/parent in setting participation outcomes; and (c) measures progress towards participation outcomes. For barrier identification, the Theoretical Domains Framework Questionnaire (TDFQ) of known implementation barriers was used. A cycle of audit and barrier identification was piloted in three services (n = 25 clinicians) in a large U.K. healthcare trust. From each clinician, up to five randomly sampled case note sets were audited (total n = 122), and the clinicians were invited to complete the TDFQ. For feedback, data on the behaviours and barriers were shared visually and verbally with managers and clinicians to inform action planning. Results A Method for using Audit and feedback for Participation implementation (MAPi) was developed. The MAPi audit template captured clinicians' practices: Clinicians targeted participation in 37/122 (30.3%) of the sampled cases; involved child/parent in 16/122 (13.1%); and measured progress in 24/122 (19.7%). Barriers identified from the TDFQ and fed back to managers and clinicians included clinicians' skills in participation-focused behaviours (median = 3.00-5.00, interquartile range [IQR] = 2.25-6.00), social processes (median = 4.00, IQR = 3.00-5.00), and behavioural regulation (median = 4.00-5.00, IQR = 3.00-6.00). Conclusions MAPi provides a practical, off-the-shelf method for front-line services to investigate and support their implementation of participation-focused practice. Furthermore, as a shared, consistent template, MAPi provides a method for generating cumulative and comparable, across-services evidence about levels and trends of implementation and about enduring barriers to implementation, to inform future implementation strategies.",2020-01-01,Child Care Health and Development,https://openalex.org/V140531128,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12723,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992181822,https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12723,journal-article,2992181822

The gold mineralization is hosted predominantly by Pontiac Group metasedimentary rocks, Piche Group metavolcanic rocks, and quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite porphyritic intrusions. The ore takes the form of a low-grade envelope of disseminated pyrite (0.35 to 1 g/t Au) grading inwards into higher grade (>1 g/t Au) stockwork and breccia zones. Hydrothermal alteration in the metasedimentary rocks is zonally distributed around the fluid pathways. Proximal alteration is characterized by a microcline±albite-quartz replacement-type assemblage, with lesser phlogopite, calcite±Fe-dolomite, pyrite and rutile. The distal alteration assemblage comprises biotite, microcline±albite, phengite, quartz, calcite, pyrite and rutile. In this study, we assess the magnitude and distribution of fluid-rock interaction in the metasedimentary rocks of the Malartic district. The metaturbidites are separated into four lithotypes based on grain-size to reduce the effects of primary depositional processes on mass change calculations. Despite the variability in protolith composition, the metasedimentary rocks define a geochemically consistent, cogenetic sequence. The results of the mass transfer calculations indicate progressive gains in CO2, S, K2O and LOI, as well as Au, Te, W, Ag, As, Be, Sb, Bi, Mo and Pb, from background, to distal and proximal alteration zones (relative to the least-altered samples). Molar element ratio analysis (alkali/aluminum) indicates an increase in alkali metasomatism (K and Na) adjacent to the main hydrothermal fluid pathways, which is manifested by the progressive stabilization of microcline and albite at the expense of oligoclase, biotite and white mica. Ore-associated pathfinder elements delineate broad enrichment patterns around the deposit, and are used to understand hydrothermal fluid circulation in the Malartic district. A statistical approach based on a comparison of the mass change results with the background composition provides robust constraints on the magnitude and extent of the lithogeochemical haloes. Generally, the alteration forms envelopes that extend along the S2 fabric, with the largest lithogeochemical anomalies (e.g., Au, W, Te and Ag) reaching up to 10 km in length, and 2 km in width.

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is associated with a considerable public health burden worldwide, but whether NO 2 exposure is causally related to IHD morbidity remains in question. Our objective was to determine whether short term exposure to outdoor NO 2 is causally associated with IHD-related morbidity based on a synthesis of findings from case-crossover and time-series studies. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Health and Toxline databases were searched using terms developed by a librarian. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts between reviewers were resolved through consensus and/or involvement of a third reviewer. Pooling of results across studies was conducted using random effects models, heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using Cochran’s Q and I 2 measures, and sources of heterogeneity were evaluated using meta-regression. Sensitivity of pooled estimates to individual studies was examined using Leave One Out analysis and publication bias was evaluated using Funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s tests, and trim and fill. Results Thirty-eight case-crossover studies and 4 time-series studies were included in our analysis. NO 2 was significantly associated with IHD morbidity (pooled odds ratio from case-crossover studies: 1.07 95% CI 1.052–1.097; pooled relative risk from time-series studies: 1.02 95% CI 1.016–1.029 per 1 ppb). Pooled estimates for case-crossover studies from Europe and North America were significantly lower than for studies conducted elsewhere. The high degree of heterogeneity among studies was only partially accounted for in meta-regression. There was evidence of publication bias, particularly for case-crossover studies. For both case-crossover and time-series studies, pooled estimates based on multi-pollutant models were smaller than those from single pollutant models, and those based on older populations were larger than those based on younger populations, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions We concluded that there is a likely causal relationship between short term NO 2 exposure and IHD-related morbidity, but important uncertainties remain, particularly related to the contribution of co-pollutants or other concomitant exposures, and the lack of supporting evidence from toxicological and controlled human studies.",2020-05-01,Environmental Health,https://openalex.org/V191320764,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00601-1,,,19,1,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3020882052,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00601-1,journal-article,3020882052

As tumors progress, they begin to express stem-cell associated proteins, concomitant with the emergence of therapy resistant metastatic disease. For example, invasive breast cancers often secrete the embryonic morphogen, NODAL. NODAL has been shown to promote angiogenesis, therapy resistance and metastasis in breast cancers. However, to date, little is known about how this secreted protein may interact with cells in the TME. Herein we explore how NODAL in the TME may influence γδ T cell function. We have assessed the proximity of γδ T cells to NODAL in a cohort of triple negative breast tumors. In all cases in which γδ T cells could be identified in these tumors, γδ T cells were found in close proximity to NODAL-expressing tumor cells. Migration of γδ and αβ T cells was similar toward MDA-MB-231 cells in which NODAL had been knocked down (shN) and MDA-MB-231 scrambled control cells (shC). Furthermore, Vδ γδ T cells did not migrate preferentially toward conditioned medium from these cell lines. While 24-h exposure to NODAL did not impact CD69, PD-1, or T cell antigen receptor (TCR) expression on γδ T cells, long term exposure resulted in decreased Vδ TCR expression. Maturation of γδ T cells was not significantly influenced by NODAL stimulation. While neither short- nor long-term NODAL stimulation impacted the ability of γδ T cells to kill MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the absence of NODAL resulted in greater sensitivity of targets to γδ T cell cytotoxicity, while overexpression of NODAL conferred resistance. This appeared to be at least in part due to an inverse correlation between NODAL and surface MICA/B expression on breast cancer target lines. As such, it appears that NODAL may play a role in strategies employed by breast cancer cells to evade γδ T cell targeting, and this should be considered in the development of safe and effective γδ T cell immunotherapies.",2020-06-19,Frontiers in Immunology,https://openalex.org/V2595292759,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01287,,,11,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036559517,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01287,journal-article,3036559517

The Perception of Bullying in Male Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Although there is evidence to suggest that adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty interpreting complex social situations, little is known about their understanding of bullying. Given the high rates of victimization in this population, it is important to investigate how adolescents with ASD comprehend bullying. Male adolescents with ASD and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls (Mage = 14.62, SD = 1.91) watched six videos portraying bullying scenarios and were interviewed after each video. The interviews were coded for the participants' understanding of the bullying scenarios. Results indicated that adolescents with ASD had significantly lower bullying understanding scores than TD adolescents. These novel findings suggest that male adolescents with ASD understand bullying differently than their TD peers. Implications for experiences with victimization are discussed.",2020-05-01,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,https://openalex.org/V181451930,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-018-3739-y,1822,1826,50,5,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2888863912,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-018-3739-y,journal-article,2888863912

Based on data at four temperatures (40, 55, 75, and 85 °C), the time to antioxidant depletion of the textured portion of a 1.5 mm core thickness high-density polyethylene (HDPE) GMB is 40% (standard oxidative induction time) and 9% (high-pressure oxidative induction time) faster compared to the 1.5 mm smooth edge of the GMB. However, despite this, stress crack resistance results show that texturing may have no significant effect on the time to nominal failure for this GMB.

We ascertained the presence of acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of nondialysis-requiring acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis with mortality, procedural complications, and discharge destination. <h3>Results</h3> We identified 836 patients who underwent left ventricular assist device implantation, of whom 376 (45.0%) experienced nondialysis-requiring acute kidney injury and 42 (5.1%) experienced acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. In-hospital mortality was 3.9% for patients without acute kidney injury, 12.2% for patients with nondialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, and 47.4% for patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Patients with nondialysis-requiring acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis had higher adjusted odds of mortality (3.24, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04-5.13 and 20.8, 95% CI, 9.7-44.2), major bleeding (1.38, 95% CI, 1.08-1.77 and 2.44, 95% CI, 1.47-4.04), sepsis (2.69, 95% CI, 1.93-3.75 and 5.75, 95% CI, 3.46-9.56), and discharge to a nursing facility (2.15, 95% CI, 1.51-3.07 and 5.89, 95% CI, 2.67-12.99). <h3>Conclusions</h3> More than 1 in 1 patients with acute kidney injury and approximately 1 in  patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis died during their hospitalization, with only 30% of patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis discharged to home.

Model parameters were obtained from uniaxial tensile experiments conducted over a range of displacement rates. The model was implemented in geometrically-nonlinear finite-element-analysis and was able to match the force, displacement and strain measured from wide-width strip tensile experiments. The analysis also matched the geomembrane response measured from axisymmetric force-displacement experiments, where a 60-mm-diam. specimen, clamped around its perimeter, was subjected to loading normal to its plane from a steel probe machined to mimic the shape of a coarse gravel particle. The analysis matched: i) probe forces when loaded at a constant rate of displacement, ii) displacements when loaded with step function increments of probe force, iii) creep displacements under a constant probe force for 1000 h, and iv) decreases in probe force from stress relaxation when held at a constant displacement for 1000 h.

Advanced robotic systems have been used for scanning structures located in remote areas or that pose significant hazards to personnel. However, due to their inherent resource limitations, the current solution is to transfer all applicable sensor data to a ground station where detection will occur at a later time, thereby preventing real-time decision based on the results. To allow on-board decision making, in this article, a crack detection particle filter is optimized for parallel computation and implemented onto an Field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

However, the marker response and survival outcome are usually associated with some potentially unobservable factors. In this case, the conventional statistical methods that model these two outcomes separately may not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a joint model for marker response and survival outcomes for clustered data, providing efficient statistical inference by considering these two outcomes simultaneously. We focus on a special type of marker response: a binary outcome, which is investigated together with survival data using a cluster-specific multivariate random effect variable. A multivariate penalized likelihood method is developed to make statistical inference for the joint model. However, the standard errors obtained from the penalized likelihood method are usually underestimated. This issue is addressed using a jackknife resampling method to obtain a consistent estimate of standard errors. We conduct extensive simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed joint model and inference methods in different scenarios. The simulation studies show that the proposed joint model has excellent finite sample properties compared to the separate models when there exists an underlying association between the marker response and survival data. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a symptom control study conducted by Canadian Cancer Trials Group to explore the prognostic effect of covariates on pain control and overall survival.",2020-02-10,Statistics in Medicine,https://openalex.org/V55189604,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8403,326,339,39,3,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990278103,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8403,journal-article,2990278103

Reflexive learning is a mode of learning that takes place during policy formulation and is most likely to occur in policy areas marked by considerable uncertainty and complexity (low problem tractability) and the participation of a wide range of actors (low actor certification). We contend that reflexive learning processes can restructure policy problems and widen the menu of available policy options and prompt policy elites and citizens to collectively update their beliefs, resulting in policy innovation. We probe the plausibility of this mechanism of policy change through a comparative study of universal pre-kindergarten policy making in the US and Canada. Through two paired comparisons (Florida and California; Ontario and Alberta), we find that policy innovation occurs when publics are engaged in policy formulation through iterative, ongoing public consultation on policy instruments and settings.

Exposure to air fresheners, candles, mold, cats, dogs, carpet, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during the prenatal, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year time points were obtained. A skin prick test (SPT) was performed on both the mother and the 2-year-old child.Exposure to candles during the prenatal window, cats during the 6-month window, and ETS at 2 years significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) of a positive SPT result (candles: OR, 5.096; 95% CI, 1.69-13.86; P = .006; cat: OR, 4.267; 95% CI, 1.096-15.68; P = .048; and ETS: OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.189-11.18; P = .04).

Methods This was a cross-sectional study that used survey data collected from 305 students in grades 6–1 (approximate ages 11–15 years) from Ontario, Canada. Students reported whether or not they had a medically diagnosed concussion within the previous 1 months and the frequency that they participated in several risky behaviours including fighting, bullying, smoking, drinking alcohol, using illicit drugs, drinking caffeinated beverages, not using protective equipment, and having unsafe sex. Responses to the risky behavior items were used to create a MRB score. The association between MRB and concussion was explored using logistic regression that controlled for several confounding variables. Results Approximately 10.7% of students reported that they had a medically diagnosed concussion within the past year. A dose-response relationship was found between MRB and concussion among students in grades 9–10, while in grades 6–8 students only those in the highest MRB quartile had an increased likelihood of concussion. The relative odds for concussion in the highest versus the lowest MRB quartile were 4.67 (95% confidence interval: 2.33, 9.35) in grades 9–10 students and 2.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.90, 4.56) in grades 6–8 students.

Enrichments in ore and pathfinder elements are generally limited to a few hundred meters beyond the pit areas, and the peripheral alteration is restricted to narrow (1–3 cm) halos around a low density of prehnite and/or epidote veinlets. It is, therefore, challenging to recognize the alteration footprint peripheral to the porphyry Cu systems. Here, we document a workflow to maximize the use of lithogeochemical data in measuring changes in mineralogy and material transfer related to porphyry formation by linking whole-rock analyses to observed alteration mineralogy at the hand specimen and deposit scale. Alteration facies and domains were determined from mapping, feldspar staining, and shortwave infrared imaging and include (1) K-feldspar halos (potassic alteration), (2) epidote veins with K-feldspar–destructive albite halos (sodic-calcic alteration), (3) quartz and coarse-grained muscovite veins and halos and fine-grained white-mica–chlorite veins and halos (white-mica–chlorite alteration), and two subfacies of propylitic alteration comprising (4) prehnite veinlets with white-mica–chlorite-prehnite halos, and (5) veins of epidote ± prehnite with halos of chlorite and patchy K-feldspar. Well-developed, feldspar-destructive, white-mica alteration is indicated by (2[Ca-C] + N + K)/Al values &amp;lt;0.85, depletion in CaO and Na2O, enrichment in K2O, and localized SiO2 addition and is spatially limited to within ~200 m of porphyry Cu mineralization. Localized K2O, Fe2O3, and depletion in Cu, and some enrichment in Na2O and CaO, occurs in sodic-calcic domains that form a large (~3 km2) nonconcentric footprint outboard of well-mineralized and proximal zones enriched in K. Water and magmatic CO2-rich propylitic and sodic-calcic–altered rocks form the largest lithogeochemical footprint to the mineralization in the Highland Valley Copper district (~6 km2). Calcite in the footprint is interpreted to have formed via phase separation of CO2 from a late-stage magmatic volatile phase. Several observations from this study are transferable to other porphyry systems and have implications for porphyry Cu exploration. Feldspar staining and shortwave infrared imaging highlight weak and cryptic alteration that did not cause sufficient material transfer to be confidently distinguished from protolith lithogeochemical compositions. Prehnite can be a key mineral phase in propylitic alteration related to porphyry genesis, and its presence can be predicted based on host-rock composition. Sodic-calcic alteration depletes the protolith in Fe (and magnetite) and, therefore, will impact petrophysical and geophysical characteristics of the system. Whole-rock loss on ignition and C and S analyses can be used to map enrichment in water and CO2 in altered rocks, and together these form a large porphyry footprint that extends beyond domains of enrichment in ore and pathfinder elements and of pronounced alkali metasomatism.",2020-06-01,Economic geology and the bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists,https://openalex.org/V4210182989,Society of Economic Geologists,https://doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4733,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021769060,https://doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4733,journal-article,3021769060

A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance will improve treatment efficacy through genetic testing and novel therapies. Methods Using data from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we classified those who remained progression-free for 1 months following platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy as “chemo-sensitive” ( N = 160) and those who had recurrence within  months as “chemo-resistant” ( N = 110). Univariate and multivariate analysis of expression microarray data were used to identify differentially expressed genes and co-expression gene networks associated with chemotherapy response. Moreover, we integrated genomics data to determine expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Results Differential expression of the Valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) gene and five co-expression gene networks were significantly associated with chemotherapy response in HGSOC. VCP and the most significant co-expression network module contribute to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, which has been implicated in chemotherapy response. Both univariate and multivariate analysis findings were successfully replicated in an independent ovarian cancer cohort. Furthermore, we identified 19 cis-eQTLs associated with the expression of network genes and  cis-eQTLs associated with BRCA2 expression.

Recent evidence suggests that responses elicited by different cues are mechanistically distinct from each other, though these differences have received little attention. Further, the effects are not well studied in neural tissue. In this study, we examined how brief exposure to desiccation and chilling affect ion homeostatic mechanisms in metathoracic ganglion of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Both desiccation and chilling enhanced resistance to anoxia, though only chilling hastened recovery from anoxic coma. Similarly, only chilling enhanced resistance to pharmacological perturbation of neuronal ion homeostasis.

Internal and External Motivations to Report Honestly,"We create and validate measures capturing internal and external motivations to report honestly as trait‐like characteristics. Both measures have high levels of reliability, as well as convergent and divergent validity. To test their predictive validity, we conduct two experiments. In the first experiment, MTurk participants have the opportunity and incentive to misreport with no immediate consequences, and in the second experiment, participants with management experience report how they would make a hypothetical accounting allocation decision. In both experiments, we find that participants who are higher in internal motivations to report honestly are more likely to report honestly than those lower in internal motivations, confirming this measure's predictive validity. Both experiments also provide limited support for the predictive validity of our external measure, finding that those who are higher in external motivation do not report differently than those who are lower in external motivations in the absence of controls. Our study also reveals that individuals who are higher in internal motivations have a diminished reaction to different management controls: MTurk participants to a control that punishes misreporting, and manager participants to a control that rewards honest reporting. Results suggest that management and those charged with governance should consider that some employees can react negatively to controls that are perceived as constraining. Our measures are useful to researchers who investigate honest reporting by allowing them to identify, ex ante, individuals who want to be honest versus wanting to appear honest.

 In nineteenth-century British India, concern regarding large numbers of asylum patients with ‘Indian Hemp Insanity’ led to establishment of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. The exotic cannabis plant was widely used in pharmacopeia and a source of government revenue. The Commission was tasked with determining the public health risks of cannabis use, particularly mental illness. This analysis of the Commission report seeks to highlight the status of 1892 cannabis research and compare it with current evidence for medical and recreational cannabis use. Methods
 Detailed historiographic review of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report (1892). Results
 In 1892, heavy cannabis use was considered to have been associated with severe mental illness (7.3% of asylum patients; 12.6% of patients with diagnoses). About two-thirds were children and young adults with higher relapse rates. Risk increased with early cannabis use and a family history of mental illness. Cannabis psychosis was found to have a shorter trajectory and better prognosis than other mental illnesses in the asylums. Different cannabis potency and modes of consumption had different effects. Occasional cannabis use was felt to have medicinal benefits for some. Appendices provided symptoms and demographic characteristics of cannabis-induced mental illness. Conclusion
 This important nineteenth-century study observed frequency and dose-related effects of cannabis on mental health, particularly psychotic symptoms in young people with a previous or hereditary risk of mental illness. Pathophysiological observations were consistent with current knowledge.

Micro dispensing is concerned with jetting of liquids through nozzles with a typical diameter on the order of magnitude of 100 microns. In this work, various aspects of micro dispensing of a Newtonian liquid are studied, including jet break-up and the (equilibrium) profile of a printed line on a substrate. Contrary to the investigations of others, this work is concerned with jets of high Froude (Weber) numbers in the range of 4 ≲ Fr ≲ 150 (  ≲ We ≲ 100 ) . Phenomenological correlations between the liquid properties, dispensing conditions and the jet break-up ratio are inferred based on dimensional reasoning and a comprehensive set of experiments. These correlations are used to create maps that indicate stable dispensing regimes. Furthermore, when the liquid is dispensed from the nozzle, the jet diameter usually contracts over the jet length. An analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, valid to describe the shape of gravity-driven jets, is modified to obtain a correlation for inertia-driven jets. Finally, a correlation is derived to (numerically) obtain the three-dimensional profile of a liquid that is dispensed on a flat substrate.",2020-02-01,Chemical Engineering Journal,https://openalex.org/V149937609,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.122645,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2971263217,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.122645,journal-article,2971263217

This has been attributed to muscle pump-mediated venous emptying and subsequent widening of the arterial to venous pressure gradient, which can occur below but not above heart level. However, alternative explanations could include greater rapid onset vasodilatation and/or transmural pressure-mediated mechanical distension of resistance vessels, but these remain unexplored. We demonstrate that active vasodilatation is not responsible for greater post-contraction hyperaemia below the heart. Instead, an increased transmural pressure-mediated mechanical distension of resistance vessels is a key mechanism responsible for this phenomenon. Our findings establish the importance of considering/accounting for local mechanical arteriolar distension effects when investigating exercise hyperaemia. They also inform the application of exercise for rehabilitative purposes and prompt investigation into whether arteriolar distension accompanying vasodilatation is reduced with diseases or ageing, thereby compromising exercising muscle perfusion. ABSTRACT We tested the hypotheses that increased post-contraction hyperaemia in higher (H; below heart) vs. lower (L; above heart) transmural pressure conditions is due to (1) greater active vasodilatation or (2) greater transmural pressure-mediated arteriolar distension. Participants (n = 20, 1 male,  female; combined mean age 24.5 ± 2 years) performed a 2 s isometric handgrip contraction, where arm position was maintained within or changed between H and L during contraction, resulting in four starting-finishing arm position conditions (LL, HL, LH, HH). Post-contraction forearm blood flow (echo and Doppler ultrasound) was higher with contraction release in H vs. L environments (P < 0.05). However, contraction initiated in H did not result in greater vasodilatation (forearm vascular conductance; FVC) than contraction initiated in L, regardless of contraction release condition (peak FVC: LL 217 ± 104 vs. HL 204 ± 92 ml min-1 (100 mmHg)-1 , P = 0.313, LH 229 ± 8 vs. HH 225 ± 85 ml min-1 (100 mmHg)-1 , P = 0.391; first post-contraction cardiac cycle FVC: same comparisons, both P = 0.317). However, FVC of the first post-contraction cardiac cycle was greater for contractions released in H vs. L regardless of pre-contraction condition (LL 106 ± 67 vs. LH 152 ± 76 ml min-1 (100 mmHg)-1 , P < 0.05; HL 80 ± 51 vs. HH 119 ± 58 ml min-1 (100 mmHg)-1 , P < 0.05). These findings refute the hypothesis that greater hyperaemia following a single contraction in higher transmural pressure conditions is due to greater active vasodilatation. Instead, our findings reveal a key role for increased transmural pressure-mediated mechanical distension of arterioles in creating a greater increase in vascular conductance for a given active vasodilatation following skeletal muscle contraction.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278476,85,99,598,1,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981905744,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278476,journal-article,2981905744

Survival times of retene-exposed embryos were 7 % longer at 5 °C than at 11 °C, but survival times and LC50 s did not vary when time was expressed as degree-days (thermal units), i.e., at a common stage of development. The size of survivors decreased with increasing retene concentrations, but not with temperature. Retene did not bioconcentrate to any extent (bioconcentration factors < 2) at either temperature, indicating effective biotransformation by embryos. However, concentrations of retene metabolites were slightly higher at 5 °C, suggesting slower excretion rates than at 11 °C. The relative expression of cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP1A) did not vary with temperature but increased with retene concentration, as indicated by cyp1a mRNA concentrations. The induction of CYP1A protein by retene exposure was evident in the vasculature of eye, brain, heart, kidney, liver, gill, mouth, intestine, muscle, and yolk-sac. However, immunohistochemical staining was greater at 5 than at 11 °C for all tissues except liver and muscle.

Design Parents of competitive youth ice hockey players (N = 437) read a vignette that either described a parent from the participant’s own team (i.e., ingroup), or a parent from an opposing team (i.e., outgroup) acting antisocially towards an athlete from the participant’s own team, an opposing athlete, or their own child. Parents were asked whether they would respond to the antisocial behaviour in the form of direct or indirect criticism or report the behaviour to the coach or to the league. Results Parents were more likely to directly criticize ingroup parents than outgroup parents and they were more likely to indirectly criticize outgroup parents than ingroup parents. Further, parents with stronger social identities reported higher intentions to indirectly criticize an outgroup parent. There were no main effects for reporting behaviour (to coach or league), and personal identity did not moderate relationships with moral intentions towards antisocial behaviour.

While cognitive training has produced reliable improvements in neurocognition and functioning, little is known about factors that moderate treatment response. Electroencephalographic (EEG) measures provide a neurophysiological indicator of cognitive functions that may moderate treatment outcomes from cognitive training.Data from a clinical trial comparing two cognitive training approaches in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were utilized in the current report. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify participant clusters based on baseline P300, mismatch negativity (MMN), and theta power during an n-back task, and the EEG measures were also examined as continuous predictors of treatment response.Three clusters were identified based on the baseline EEG variables; however, there were no significant differences in treatment response across the three clusters. Higher P300 amplitude and theta power during the n-back at baseline were significantly associated with greater improvements in a cognitive composite score post-treatment. None of the EEG measures were significantly associated with treatment outcomes in specific cognitive domains or community functioning. Change in EEG measures from baseline to post-treatment was not significantly associated with durability of cognitive or functional change at 12-week follow-up.Clusters derived from the EEG measures were not significantly associated with either neurocognitive or functional outcomes.

Here, we focus on the mechanisms for encoding reach targets relative to visual landmarks in humans. First, we consider the behavioral results suggesting that both of these cues influence target memory, but are then transformed-at the first opportunity-into egocentric commands for action. We then consider the cortical mechanisms for these behaviors. We discuss different allocentric versus egocentric mechanisms for coding of target directional selectivity in memory (inferior temporal gyrus versus superior occipital gyrus) and distinguish these mechanisms from parieto-frontal activation for planning egocentric direction of actual reach movements. Then, we consider where and how the former allocentric representations of remembered reach targets are converted into the latter egocentric plans. In particular, our recent neuroimaging study suggests that four areas in the parietal and frontal cortex (right precuneus, bilateral dorsal premotor cortex, and right presupplementary area) participate in this allo-to-ego conversion.

This, in turn, necessitates approximating the segment angular velocity. Methods can be distinguished by the way in which a segment is defined and the assumptions used for estimating the segment angular velocity. However, isolating foot-ankle performance from overall prosthetic system performance is limited by uncertainties in the definition of angular velocity of a deformable segment. A deformable link segment (DLS) analysis is proposed that provides a means for estimating deformation velocity of a deformable segment without first approximating the angular velocity: the deformation velocity and angular velocity are solved simultaneously at each instant during the stance phase of gait. DLS analysis was compared to two approaches in the literature: the distal foot (DF) model and the unified deformable (UD) segment model during over-ground walking for three trans-tibial prosthesis users. DLS and UD segment estimates of deformation velocity were comparable when applied to the UD segment. Furthermore, DLS analysis enables modelling of deformable prosthetic foot-ankle components separately from other prosthetic componentry.

In the latter stages of the war, inspired by Family Medicine programs in countries such as Canada, plans to rebuild a new system founded on a strong primary care model emerged. Over the next fifteen years, the Queen’s University Family Medicine Development Program in Bosnia and Herzegovina played an instrumental role in rebuilding the primary care system through educational initiatives at the undergraduate, residency, Masters, PhD, and continuing professional development levels. Changes were supported by new laws and regulations to insure sustainability. This study revisited Bosnia and Herzegovina (B-H) 8-years after the end of the program to explore the impact of initiatives through understanding the perspectives and experiences of individuals at all levels of the primary care system from students, deans of medical schools, Family Medicine residents, practicing physicians, Health Center Directors and Association Leaders.

Three major themes and  subthemes were identified including (1) The Development of Family Medicine Education, (subthemes: establishment of departments of family medicine, undergraduate medical curriculum change), (2) Family Medicine as a Discipline (Family Medicine specialization, academic development, and Family Medicine Associations), and (3) Health Care System Issues (continuity of care, comprehensiveness of care, practice organization and health human resources). Conclusions Despite the impact of years of war and the challenges of a complex and unstable postwar environment, initiatives introduced by the Queen’s Program succeeded in establishing sustainable changes, allowing Family Medicine in B-H to continue to adapt without abandoning its strong foundations. Despite the success of the program, the undervaluing of Primary Care from a human resource and health finance perspective presents ongoing threats to the system.",2020-01-13,BMC Family Practice,https://openalex.org/V153257185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-1079-4,,,21,1,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004904496,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-1079-4,journal-article,3004904496

While it is recognized that thymic cells are audited to optimize an organism's immune repertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favor high-quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at early stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is here made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality control mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through detection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental DNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically derived. This stress test is achieved in the same way that thymic screening for potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved-by expression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes that are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire gene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes function in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid incompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents (rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins that are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this basis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in gamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant protein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been co-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to remove potentially autoreactive T cells.",2020-06-01,Theory in Biosciences,https://openalex.org/V12148721,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12064-019-00306-1,,,,,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980961667,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12064-019-00306-1,journal-article,2980961667

Was NATO successful in institutionalizing self-restraint and cooperative security among its new members and partners? We contend that it was successful so long as threats to transatlantic security remained low. When states perceive that the threat is increasing, however, more traditional conceptions of national identity displace the cooperative security model. While a great deal of institutional learning happened through the process of NATO accession and partnership building in the past two decades, the socialization process stopped short of transforming new members’ security mindsets. Our main contribution, then, is to provide an accurate picture of NATO’s influence in terms of reshaping the transatlantic security community and to analyze the different versions of NATO that were proposed in the post-Cold War era.",2020-06-01,International Politics,https://openalex.org/V157128309,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41311-020-00240-w,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021182962,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41311-020-00240-w,journal-article,3021182962

The primary goal of this work is to analyse the multiplicative structure of the Birkhoff polytope of order 3 (the simplest nontrivial case). A suitable complex parametrization of the Birkhoff polytope is proposed, which reveals several its symmetries and characteristics, in particular: (i) the structure of Markov semigroups inside the Birkhoff polytope, (ii) the relation between the set of Markov time evolutions, the set of positive definite matrices and the set of divisible matrices. A condition for Markov time evolution of semigroups in the set of symmetric bistochastic matrices is derived, which leads to an universal conserved quantity for all Markov evolutions.

Transperineal in-bore MRI-guided prostate biopsy (tpMRgBx) is a targeted biopsy technique that was shown to be safe, efficient, and accurate. Our goal was to develop an open source software platform to support evaluation, refinement, and translation of this biopsy approach. Methods: We developed SliceTracker, a 3D Slicer extension to support tpMRgBx. We followed modular design of the implementation to enable customization of the interface and interchange of image segmentation and registration components to assess their effect on the processing time, precision, and accuracy of the biopsy needle placement. The platform and supporting documentation were developed to enable the use of software by an operator with minimal technical training to facilitate translation. Retrospective evaluation studied registration accuracy, effect of the prostate segmentation approach, and re-identification time of biopsy targets. Prospective evaluation focused on the total procedure time and biopsy targeting error (BTE). Results: Evaluation utilized data from 73 retrospective and ten prospective tpMRgBx cases. Mean landmark registration error for retrospective evaluation was 1.88 ± 2.6 mm, and was not sensitive to the approach used for prostate gland segmentation. Prospectively, we observed target re-identification time of 4.60 ± 2.40 min and BTE of 2.40 ± 0.98 mm. Conclusion: SliceTracker is modular and extensible open source platform for supporting image processing aspects of the tpMRgBx procedure.

We performed an exploratory analytical substudy of adducts during a clinical trial (NACSTOP) of abbreviated (12-hour) versus control (20-hour) acetylcysteine to identify any signal of diminished antidotal effectiveness with shortened therapy.MethodsWe measured adducts at 0, 12, and 20 hours from a convenience sample of subjects enrolled in the cluster-controlled NACSTOP trial evaluating a 12-hour (“abbreviated”; 200 mg/kg over 4 hours, 5 mg/kg over  hours) vs 20-hour acetylcysteine regimen (“control”; 200 mg/kg over 4 hours, 10 mg/kg over 1 hours).
