In the absence of reliable means for grouping known Bacillus species into distinct clades, restricting the placement of new species into this genus has proven difficult. To clarify the evolutionary relationships among Bacillus species, 35 available genome sequences from the family Bacillaceae were used to perform comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses. Four phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on multiple datasets of proteins including 117 core Bacillaceae proteins, 8 proteins conserved within the phylum Firmicutes, GyrA–GyrB–RpoB–RpoC proteins, and UvrD–PolA proteins. All trees exhibited nearly identical branching of Bacillus species and consistently displayed six novel monophyletic clades encompassing 5–23 Bacillus species (denoted as the Simplex, Firmus, Jeotgali, Niacini, Fastidiosus and Alcalophilus clades), interspersed with other Bacillaceae species. Species from these clades also generally grouped together in 16S rRNA gene trees. In parallel, our comparative genomic analyses of Bacillus species led to the identification of 3 molecular markers comprising conserved signature indels in protein sequences that are specifically shared by the species from these six observed clades, thus reliably demarcating these clades based on multiple molecular synapomorphies. Based on the strong evidence from multiple lines of investigations supporting the existence of these six distinct ‘ Bacillus ’ clades, we propose the transfer of species from these clades into six novel Bacillaceae genera viz. Peribacillus gen. nov., Cytobacillus gen. nov., Mesobacillus gen. nov., Neobacillus gen. nov., Metabacillus gen. nov. and Alkalihalobacillus gen. nov.

Purpose To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers. Data Extraction Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Data Synthesis Four RCTs were meta-analyzed adjusting for clustering. Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory-confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I2 = 0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95% CI: 0.98-2.28; I2 = 78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P = .49). Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. Conclusions Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non–aerosol-generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.",2020-07-01,Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses,https://openalex.org/V93534766,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12745,365,373,14,4,1,260,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014615840,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12745,journal-article,3014615840

Here we identify an unexpected inhibitory role of energy stress on ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We found that ferroptotic cell death and lipid peroxidation can be inhibited by treatments that induce or mimic energy stress. Inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy status, largely abolishes the protective effects of energy stress on ferroptosis in vitro and on ferroptosis-associated renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. Cancer cells with high basal AMPK activation are resistant to ferroptosis and AMPK inactivation sensitizes these cells to ferroptosis. Functional and lipidomic analyses further link AMPK regulation of ferroptosis to AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Our study demonstrates that energy stress inhibits ferroptosis partly through AMPK and reveals an unexpected coupling between ferroptosis and AMPK-mediated energy-stress signalling.",2020-02-06,Nature Cell Biology,https://openalex.org/V151741590,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-020-0461-8,225,234,22,2,1,232,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005253578,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-020-0461-8,journal-article,3005253578

Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources’ data might provide a better insight into the COVID-19 outbreak to manage the health crisis in each country and worldwide. Objective This study aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods Data were obtained from the Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. Results The linear regression model predicted the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 (SD 6.492). The most effective factors besides previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705).

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual.

Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term ‘shield immunity’ at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods— Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results— A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke.

Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family2. Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter2. Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics-the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin-that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins-essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth.

Cleavage of human and mouse RIPK1 after residues D324 and D325, respectively, by caspase-8 separates the RIPK1 kinase domain from the intermediate and death domains. The D325A mutation in mouse RIPK1 leads to embryonic lethality during mouse development2,3. However, the functional importance of blocking caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK1 on RIPK1 activation in humans is unknown. Here we identify two families with variants in RIPK1 (D324V and D324H) that lead to distinct symptoms of recurrent fevers and lymphadenopathy in an autosomal-dominant manner. Impaired cleavage of RIPK1 D324 variants by caspase-8 sensitized patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells to RIPK1 activation, apoptosis and necroptosis induced by TNF. The patients showed strong RIPK1-dependent activation of inflammatory signalling pathways and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with unaffected controls. Furthermore, we show that expression of the RIPK1 mutants D325V or D325H in mouse embryonic fibroblasts confers not only increased sensitivity to RIPK1 activation-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis, but also induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. By contrast, patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced expression of RIPK1 and downregulated production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in resistance to necroptosis and ferroptosis. Together, these data suggest that human non-cleavable RIPK1 variants promote activation of RIPK1, and lead to an autoinflammatory disease characterized by hypersensitivity to apoptosis and necroptosis and increased inflammatory response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as a compensatory mechanism to protect against several pro-death stimuli in fibroblasts.",2020-01-01,Nature,https://openalex.org/V137773608,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1830-y,109,114,577,7788,0,99,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995123617,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1830-y,journal-article,2995123617

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R 0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R 0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R 0 will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals.

The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. Methods A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. Results Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue. Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols.",2020-05-06,Journal of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery,https://openalex.org/V4210233012,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00425-6,,,49,1,1,90,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021068282,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00425-6,journal-article,3021068282

The irregular growth kinetics with which tumors grow leads to increased oxygen consumption and, in turn, hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia has been associated with poor clinical outcome, increased tumor heterogeneity, emergence of resistant clones and evasion of immune detection. Additionally, hypoxia-driven cell death pathways have traditionally been thought of as tolerogenic processes. However, as researchers working in the field of immunotherapy continue to investigate and unveil new types of immunogenic cell death (ICD), it has become clear that, in some instances, hypoxia may actually induce ICD within a tumor. In this review, we will discuss hypoxia-driven immune escape that drives poor prognostic outcomes, the ability of hypoxia to induce ICD and potential therapeutic targets amongst hypoxia pathways.",2020-04-16,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040992,992,992,9,4,1,80,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016364844,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040992,journal-article,3016364844

Perturbations in the microbiome during this period can contribute to development of immune-mediated diseases. We monitored microbiota maturation and associations with subsequent development of allergies in infants and children.We collected 145 stool samples, at 5, 13, 21, and 31 weeks postpartum (infants), and once at school age (6-11 years), from 44 children (49.3% girls, 24.8% born by cesarean delivery; all children except for 6 were breastfed for varying durations; median 4 weeks; interquartile range, 30-53 weeks). Microbiota were analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Children were followed through  years of age for development of atopic dermatitis; data on allergic sensitization and asthma were collected when children were school age.Diversity of fecal microbiota, assessed by Shannon index, did not differ significantly among children from  through 1 weeks after birth, but thereafter gradually increased to  and 31 weeks. Most bacteria within the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla were already present at  weeks after birth, whereas many bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum were acquired at later times in infancy. At school age, many new Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes bacterial taxa emerged. The largest increase in microbial diversity occurred after 31 weeks. Vaginal, compared with cesarean delivery, was most strongly associated with an enrichment of Bacteroides species at  weeks through 31 weeks. From 1 weeks onward, diet became the most important determinant of microbiota composition; cessation of breastfeeding, rather than solid food introduction, was associated with changes. For example, Bifidobacteria, staphylococci, and streptococci significantly decreased on cessation of breastfeeding, whereas bacteria within the Lachnospiraceae family (Pseudobutyrivibrio, Lachnobacterium, Roseburia, and Blautia) increased. When we adjusted for confounding factors, we found fecal microbiota composition to be associated with development of atopic dermatitis, allergic sensitization, and asthma. Members of the Lachnospiraceae family, as well as the genera Faecalibacterium and Dialister, were associated with a reduced risk of atopy.In a longitudinal study of fecal microbiota of children from  weeks through 6 to  years, we tracked changes in diversity and composition associated with the development of allergies and asthma.",2020-05-01,Gastroenterology,https://openalex.org/V143352558,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.01.024,1584,1596,158,6,1,77,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999444201,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.01.024,journal-article,2999444201

As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests.We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this.Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans.Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient's CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy.",2020-05-27,International Orthopaedics,https://openalex.org/V3756010,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04609-7,1539,1542,44,8,1,76,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032017599,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04609-7,journal-article,3032017599

Yet research suggests that this “work–family narrative” is incomplete: men also experience it and nevertheless advance; moreover, organizations’ effort to mitigate it through flexible work policies has not improved women’s advancement prospects and often hurts them. Hence this presumed remedy has the perverse effect of perpetuating the problem. Drawing on a case study of a professional service firm, we develop a multilevel theory to explain why organizations are caught in this conundrum. We present data suggesting that the work–family explanation has become a “hegemonic narrative”—a pervasive, status-quo-preserving story that prevails despite countervailing evidence. We then advance systems-psychodynamic theory to show how organizations use this narrative and attendant policies and practices as an unconscious “social defense” to help employees fend off anxieties raised by a 24/7 work culture and to protect organizationally powerful groups—in our case, men and the firm’s leaders—and in so doing, sustain workplace inequality. Due to the social defense, two orthodoxies remain unchallenged—the necessity of long work hours and the inescapability of women’s stalled advancement. The result is that women’s thin representation at senior levels remains in place.

The results reveal that, while data variety and velocity positively enhance firm innovation performance, data volume has no significant impact.

These therapies include soluble fibre (eg, ispaghula husk), antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators (including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or α-2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands). However, the relative efficacy of traditional treatments in patients with IBS is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of traditional therapies in patients with IBS to help inform clinical decisions.For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to week  of August 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials or supplementary data published up to Aug 18, 2019; and gastroenterology conference proceedings for study abstracts published between 200 and Aug 18, 2019. We included RCTs that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 1 years) with IBS of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. Only RCTs reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. The efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their P-score.Our search identified 586 references, of which 8 were screened for eligibility. 5 RCTs with data from 464 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 1 of these trials were at low risk of bias. Based on an endpoint of failure to achieve improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, peppermint oil capsules were ranked first for efficacy (RR 0·63, 95% CI 0·48-0·83, P-score 0·84) and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked second (0·66, 0·53-0·83, P-score 0·77). For failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, there were no significant differences between active treatments after direct or indirect comparisons. For failure to achieve improvement in abdominal pain at 4-12 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy (0·53, 0·34-0·83, P-score 0·87); however, this result was based on data from only four RCTs involving 9 patients. For failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal pain, none of the active treatments showed superior efficacy upon indirect comparison. Tricyclic antidepressants were more likely than placebo to lead to adverse events (1·59, 1·26-2·06, P-score 0·16).In this network meta-analysis of RCTs of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators for IBS, few of which were judged as being at a low risk of bias, peppermint oil was ranked first for efficacy when global symptoms were used as the outcome measure, and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy when abdominal pain was used as the outcome measure. However, because of the lack of methodological rigour of some RCTs analysed in our study, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty around these findings.

This scoping review aims to aggregate and report trends on how health professions educators harness the power of social media to engage physicians for the purposes of knowledge translation and education. Methods A scoping review was conducted by searching four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and ERIC) for publications emerging between 1990 to March 2018. Articles about social media usage for teaching physicians or their trainees for the purposes of knowledge translation or education were included. Relevant themes and trends were extracted and mapped for visualization and reporting, primarily using the Cook, Bordage, and Schmidt framework for types of educational studies (Description, Justification, and Clarification). Results There has been a steady increase in knowledge translation and education-related social media literature amongst physicians and their trainees since 1996. Prominent platforms include Twitter ( n = 157), blogs ( n = 104), Facebook ( n = 103), and podcasts ( n = 72). Dominant types of scholarship tended to be descriptive studies and innovation reports. Themes related to practice improvement, descriptions of the types of technology, and evidence-based practice were prominently featured.

Data after 2-yr follow-up are now available for analysis. Objective To determine if there was a difference in the AS failure rate in a 2-yr follow-up period among men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initial confirmatory biopsy (CBx) compared to those who did not. Design, setting, and participants This is the 2-yr post-CBx follow-up for the ASIST trial, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study for men with Gleason grade group (GG)  cancer eligible for AS. Patients were randomized to CBx with 12-core systematic sampling or MRI with systematic and targeted sampling. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Patients with GG ≤ 1 on CBx were followed for 2 yr and had MRI and biopsy at that time point. Patients failed AS if they were no longer under AS because of grade progression, clinical progression, subject choice, clinical judgment, treatment, or lost to follow-up. Clinically significant cancer (CSC) was defined as GG ≥ 2. Results and limitations In total, 25 men underwent CBx, 13 in the non-MRI and 12 in the MRI arm. After biopsy, 10 men in the non-MRI arm (76%) and 9 in the MRI arm (77%) continued AS. There were fewer men with AS failures in the MRI (19/98, 19%) compared to the non-MRI group (35/101, 35%; p =  0.017). At 2-yr biopsy there were fewer men with CSC in the MRI arm (9.9%, 8/81) than in the non-MRI arm (23%, 17/75; p =  0.048). Significant differences in AS failure rates were detected across the three centers in the MRI arm only (4.2% [2/48] vs 17% [4/24] vs 27% [7/26]; p =  0.019). Conclusions Baseline MRI before CBx during AS results in 50% fewer AS failures and less grade progression over 2 yr. The center where MRI and targeted biopsy is performed may influence AS failure rates. Patient summary The ASIST trial randomized 27 men on active surveillance with low-grade prostate cancer diagnosed within the last year to systematic biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with systematic and targeted biopsy. The initial report showed little benefit from targeted biopsy. However, after 2 yr of follow-up we found that baseline MRI before confirmatory biopsy resulted in 50% fewer failures of surveillance and less progression to higher-grade cancer. This confirms the value of MRI in men on surveillance.

In addition to the lack of investigations on surface roughness and residual stresses in selective laser melting of Inconel 718, process maps were developed for the selection of the best process parameters to achieve the desired values for the three parameters combined. Five laser powers, six scan speeds and three hatch spacings were chosen from the stable single tracks tests. Based on each property, a 99.5% density or a 2 μm surface roughness or the least surface tensile residual stress of 248 MPa were possible. However, no single process parameter combination was able to achieve good values for all three parameters. Prioritizing density and surface roughness, being crack initiators, over residual stresses for their effect on fatigue failure, it was found that 99.2% density and relatively low roughness of 3.5 μm are feasible at 320 W, 600 mm/s and 0.12 mm hatch spacing.

A master protocol refers to a single, overarching design developed to evaluate multiple hypotheses with the general goal of improving the efficiency of trial evaluation. One type of master protocol is the basket trial, in which a targeted therapy is evaluated for multiple diseases that share common molecular alterations or risk factors that may help predict whether the patients will respond to the given therapy. Another variant of a master protocol is the umbrella trial, in which multiple targeted therapies are evaluated for a single disease that is stratified into multiple subgroups based on different molecular or other predictive risk factors. Both designs follow the core principle of precision medicine-to tailor intervention strategies based on the patient's risk factor(s) that can help predict whether they will respond to a specific treatment. There have been increasing numbers of basket and umbrella trials, but they are still poorly understood.

Two configurations with direct heat exchange and indirect heat exchange using immersed heat exchangers are explored. A novel comparison is presented between both systems based on the solar fraction, which denotes the solar thermal energy contribution to the load. The effect of the storage volume on the solar fraction of the system is studied during a typical spring day while providing the hot water demands for a single-family residence, assuming a dispersed daily draw profile. The numerical results showed the crucial role of thermal stratification induced in the storage system with direct heat exchange. The storage system with direct heat exchange operates with 18–23% larger solar fraction than that with immersed coil heat exchangers. Adding PCM modules in the water tank with 50% volume fraction can yield around 40% potential reduction in the storage volume.

Two parallel, but overlapping, bodies of literature (i.e., ego depletion, mental fatigue) have examined this question. However, research to date has not merged these separate lines of inquiry to assess the overall magnitude of this effect. The present work reports the results of a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining carryover effects of cognitive exertion on physical performance. A systematic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus was conducted. Only randomized controlled trials involving healthy humans, a central executive task requiring cognitive exertion, an easier cognitive comparison task, and a physical performance task were included. A total of 7 studies provided 9 comparisons with 258 participants. Random effects meta-analysis showed a significant small-to-medium negative effect of prior cognitive exertion on physical performance (g = − 0.38 [95% CI − 0.46, − 0.31]). Subgroup analyses showed that cognitive tasks lasting < 30-min (g = − 0.45) and ≥ 30-min (g = − 0.30) have similar significant negative effects on subsequent physical performance. Prior cognitive exertion significantly impairs isometric resistance (g = − 0.57), motor (g = − 0.57), dynamic resistance (g = − 0.51), and aerobic performance (g = − 0.26), but the effects on maximal anaerobic performance are trivial and non-significant (g = 0.10). Studies employing between-subject designs showed a medium negative effect (g = − 0.65), whereas within-subject designs had a small negative effect (g = − 0.28). Findings demonstrate that cognitive exertion has a negative effect on subsequent physical performance that is not due to chance and suggest that previous meta-analysis results may have underestimated the overall effect.",2020-03-01,Sports Medicine,https://openalex.org/V137994755,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01204-8,497,529,50,3,0,54,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995111942,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01204-8,journal-article,2995111942

These reactions are domino processes comprising an aza-Diels-Alder (ADA) reaction followed by an extrusion of molecular nitrogen, yielding a dihydropyridazine. Analysis of the conceptual DFT (CDFT) indices showed an increase of the electrophilicity and a decrease of the nucleophilicity of tetrazines with an increase of the electron-withdrawing character of the substituent.

In response, there is increasing application of ACEs questionnaires in clinical practice and population health surveys. Such efforts are often justified as approaches to identify ACEs, components of trauma-informed care, and/or measures to determine prevalence within epidemiological research. Unfortunately, such measures are often used without evaluating the strengths and limitations of the measures themselves. One of the most commonly used ACEs questionnaires is a ten-question version (ACEs-10), that is composed of two clusters - one asking about different types of child maltreatment, and the other asking select questions about household challenges. Unfortunately, both this questionnaire and its derivatives have substantial drawbacks that warrant careful consideration about their use. Problems include limited item coverage, collapsing of items and response options, a simplistic scoring approach, and the lack of psychometric assessment. These deficiencies are inconsistent with the standards expected for use of measures in healthcare services and research. Given these deficiencies, we recommend that these limitations are addressed before further use of ACEs-10, and its derivatives, for either clinical or research purposes.",2020-03-01,Child Abuse & Neglect,https://openalex.org/V53055215,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104331,104331,104331,101,,1,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997994161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104331,journal-article,2997994161

It was hypothesized that the incidence of OA at long-term follow-up would be lower following anatomic compared to non-anatomic ACLR.A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting OA prevalence by radiographic classification scales at a minimum of 10 years following ACLR with autograft. Studies were categorized as anatomic if they met or exceeded a score of 8 according the Anatomic ACL Reconstruction Scoring Checklist (AARSC), while those with a score less than 8 were categorized as non-anatomic/non-specified. Secondary outcomes included graft failure and measures of knee stability (KT-1000, Pivot Shift) and functional outcomes [Lysholm, Tegner, subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores]. OA prevalence on all radiographic scales was recorded and adapted to a normalized scale.Twenty-six studies were included, of which  achieved a score of 8 on the AARSC. Using a normalized OA classification scale, 8 of 37 patients (23.2%) had diagnosed OA at a mean follow-up of 15. years after anatomic ACLR and 74 of 16 patients (43.9%) had OA at mean follow-up of 15. years after non-anatomic/non-specified ACLR. The AARSC scores were 9.2 ± 1. for anatomic ACLR and 5.1 ± 1. for non-anatomic/non-specified ACLR. Secondary outcomes were relatively similar between techniques but inconsistently reported.This study showed that anatomic ACLR, defined as an AARSC score ≥ 8, was associated with lower OA prevalence at long-term follow-up. Additional studies reporting long-term outcomes following anatomic ACLR are needed, as high-level studies of anatomic ACLR are lacking. The AARSC is a valuable resource in performing and evaluating anatomic ACLR.

This study was performed to quantitatively define the accuracy and reliability of information on YouTube regarding abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). <h3>Methods</h3> A systematic search of YouTube was conducted using multiple AAA-specific keywords. The default YouTube search setting of ""relevance"" was used to replicate an average search attempt, and the first 50 results from each keyword search were reviewed and analyzed by two independent reviewers. Descriptive characteristics, <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> Score, modified DISCERN score, Video Power Index, and a novel scoring system for the management of AAAs, the AAA-Specific Score (AAASS), were used to record data. Inter-rater agreement was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient estimates and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for intergroup comparisons. <h3>Results</h3> Fifty-one videos were included for analysis. The mean <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> Score, DISCERN, and AAASS values among videos were 1.74/4.00 (standard deviation [SD], 0.84), 2.37/5.00 (SD, 0.97), and 6.63/20.00 (SD, 3.23), respectively.

It is a narrative review in which we provide a qualitative synthesis of current evidence concerning clinical, molecular, neural and lifestyle correlates of cognitive impairment in BD across the lifespan (in premorbid, prodromal, early onset, post-onset, elderly cohorts). Results There is emerging evidence of empirical links between cognitive impairment and an increased inflammatory state, brain structural abnormalities and reduced neuroprotection in BD. However, evidence regarding the progressive nature of cognitive impairment is mixed, since consensus between different cross-sectional data is lacking and does not align to the outcomes of the limited longitudinal studies available. Increased recognition of cognitive heterogeneity in BD may help to explain some inconsistencies in the extant literature.

This study aimed to identify the principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts reported in different types of reviews of research partnerships in order to obtain a better understanding of the scope of the research partnership literature. Methods This review of reviews is part of a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to synthesise the research partnership literature with five conceptually linked literature reviews. The main research question was ‘What principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts are reported in different types of research partnership approaches?’. We included articles describing a literature review of research partnerships using a systematic search strategy. We used an adapted version of the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool to assess quality. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2018. Principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts were extracted from the included reviews and analysed using direct content analysis. Results We included 8 reviews using terms describing several research partnership approaches (e.g. community-based participatory research, participatory research, integrated knowledge translation). After the analyses, we synthesised 1 overarching principles and 1 overarching strategies and grouped them into one of the following subcategories: relationship between partners; co-production of knowledge; meaningful stakeholder engagement; capacity-building, support and resources; communication process; and ethical issues related to the collaborative research activities. Similarly, we synthesised 2 overarching outcomes and impacts on researchers, stakeholders, the community or society, and the research process. Conclusions This review of reviews is the first that presents overarching principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts of research partnerships.

Some of these pathways, such as those that produce antibiotics or bacteriocins, exert toxicity on nearby cells in a cell contact-independent manner. More recently, however, several mechanisms of interbacterial antagonism requiring cell-to-cell contact have been identified. This form of microbial competition is mediated by antibacterial protein toxins whose delivery to target bacteria uses protein secretion apparatuses embedded within the cell envelope of toxin-producing bacteria. In this review, we discuss recent work implicating the bacterial Type I, IV, VI, and VII secretion systems in the export of antibacterial ‘effector’ proteins that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism.",2020-05-01,Trends in Microbiology,https://openalex.org/V587692,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2020.01.003,387,400,28,5,0,42,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005809379,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2020.01.003,journal-article,3005809379

We investigated the association of adolescent obesity with incident T2D at early adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A nationwide, population-based study evaluated 1,462,362 adolescents (59% men, mean age 17.4 years) during 1996–2016. Data were linked to the Israeli National Diabetes Registry. Weight and height were measured at study entry. Cox proportional models were applied. RESULTS During 15,810,751 person-years, 2,177 people (69% men) developed T2D (mean age at diagnosis 2 years). There was an interaction among BMI, sex, and incident T2D (Pinteraction = 0.023). In a model adjusted for sociodemographic variables, the hazard ratios for diabetes diagnosis were 1.7 (95% CI 1.4–2.0), 2. (2.3–3.5), 5.8 (4.9–6.9), 13.4 (11.5–15.7), and 25. (21.0–31.6) among men in the 50th–74th percentile, 75th–84th percentile, overweight, mild obesity, and severe obesity groups, respectively, and 2. (1.6–2.9), 3.4 (2.5–4.6), 10.6 (8.3–13.6), 21.1 (16.0–27.8), and 44.7 (32.4–61.5), respectively, in women. An inverse graded relationship was observed between baseline BMI and mean age of T2D diagnosis: 27.8 and 25. years among men and women with severe obesity, respectively, and 29.5 and 28.5 years among low-normal BMI (5th–49th percentile; reference), respectively. The projected fractions of adult-onset T2D that were attributed to high BMI (≥85th percentile) at adolescence were 56.9% (53.8–59.9%) and 61.1% (56.8–65.2%) in men and women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Severe obesity significantly increases the risk for incidence of T2D in early adulthood in both sexes.

Seventy-nine randomized controlled trials (RCT) including 11,002 participants with a diagnosis of GAD were included in a meta-analysis that tested the efficacy of psychotherapies or medications for GAD. Psychotherapy showed a medium to large effect size (g = 0.76) and medication showed a small effect size (g = 0.38) on GAD outcomes. Psychotherapy also showed a medium effect on depression outcomes (g = 0.64) as did medications (g = 0.59). Younger age was associated with a larger effect size for psychotherapy (p < 0.05). There was evidence of publication bias in psychotherapy studies. This analysis found a medium to large effect for empirically supported psychotherapy interventions on GAD outcomes and a small effect for medications on GAD outcomes. Both groups showed a medium effect on depression outcomes. Because medication studies had more placebo control conditions than inactive conditions compared to psychotherapy studies, effect sizes between the domains should not be compared directly.

Mesoporous materials offer an attractive route for generating efficient electrocatalysts with high mass transport capabilities. Herein, we report an efficient hard templating pathway to design and synthesize three-dimensional (3-D) mesoporous ternary nickel iron nitride (Ni3FeN). The as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows good OER performance in an alkaline solution with low overpotential (25 mV) and a small Tafel slope (5 mV dec −1 ), giving superior performance to IrO 2 and RuO 2 catalysts. The highly active contact area, the hierarchical porosity, and the synergistic effect of bimetal atoms contributed to the improved electrocatalytic performance toward OER. In a practical rechargeable Zn–air battery, mesoporous Ni  FeN is also shown to deliver a lower charging voltage and longer lifetime than RuO 2 .

New strategies are urgently needed to overcome this threat. Using a cell-based screen of ~45,000 diverse synthetic compounds, we discovered a potent bioactive, MAC-545496, that reverses β-lactam resistance in the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain. MAC-545496 could also serve as an antivirulence agent alone; it attenuates MRSA virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae. MAC-545496 inhibits biofilm formation and abrogates intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistic characterization revealed MAC-545496 to be a nanomolar inhibitor of GraR, a regulator that responds to cell-envelope stress and is an important virulence factor and determinant of antibiotic resistance. The small molecule discovered herein is an inhibitor of GraR function. MAC-545496 has value as a research tool to probe the GraXRS regulatory system and as an antibacterial lead series of a mechanism to combat drug-resistant Staphylococcal infections.

This critical interpretive synthesis analyzes the appropriateness of wealth indices for measuring social health inequalities and provides an overview of alternative methods to calculate wealth indices using data captured in standardized household surveys. Our aggregation of all published associations of wealth indices indicates a mean Spearman’s rho of 0.4 and 0.5 with income and consumption, respectively. Context-specific factors such as country development level may affect the concordance of health and educational outcomes with wealth indices and urban–rural disparities can be more pronounced using wealth indices compared to income or consumption. Synthesis of potential future uses of wealth indices suggests that it is possible to quantify wealth inequality using household assets, that the index can be used to study SES across national boundaries, and that technological innovations may soon change how asset wealth is measured. Finally, a review of alternative approaches to constructing household asset indices suggests lack of evidence of superiority for count measures, item response theory, and Mokken scale analysis, but points to evidence-based advantages for multiple correspondence analysis, polychoric PCA and predicted income. In sum, wealth indices are an equally valid, but distinct measure of household SES from income and consumption measures, and more research is needed into their potential applications for international health inequality measurement.",2020-02-01,Social Indicators Research,https://openalex.org/V112952035,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-019-02187-9,1,46,148,1,1,38,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972661930,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-019-02187-9,journal-article,2972661930

We sought to characterize and compare the accuracy of physical examination, chest radiography, endotracheal aspirate (ETA), bronchoscopic sampling cultures (protected specimen brush [PSB] and bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]), and CPIS > 6 to diagnose VAP. We searched six databases from inception through September 201 and selected English-language studies investigating accuracy of any of the above tests for VAP diagnosis. Reference standard was histopathological analysis. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We included 2 studies (1639 patients). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of physical examination findings for VAP were poor: fever (66.4% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.7–85.0], 53.9% [95% CI 34.5–72.2]) and purulent secretions (77.0% [95% CI 64.7–85.9], 39.0% [95% CI 25.8–54.0]).

Emerging evidence indicates that post-SCI inflammation is severe but the role of reactive astrogliosis not well understood given its implication in ongoing inflammation as damaging or neuroprotective. We have completed an extensive systematic study with MRI, histopathology, proteomics and ELISA analyses designed to further define the severe protracted and damaging inflammation after SCI in a rat model. We have identified  distinct phases of SCI: acute (first  days), inflammatory (starting day 3) and resolution (>3 months) in 16 weeks follow up. Actively phagocytizing, CD68+/CD163- macrophages infiltrate myelin-rich necrotic areas converting them into cavities of injury (COI) when deep in the spinal cord. Alternatively, superficial SCI areas are infiltrated by granulomatous tissue, or arachnoiditis where glial cells are obliterated. In the COI, CD68+/CD163- macrophage numbers reach a maximum in the first  weeks and then decline. Myelin phagocytosis is present at 16 weeks indicating ongoing inflammatory damage. The COI and arachnoiditis are defined by a wall of progressively hypertrophied astrocytes. MR imaging indicates persistent spinal cord edema that is linked to the severity of inflammation. Microhemorrhages in the spinal cord around the lesion are eliminated, presumably by reactive astrocytes within the first week post-injury. Acutely increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases decrease and anti-inflammatory cytokines increase in later phases.

Single administration of bleomycin directly to the lungs of mice is a widely used experimental model for studying pulmonary fibrogenesis and evaluating the effect of therapeutic antifibrotic strategies. The model works by inducing an early inflammatory phase, which transitions into fibrosis after 5–7 days. This initial inflammation makes therapeutic timing crucial. To accurately assess antifibrotic efficacy, the intervention should inhibit fibrosis without impacting early inflammation. Studies published between 200 and 201 using the bleomycin model to investigate pulmonary fibrosis were retrieved from PubMed, and study characteristics were analysed. Intervention-based studies were classified as either preventative (starting &lt;7 days after bleomycin installation) or therapeutic (&gt;7 days). In addition, studies were cross-referenced with current major clinical trials to assess the availability of preclinical rationale. A total of 97 publications were evaluated. 72 investigated potential therapies, of which 443 (61.0%) were solely preventative, 16 (22.9%) were solely therapeutic and 10 (14.5%) were both. Of the 443 preventative studies, only 7 (15.8%) characterised inflammation during the model's early inflammatory phase. In the reported 1 IPF clinical trials investigating  compounds/combinations, only  (26.9%) interventions had any preclinical data on bleomycin available on PubMed.

In this study, we leverage the valence theory perspective to investigate the role of positive and negative valence factors on the impact of bigness of data on big data analytics usage within firms. The research model is validated empirically from 140 IT managers and data analysts using survey data. The results confirm the impact of bigness of data on both negative valence (i.e., data security concern and task complexity), and positive valence (i.e., data accessibility and data diagnosticity) factors. In addition, findings show that data security concern is not a critical factor in using big data analytics. The results also show that, interestingly, at different levels of data security concern, task complexity, data accessibility, and data diagnosticity, the impact of bigness of data on big data analytics use will be varied.

However, metagenomic sequencing is needed to identify the genetic content and functional potential of a community. Metagenomics is challenging in samples dominated by host DNA, such as those from the skin, tissue and respiratory tract. Here, we combine advances in amplicon and metagenomic sequencing with culture-enriched molecular profiling to study the human microbiota. Using the cystic fibrosis lung as an example, we cultured an average of 82.13% of the operational taxonomic units representing 99.3% of the relative abundance identified in direct sequencing of sputum samples; importantly, culture enrichment identified 63.3% more operational taxonomic units than direct sequencing. We developed the PLate Coverage Algorithm (PLCA) to determine a representative subset of culture plates on which to conduct culture-enriched metagenomics, resulting in the recovery of greater taxonomic diversity—including of low-abundance taxa—with better metagenome-assembled genomes, longer contigs and better functional annotations when compared to culture-independent methods. The PLCA is also applied as a proof of principle to a previously published gut microbiota dataset. Culture-enriched molecular profiling can be used to better understand the role of the human microbiota in health and disease. The PLate Coverage Algorithm (PLCA) determines the culture plates required for culture-enriched metagenomics and enables the recovery of greater taxonomic diversity, better quality metagenome-assembled genomes and improved functional annotations compared to metagenomics alone, indicating its utility for other microbiomes, especially those dominated by host DNA.",2020-01-20,Nature microbiology,https://openalex.org/V2764926557,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0643-y,379,390,5,2,1,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000358964,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0643-y,journal-article,3000358964

In recent years, with emergence and development of machine learning- and sequencing-driven technologies, the prediction of neuromuscular disorders could be made on the basis of gene expression for accurate diagnosis of disease. The intent is to correctly distinguish the patients affected from neuromuscular disorder from the healthy one with the help of various classification methods used in machine learning. In this paper, we proposed a novel feature selection method which applies deep learning method for grouping the outputs generated through various classifiers. The feature selection is performed on the basis of integrated Bhattacharya coefficient and genetic algorithm (GA) where fitness is computed on the basis of ensemble outputs of various classifiers which is performed using deep learning methods. The Bhattacharya coefficient computed the most effective gene subset; then, the most discriminative gene subset will be formulated using GA. The proposed integrated deep learning multi-model ensemble method was applied on two commercially available neuromuscular disorder datasets.

However, while such approaches may well be more portable, realistic, or satisfying than traditional photographic presentations, it is less clear that they have any superiority in terms of student learning. In this study, it was hypothesized that virtual and mixed reality presentations of pelvic anatomy will have an advantage over two-dimensional (2D) presentations and perform approximately equal to physical models and that this advantage over 2D presentations will be reduced when stereopsis is decreased by covering the non-dominant eye. Groups of 20 undergraduate students learned pelvic anatomy under seven conditions: physical model with and without stereo vision, mixed reality with and without stereo vision, virtual reality with and without stereo vision, and key views on a computer monitor. All were tested with a cadaveric pelvis and a 15-item, short-answer recognition test. Compared to the key views, the physical model had a 70% increase in accuracy in structure identification; the virtual reality a 25% increase, and the mixed reality a non-significant 2.5% change. Blocking stereopsis reduced performance on the physical model by 15%, on virtual reality by 60%, but by only 2.5% on the mixed reality technology.

While elevations in serum phosphorus contribute to VC, we provide evidence here for a major role of oxidative stress (OS) in VC pathogenesis without an apparent increase in serum phosphorus in early CKD. In a rat model for stage  CKD (CKD5), we observed 1) robust increases of VC and OS, 2) significant reductions of smooth muscle 2 alpha (SM22α) and calponin, and 3) upregulations in Runt-related transcription factor  (RUNX2) and collagen I in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Inhibition of OS using MnTMPyP dramatically reduced these events without normalization of hyperphosphatemia. In CKD5 patients with VC (n = 11) but not in those without VC (n = 13), OS was significantly elevated. While the serum levels of calcium and phosphate were not altered in the animal model for early stage CKD (ECKD), OS, VC, SM22α, calponin, RUNX2, collagen I and NADPH oxidase  (NOX1) in VSMCs were all significantly changed. More importantly, serum (5%) derived from patients with ECKD (n = 30) or CKD5 (n = 30) induced SM22α and calponin downregulation, and RUNX2, collagen I, NOX1 upregulation along with a robust elevation of OS and calcium deposition in primary rat VSMCs. These alterations were all reduced by MnTMPyP, ML171 (a NOX1 inhibitor), and U0126 (an inhibitor of Erk signaling). Collectively, we provide a comprehensive set of evidence supporting an important role of OS in promoting VC development in CKD patients (particularly in those with ECKD); this was at least in part through induction of osteoblastic transition in VSMCs which may involve the Erk singling. Our research thus suggests that reductions in OS may prevent VC in CKD patients.",2020-01-01,Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology,https://openalex.org/V111163638,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.006,256,268,138,,1,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997481362,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.006,journal-article,2997481362

However, the optimal intensity and underlying mechanism are unclear. This community-based study examined the effect of aerobic exercise intensity on memory and general cognitive abilities. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was examined as a potential mechanism. Sixty-four sedentary older adults participated in  of  groups: (i) high-intensity interval training (HIIT); (ii) moderate continuous training (MCT); or (iii) stretching control (CON). Prior to and following the intervention, high-interference memory was assessed using a Mnemonic Similarity task and executive functions were assessed using Go Nogo and Flanker tasks. HIIT led to the greatest memory performance compared with MCT and CON (F [2,55] = 6.04, p = 0.004) and greater improvements in memory correlated with greater increases in fitness (r s (46) = 0.27, p = 0.03). Exercise intensity seemed to matter less for executive functioning, as positive trends were observed for both HIIT and MCT. No significant differences in BDNF were found between groups. Overall, these results suggest that aerobic exercise may enhance memory in older adults, with the potential for higher intensity exercise to yield the greatest benefit. While our findings suggest that BDNF does not regulate these adaptations, the mechanisms remain to be determined.

Hydrologic analysis, however, has been shown to be affected by climate change. In response to the modified pattern of rainfall, stormwater management practices, such as Low Impact Developments (LIDs), need to be applied to successfully respond to the possible future climatic conditions, while meeting the performance criteria based on the current state of the watershed. In this study, a simulation-optimization framework is proposed to find the optimal design of LIDs (type, location, and area) under climate change. Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is utilized to simulate the rainfall-runoff process. This model is linked with a single-objective optimization routine formulated by Genetic Algorithm (GA) that minimizes runoff volume and the costs associated with the LIDs’ design. To investigate how climate change might affect the future watershed runoff, rainfall projections by several General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used. Change factor methodology is applied to downscale GCMs’ outputs. The framework is applied to the Velenjak watershed, located in the northeastern Tehran, Iran. Results show that the optimization algorithm provides optimal solutions for LIDs’ design under different extreme climate scenarios by allocating an average of 0.23% of the watershed area (20% of the maximum potential area considered for LIDs’ implementation), which results in a runoff volume reduction of up to 18%. The results also indicate that the optimal design of LIDs based on the current condition satisfies the watershed management goals and expectations in a future subjected to climate change impacts.

Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA.MethodWe use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches—Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning.ResultsOur findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Sweden’s forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middle—the trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases.ConclusionWe show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden).

An international consensus group of experts was convened to collaboratively advance toward consensus opinions regarding the best available evidence on operative vs. non-operative treatment for ACL injury. The purpose of this study is to report the consensus statements on operative vs. non-operative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 1 countries, were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organizing Committee and Session Chairs for the three working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided the initial agreement and comments on the statement via an online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty percent agreement was defined a-priori as consensus. A total of 1 of 1 statements on operative v. non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached the consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated.

Second-line options include oral cephalosporins such as cephalexin or cefixime, fluoroquinolones and β-lactams, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Current treatment options for UTIs due to AmpC- β -lactamase-producing Enterobacteriales include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, fluoroquinolones, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems. Treatment oral options for UTIs due to ESBLs-E coli include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, finafloxacin, and sitafloxacin while pivmecillinam, fosfomycin, finafloxacin, and sitafloxacin are treatment oral options for ESBLs- Klebsiella pneumoniae. Parenteral treatment options for UTIs due to ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriales include piperacillin-tazobactam (for ESBL-E coli only), carbapenems including meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam, and sulopenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, cefiderocol, fosfomycin, sitafloxacin, and finafloxacin. Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam, colistin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam, aztreonam and amoxicillin-clavulanate, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, cefiderocol, tigecycline are treatment options for UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales (CRE). Treatment options for UTIs caused by multidrug resistant (MDR)-Pseudomonas spp. include fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems including imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, meropenem, and fosfomycin, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, aminoglycosides including plazomicin, aztreonam and ceftazidime-avibactam, cefiderocol, and colistin.

To purpose of this review was to analyze available evidence on the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers, clinical presentation, and outcomes in patients with acute, subacute and chronic non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). Methods A search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Amed databases. Studies which measured levels of inflammatory biomarkers in participants with NSLBP were included. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, full-texts, and extracted data from included studies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Level of evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE approach for prognostic studies. Results Seven primary studies were included in this review. All results assessed using the modified GRADE demonstrated low to very low quality evidence given the small number of studies and small sample. Three studies examined C-reactive protein (CRP), one of which found significantly higher CRP levels in an acute NSLBP group than in controls and an association between high pain intensity and elevated CRP. Three studies examined tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), two of which found elevated TNF-α in chronic NSLBP participants compared to controls. Two studies examined interleukin  (IL-6), none of which found a significant difference in IL-6 levels between NSLBP groups and controls. Two studies examined interleukin  beta (IL-β), none of which found a significant difference in IL-β levels between NSLBP groups and controls.

We defined 'brief' as a protocol lasting ≤1 min including warm-up, cool-down and recovery, and involving a total of ≤ min of 'vigorous' exercise, which was classified as meeting or exceeding the lower end of the range for this relative intensity as per the criteria from the American College of Sports Medicine. The physiological mechanisms responsible for the increase in CRF, as measured by maximal oxygen update ( V O 2 max ), after brief vigorous exercise are unclear and likely depend on various factors including the specific nature of the intervention as well as the time course of the response. Limited available evidence suggests the potential for an increased oxygen extraction by active muscle (i.e. greater arterio-venous oxygen difference), since an increase in V O 2 max has been reported after several weeks of brief vigorous exercise despite no measurable change in cardiac output. Emerging evidence indicates that brief vigorous exercise can improve glycaemic control, suggesting that this type of exercise could potentially play a role in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. The acute response is not well characterized but several studies have shown that several weeks of vigorous exercise improves estimates of insulin sensitivity as determined by various methods including by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp.

This paper documents a process for converting coke oven gas (COG) and blast furnace gas (BFG) from steel refineries into methanol. Specifically, we propose the use of blast furnace gas (BFG) as an additional carbon source. The high CO 2 and CO content of BFG make it a good carbon resource. In the proposed process, CO 2 is recovered from the BFG and blended with H 2 O, H 2 , and CH  -rich COG to reform methane. Optimized amounts of H 2 O and CO 2 are used to adjust the (H 2 – CO  )/(CO + CO 2 ) molar ratio in order to maximize the amount of methanol that is produced. In addition, the desulphurization process was modified to enable the removal of sulfur compounds, especially thiophene, from the COG. The process design and simulation results reported herein were then used to determine any potential environmental and economic benefits. This research is based on off-gas conditions provided by ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AMD), Hamilton, Ontario. In order to determine which conditions are most desirable for this retrofit strategy, potential greenhouse gas reduction and economic benefits were analyzed. In particular, this analysis focused on the heating utility chosen for methane reformation prior to methanol synthesis. To this end, COG, BFG, and natural gas (NG) were compared. The results showed that using BFG/NG as a heating utility can produce greater economic gains, and that synthesizing COG + BFG to methanol results in greater economic and environmental gains than solely producing electricity (the status quo). Compared to current operating procedures, the proposed process could potentially increase net present values by up to $54 million. The carbon efficiency achieved was up to 72%. An additional 0.73 kg of CO 2 from BFG is needed for every  kg of MeOH produced. About 52% of feedstock energy is converted to MeOH, with another 33% recovered in the form of utilities. The exergy efficiency of the recommended version of the system is about 61%. The business case for converting CO 2 into methanol highly depends on the local electricity grid carbon intensity. For Ontario, it can reduce direct CO 2 emissions by 2 ktonne per year, and fix up to 2 ktonne CO 2 into methanol per year. In addition, analyses of location effects, CO 2 taxes, electricity prices, electricity carbon intensity, methanol prices, and income taxes indicated that MeOH production is highly recommended for Ontario, Mexico, the USA, and China applications. For USA, build MeOH plant is recommended for Finland, whether to do this retrofit or not is inconclusive. For Finland, the results are inconclusive, other strategies may be equally suitable.

We performed a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis comparing DBT, combined DBT and digital mammography (DM), and DM alone for breast cancer detection in average-risk women. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until September 2018. Comparative design studies reporting on the diagnostic accuracy of DBT and/or DM for breast cancer detection were included. Demographic, methodologic, and diagnostic accuracy data were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. Accuracy metrics were pooled using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of multiple covariates was assessed using meta-regression. PROSPERO ID: CRD 42018111287. Thirty-eight studies reporting on 488,099 patients (13,923 with breast cancer) were included. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias. DBT alone, combined DBT and DM, and DM alone demonstrated sensitivities of 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83–92), 88% (CI 83–92), and 79% (CI 75–82), as well as specificities of 84% (CI 76–89), 81% (CI 73–88), and 79% (CI 71–85), respectively. The greater sensitivities of DBT alone and combined DBT and DM compared to DM alone were preserved in the combined meta-regression models accounting for other covariates (p = 0.003–0.006). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between DBT alone and combined DBT and DM was identified (p = 0.175–0.581). DBT is more sensitive than DM, while the addition of DM to DBT provides no additional diagnostic benefit. Consideration of these findings in breast cancer imaging guidelines is recommended. • Digital breast tomosynthesis with or without additional digital mammography is more sensitive in detecting breast cancer than digital mammography alone in women at average risk for breast cancer.

The implications are significant as medical educators decide on how best to use limited resources to prepare trainees for safe medical practice. This myth-busting critical review cautions against the proliferation of curricular interventions based on the acquisition of generalisable skills. Structure This paper begins by examining the recent history of general thinking skills, as defined by research in cognitive psychology and medical education. We describe three distinct epochs: (a) the Renaissance, which marked the beginning of cognitive psychology as a discipline in the 1960s and 1970s and was paralleled by educational reforms in medical education focused on problem solving and problem-based learning; (b) the Enlightenment, when an accumulation of evidence in psychology and in medical education cast doubt on the assumption of general reasoning or problem-solving skill and shifted the focus to consideration of the role of knowledge in expert clinical performance; and (c) the Counter-Enlightenment, in the current time, when the notion of general thinking skills has reappeared under different guises, but the fundamental problems related to lack of generality of skills and centrality of knowledge remain.

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, and grey literature up to March 2019. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We included randomised controlled trials that compared gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis with PPIs, H2RAs, or sucralfate versus one another or placebo or no prophylaxis in adult critically ill patients. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A parallel guideline committee ( BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided critical oversight of the systematic review, including identifying outcomes important to patients. We performed random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. When results differed between low risk and high risk of bias studies, we used the former as best estimates. Results Seventy two trials including 1 66 patients proved eligible. For patients at highest risk (&gt;8%) or high risk (4-8%) of bleeding, both PPIs and H2RAs probably reduce clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding compared with placebo or no prophylaxis (odds ratio for PPIs 0.6 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.89), 3.3% fewer for highest risk and 2.3% fewer for high risk patients, moderate certainty; odds ratio for H2RAs 0.4 (0.2 to 0.79), 4.6% fewer for highest risk and 3.1% fewer for high risk patients, moderate certainty). Both may increase the risk of pneumonia compared with no prophylaxis (odds ratio for PPIs 1.3 (0.9 to 2.10), 5.0% more, low certainty; odds ratio for H2RAs 1.2 (0.8 to 1.85), 3.4% more, low certainty). It is likely that neither affect mortality (PPIs 1.0 (0.9 to 1.28), 1.3% more, moderate certainty; H2RAs 0.9 (0.7 to 1.19), 0.9% fewer, moderate certainty). Otherwise, results provided no support for any affect on mortality, Clostridium difficile infection, length of intensive care stay, length of hospital stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation (varying certainty of evidence). Conclusions For higher risk critically ill patients, PPIs and H2RAs likely result in important reductions in gastrointestinal bleeding compared with no prophylaxis; for patients at low risk, the reduction in bleeding may be unimportant. Both PPIs and H2RAs may result in important increases in pneumonia. Variable quality evidence suggested no important effects of interventions on mortality or other in-hospital morbidity outcomes.

Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of protein quality on feeding- and feeding plus RE–induced increases of acute and longer-term MPS after ingestion of whey protein (WP) and collagen protein (CP). Methods In a double-blind parallel-group design, 2 healthy older women (mean ± SD age: 6 ±  y, n = 11/group) were randomly assigned to consume a 30-g supplement of either WP or CP twice daily for  d. Participants performed unilateral RE twice during the 6-d period to determine the acute (via [13C6]-phenylalanine infusion) and longer-term (ingestion of deuterated water) MPS responses, the primary outcome measures. Results Acutely, WP increased MPS by a mean ± SD 0.01 ± 0.008%/h in the feeding-only leg (Rest) and 0.03 ± 0.012%/h in the feeding plus exercise leg (Exercise) (both P &amp;lt; 0.01), whereas CP increased MPS only in Exercise (0.01 ± 0.013%/h) (P &amp;lt; 0.01) and MPS was greater in WP than CP in both the Rest and Exercise legs (P = 0.02). Longer-term MPS increased by 0.06 ± 0.059%/d in Rest and 0.17 ± 0.104%/d in Exercise (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) with WP; however, MPS was not significantly elevated above baseline in Rest (0.01 ± 0.042%/d) or Exercise (0.02 ± 0.034%/d) with CP. Longer-term MPS was greater in WP than in CP in both Rest and Exercise (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Supplementation with WP elicited greater increases in both acute and longer-term MPS than CP supplementation, which is suggestive that WP is a more effective supplement to support skeletal muscle retention in older women than CP.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of ERAS after gastric cancer surgery. Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PubMed was searched from database inception to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ERAS versus standard care in gastric cancer surgery were included. Outcomes included the postoperative length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, time to first flatus, defecation, oral intake, and ambulation after surgery, and complications. Pooled estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The GRADE approach assessed overall quality of evidence. 1 RCTs involving 178 patients were included. ERAS significantly reduced the LOS (Mean Difference (MD) -1.78 days, 95%CI -2.17 to -1.40, P < 0.0001), reduced hospital costs (MD -65 U S. dollars, 95%CI -84 to -460, P < 0.0001), and reduced time to first flatus, defecation, ambulation, and oral intake. ERAS had significantly lower rates of pulmonary infections (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.48, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.82, P = 0.007), but not surgical site infections, anastomotic leaks, and postoperative complications. However, ERAS significantly increased readmissions (RR 2.43, 95%CI 1.09 to 5.43, P = 0.03). The quality of evidence was low to moderate for all outcomes. Implementation of an ERAS protocol may reduce LOS, costs, and time to return of function after gastric cancer surgery compared to conventional recovery.

An important risk factor for disease severity is obesity. Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review examining weight loss and dietary interventions, in HS. Our secondary objective was to examine nutritional supplements in HS.A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database. We included all study types in adults (>18 years), with a minimum sample size of 5, examining the effects of any dietary or weight loss intervention on HS severity. Two authors screened n = 127 articles of which  met inclusion criteria. All included studies were observational and all interventions were associated with various measures of decreased HS severity. Patient-controlled weight loss and bariatric surgery were associated with HS regression, though a subset of patients with significant increase in panniculi experienced exacerbations and required excision of excess skin. Diets demonstrating benefit eliminated dairy and brewer's yeast. Nutritional supplements including zinc gluconate, vitamin D, and riboflavin had a suppressive, rather than curative, effect on HS lesions in single studies.

While all other disease entities seek to restore function to a normal level, PwH are restricted to factor nadirs still equivalent to mild or moderate disease, resulting in continued risk of bleeding. A new treatment paradigm is needed based on the defined needs of PwH. A treatment model was developed by a panel of haemophilia providers, patient advocates and health economists to establish specific treatment milestones and targeted outcomes. The panel defined a series of treatment milestones to characterize the activity and outcomes linked to level of factor deficiency correction. All agreed that the ultimate goal should be 'functional cure' and 'health equity'. Seven levels to achieving a functional cure were identified, (a) Sustain life; (b) Minimal joint impairment; (c) Freedom from any spontaneous bleeds; (d) Attainment of 'normal' mobility; (e) Able to sustain minor trauma without additional intervention; (f) Ability to sustain major surgery or trauma; and (g) Normal haemostasis. A parallel set of patient-reported outcomes to achieve health equity was identified. These guidelines are now comparable with other disorders where the goal is to replace missing proteins to attain normal activity levels.

Assessing photosynthetic phenology remotely is difficult for evergreen conifers as they remain green year-round. Carotenoid-based vegetation indices such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI) are promising tools to remotely track the invisible phenology of photosynthesis by assessing carotenoid pigment dynamics. PRI, CCI and the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV ) index may act as proxies of photosynthetic efficiency (ɛ), an important parameter in light-use efficiency models, or direct proxies of photosynthesis. To understand the physiological mechanisms reflected by PRI and CCI and the ability of vegetation indices to act as proxies of photosynthetic activity for estimating GPP, we measured leaf pigment composition, PRI, CCI, NIRV and photosynthetic activity at the leaf and canopy scales over 2 years in an evergreen and mixed deciduous forest. PRI and CCI captured the large seasonal carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio changes and good relationships were observed between PRI-ɛ and CCI-photosynthesis and NIRV -photosynthesis.

The capacity for aerobic thermogenesis can be a critical determinant of survival for small mammals at high altitude, but the physiological mechanisms underlying the evolution of this performance trait remain unresolved. We examined this issue by comparing high-altitude deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ) with low-altitude deer mice and white-footed mice ( P. leucopus ). Mice were bred in captivity and adults were acclimated to each of four treatments: warm (25°C) normoxia, warm hypoxia (1 kPa O 2 ), cold (5°C) normoxia or cold hypoxia. Acclimation to hypoxia and/or cold increased thermogenic capacity in deer mice, but hypoxia acclimation led to much greater increases in thermogenic capacity in highlanders than in lowlanders. The high thermogenic capacity of highlanders was associated with increases in pulmonary O 2 extraction, arterial O 2 saturation, cardiac output and arterial–venous O 2 difference. Mechanisms underlying the evolution of enhanced thermogenic capacity in highlanders were partially distinct from those underlying the ancestral acclimation responses of lowlanders.

It is important to understand and quantify how forest carbon fluxes respond to heat and drought stress. In this study, we developed a series of daily indices of sensitivity to heat and drought stress as indicated by air temperature (Ta ) and evaporative fraction (EF). Using normalized daily carbon fluxes from the FLUXNET Network for 34 forest sites in North America, the seasonal pattern of sensitivities of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) in response to Ta and EF anomalies were compared for different forest types. The results showed that warm temperatures in spring had a positive effect on NEP in conifer forests but a negative impact in deciduous forests. GEP in conifer forests increased with higher temperature anomalies in spring but decreased in summer. The drought-induced decrease in NEP, which mostly occurred in the deciduous forests, was mostly driven by the reduction in GEP. In conifer forests, drought had a similar dampening effect on both GEP and RE, therefore leading to a neutral NEP response. The NEP sensitivity to Ta anomalies increased with increasing mean annual temperature. Drier sites were less sensitive to drought stress in summer. Natural forests with older stand age tended to be more resilient to the climate stresses compared to managed younger forests. The results of the Classification and Regression Tree analysis showed that seasons and ecosystem productivity were the most powerful variables in explaining the variation of forest sensitivity to heat and drought stress. Our results implied that the magnitude and direction of carbon flux changes in response to climate extremes are highly dependent on the seasonal dynamics of forests and the timing of the climate extremes.",2020-02-01,Global Change Biology,https://openalex.org/V74970393,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14843,901,918,26,2,1,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2973395614,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14843,journal-article,2973395614

These drawbacks prevent their applications by the general public or under resource-limited settings. Therefore, developing rapid, accurate, inexpensive and sensitive methods for pathogenic bacterial detection remains a major research focus in the global research community. In recent years, functional nucleic acids, particularly DNA aptamers and DNAzymes, have been increasingly examined as the recognition element for bacterial biomarkers and whole bacterial cells. Significant efforts have also been made to utilize these affinity probes for the design of simple and cost-effective biosensors for bacterial detection. This review highlights the key achievements in this area, identifies important challenges, and provides thoughts on future directions. • DNA aptamers and DNAzymes are reliable components of bacterial biosensors. • Functional DNA can possess high affinity and specificity towards target bacteria. • Target ligands can be found through an in vitro selection process. • Many aptamers and DNAzymes are translated into sensors used in complex matrices. • Competitive limits of detection can be improved through amplification techniques.",2020-03-01,Trends in Analytical Chemistry,https://openalex.org/V64920681,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.115785,115785,115785,124,,0,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996794967,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.115785,journal-article,2996794967

Given the important contribution of caregiver emotion socialization, parenting programs targeting these socialization practices represent an effective method of preventative intervention for childhood difficulties with emotion regulation. This review examines emotion socialization parenting programs that target the development of emotion regulation in young children aged 0-6. Through a systematic search of multiple databases, 111 articles were retrieved for title, abstract, and full-text screening. After screening, 1 articles remained and were summarized using a narrative approach. Herein, we provide an overview of  main intervention frameworks: Tuning in to Kids (TIK), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), and Emotion Enhanced Triple P (EETP). Overall, these emotion socialization programs have demonstrated efficacy in their ability to improve parenting behaviors related to the coaching of young children's emotion regulation; however, there has been limited examination of their effectiveness in promoting children's emotion regulation. Future research is required to address this limitation, with rigorous parenting intervention studies incorporating valid assessments of children's emotion regulation in order to promote children's development of adaptive emotion regulation.

This is particularly of interest for cancer management due to the importance of early diagnostics as well as the critical need for frequent treatment monitoring. We have reviewed clinically-relevant electrochemical biosensors that have been developed over the past five years for the analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a model protein target for prostate cancer management. We have critically evaluated the key performance metrics of these biosensors for clinical translation: limit-of-detection, linear range, and recovery rate in bodily fluids. These PSA electrochemical biosensors can be broadly categorized as sandwich assays, direct detection assays, and indirect detection assays. Among these, indirect detection assays deliver the lowest limit-of-detection.

Symptomatic response to antidepressants can vary depending on differences between individuals; however, this variability may reflect nonspecific or random factors.To investigate the assumption of systematic variability in symptomatic response to antidepressants and to assess whether this variability is associated with severity of major depressive disorder, antidepressant class, or year of study publication.Data used were from a recent network meta-analysis of acute treatment with licensed antidepressants in adults with major depressive disorder. The following databases were searched from inception to January 8, 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and PsycINFO. Additional sources were international trial registries, drug approval agency websites, and key scientific journals.Analysis was restricted to double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trials with available data at the study's end point.Baseline and end point means, SDs, number of participants in each group, antidepressant class, and publication year were extracted. The data were analyzed between August 1 and November 18, 2019.With the use of validated methods, coefficients of variation were derived for antidepressants and placebo, and their ratios were calculated to compare outcome variability between antidepressant and placebo. Ratios were entered into a random-effects model, with the expectation that response to antidepressants would be more variable than response to placebo. Analysis was repeated after stratifying by baseline severity of depression, antidepressant class (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone; serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine; norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor: bupropion; noradrenergic agents: amitriptyline and reboxetine; and other antidepressants: agomelatine, mirtazapine, and trazodone), and publication year.In the 8 eligible randomized placebo-controlled trials (17 54 unique participants), there was significantly more variability in response to antidepressants than to placebo (coefficients of variation ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17; P < .001). Baseline severity of depression did not moderate variability in response to antidepressants. Variability in response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was lower than variability in response to noradrenergic agents (coefficients of variation ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.97; P = .01), as was the variability in response to other antidepressants compared with noradrenergic agents (coefficients of variation ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97; P = .001). Variability also tended to be lower in studies that were published more recently, with coefficients of variation changing by a value of 0.005 (95% CI, 0.002-0.008; P = .003) for every year a study is more recent.Individual differences may be systematically associated with responses to antidepressants in major depressive disorder beyond placebo effects or statistical factors.

To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiviral immune responses.",2020-03-27,iScience,https://openalex.org/V2898358376,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.100958,100958,100958,23,3,1,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009388533,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.100958,journal-article,3009388533

Subgroup analyses compared the efficacy of MIP supplementation relative to training status and chronological age.The most common MIP supplements included protein with creatine (n=17) or vitamin D (n=10). Data from 3 trials with 138 participants showed significant (p<0.05) increases in FFM (0.8 kg (95% CI 0.4 to 1.15)), 1RM lower body (4.22 kg (95% CI 0.79 to 7.64)) and 1RM upper body (2.56 kg (95% CI 0.79 to 4.33)) where a supplement was compared with all non-MIP supplemented conditions (means (95% CI)). Subgroup analyses indicated a greater effect of MIP supplements compared with all non-MIP supplements on FFM in untrained (0.9 kg (95% CI 0.5 to 1.39), p<0.0001) and older participants (0.7 kg (95% CI 0.1 to 1.43), p=0.02); taking MIP supplements was also associated with gains in 1RM upper body (1.56 kg (95% CI 0.8 to 2.33), p=0.01) in older adults.When MIP supplements were combined with resistance exercise training, there were greater gains in FFM and strength in healthy adults than in counterparts who were supplemented with non-MIP. MIP supplements were not superior when directly compared with PRO supplements. The magnitude of effect of MIP supplements was greater (in absolute values) in untrained and elderly individuals undertaking RT than it was in trained individuals and in younger people.CRD42017081970.",2020-05-01,British Journal of Sports Medicine,https://openalex.org/V136578784,BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099889,573,581,54,10,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2919199585,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099889,journal-article,2919199585

Several studies confirmed an association between preeclampsia (PE) and psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. We conducted a systematic review of the literature aiming to investigate whether women with a history of PE are more likely to develop PPD or PPP, and whether PE is a risk factor for depression outside the perinatal period (PROSPERO protocol number CRD42018114188). We also conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the severity of depressive symptoms between women with and without a history of PE. A literature search with no year and no language restriction was conducted. The search yielded 95 articles, with 69 remaining after duplicate removal, and 13 being suitable for the systematic review. Eight of the 13 studies found an association between preeclampsia and depression. All studies assessed the impact of PE on depression, and only two studies assessed the impact of PE on PPP. Eight of the studies were included in the meta-analysis, which yielded a higher severity of depressive symptoms postpartum in women with PE. However, these results must be interpreted with caution considering the high heterogeneity of the included studies. Our meta-analysis also showed that women with a history of PE showed higher severity of depressive symptoms outside of the puerperal period. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that that PE is not only a risk factor for development of depression, but it is also associated with higher severity of depressive symptoms.",2020-08-01,Archives of women's mental health,https://openalex.org/V4210187589,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-019-01010-1,493,505,23,4,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992147584,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-019-01010-1,journal-article,2992147584

The AM network is a distributed brain network comprised largely by prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortical brain regions, which together facilitate AM. Autobiographical memories with high arousal and negatively valenced emotional states are thought to be retrieved more readily and re-experienced more vividly. This is critical in the case of trauma-related AMs, which are related to altered phenomenological experiences as well as aberrations to the underlying neural systems in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Critically, these alterations to the AM network have not been explored recently and have never been analyzed with consideration to the different processes of AM, them being retrieval and re-experiencing.We conducted a series of effect-size signed differential mapping meta-analyses across twenty-eight studies investigating the neural correlates of trauma-related AMs in participants with PTSD as compared with controls. Studies included either trauma-related scripts or trauma-related materials (i.e., sounds, images, pictures) implemented to evoke the recollection of a trauma-related memory.The meta-analyses revealed that control and PTSD participants displayed greater common brain activation of prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortices, respectively. Whereby the prefrontal medial cortices are suggested to facilitate retrieval monitoring, the posteromedial cortices are thought to enable the visual imagery processes of AM.Taken together, reduced common activation of prefrontal cortices may be interpreted as a bias toward greater re-experiencing, where the more salient elements of the traumatic memory are relived as opposed to retrieved in a controlled manner in PTSD.",2020-04-01,Depression and Anxiety,https://openalex.org/V192592622,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22977,321,345,37,4,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992638947,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22977,journal-article,2992638947

Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, NMRs), eusocial mammals that live in large colonies, are among the most mammals, and rely almost solely on decreases in metabolism with little change in ventilation during hypoxia. We hypothesized that the remarkable hypoxia tolerance of NMRs is an evolutionarily conserved trait derived from repeated exposure to severe hypoxia owing to their burrow environment and eusocial colony organization. Methods We used whole-body plethysmography and indirect calorimetry to measure the hypoxic ventilatory and metabolic responses of eight mole-rat species closely related to the NMR. Results We found that all eight species examined had a strong tolerance to hypoxia, with most species tolerating  kPa O2 , Heliophobius emini tolerating  kPa O2 and Bathyergus suillus tolerating  kPa O2 . All species examined employed a combination of increases in ventilation and decreases in metabolism in hypoxia, a response midway between that of the NMR and that of other fossorial species (larger ventilatory responses, lesser reductions in metabolism). We found that eusociality is not fundamental to the physiological response to hypoxia of NMRs as Fukomys damarensis, another eusocial species, was among this group. Conclusions Our data suggest that, while the NMR is unique in the pattern of their physiological response to hypoxia, eight closely related mole-rat species share the ability to tolerate hypoxia like the current hypoxia-tolerant champion, the NMR.",2020-04-01,Acta Physiologica,https://openalex.org/V204890612,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13436,,,228,4,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998139543,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13436,journal-article,2998139543

VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), generally should be treated for 3 months. VTE provoked by a persistent or progressive risk factor (eg, cancer), or a second unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, is generally treated indefinitely. First unprovoked proximal DVT or PE may be treated for 3 to  months or indefinitely. Male sex, presentation as PE (particularly if concomitant proximal DVT), a positive d-dimer test after stopping anticoagulation, an antiphospholipid antibody, low risk of bleeding, and patient preference favor indefinite anticoagulation. The type of indefinite anticoagulation is of secondary importance. Low-dose oral Xa inhibitors are convenient and are thought to have a lower risk of bleeding; they are less suitable if there is a higher risk for recurrence. For cancer-associated VTE, we now prefer full-dose oral Xa inhibitors over low-molecular-weight heparin, with gastrointestinal lesions being a relative contraindication. Graduated compression stockings are not routinely indicated after DVT, but are encouraged if there is persistent leg swelling or if a trial of stockings improves symptoms. Medications have a limited role in the treatment of postthrombotic syndrome. After PE, patients should have clinical surveillance for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), with ventilation-perfusion scanning and echocardiography being the initial diagnostic tests if CTEPH is a concern. Patients with CTEPH and other symptomatic patients with extensive residual perfusion defects should be evaluated for endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, or vasodilator therapies.",2020-01-30,Blood,https://openalex.org/V200071133,American Society of Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019002364,317,325,135,5,1,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999034462,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019002364,journal-article,2999034462

Among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients, incidence of brain metastases as site of first recurrence per year of median follow-up ranged from 0.1% to 3.2%. Although incidence of brain metastases was much higher among the metastatic breast cancer population overall, it was particularly high among metastatic HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative populations, ranging between 22% and 36% for the former, and 15%-37% for the latter in the absence of screening. Conclusion In patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, screening for asymptomatic brain metastases cannot currently be justified. However, due to the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with metastatic HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer, studies to determine the value of screening for brain metastases should be undertaken in these subgroups.",2020-02-01,Clinical Breast Cancer,https://openalex.org/V57202346,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2019.06.007,e54,e64,20,1,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962460569,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2019.06.007,journal-article,2962460569

Trip planning activities considered in the study include performing online tasks, deciding departure time, mode choice decision, deciding trip destination and communicating and coordinating trips by using smartphones. Travel outcomes include the number of new places visited, social gatherings attended and trips planned in groups. This study emphasizes the role of built-environment and attitudinal variables on smartphone use for travel. Following ordered response and binary choice modeling approach, this study identifies that age and attitudes (toward smartphone use and environment) play a significant role in using smartphones for trip planning as well as shaping travel outcomes. Millennials (16–34 years) are more likely to use smartphones for trip planning and perceive increase in travel outcomes compared to other age groups. In addition, tech-savvy attitude is positively associated with trip planning and travel outcomes. However, the influence of built-environment characteristics is comparatively low in relation to the other attributes considered in the analysis. The study also finds that those who highly use smartphone apps for social networking purposes are more likely to perceive increase in their travel outcomes.",2020-02-01,Sustainable Cities and Society,https://openalex.org/V163634330,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101939,101939,101939,53,,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984064371,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101939,journal-article,2984064371

The following key elements were addressed: definitions, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, dietary management, pharmacological treatments, and prevention. We covered the following questions: What are the most important clinical and laboratory features of the disease? What are the best approaches for the dietary management? What is the best way to classify the hydration status, and to prevent and treat the dehydration? What are the most effective and safe interventions for reducing the diarrhea and vomiting?Diarrheal diseases are one of the most common diseases in childhood. The most common cause is rotavirus. A key element in the approach of a child with diarrhea is determining their hydration status, which determines the fluid management. Laboratory tests are nor routinely required, as most of the cases, they do not affect the management and it should be indicated only in selected cases. Several treatments have been studied to reduce the duration of the diarrhea. Only symbiotics and zinc have shown to be effective and safe with high certainty on the evidence. Rest of the interventions although seem to be effective have low to very low quality of the evidence. The only effective and safe antiemetic for controlling vomiting is ondansetron.

However, the impact of the microbiota on their frequency and function at mucosal sites remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the microbiota in the regulation of enteric eosinophils. We found that small intestinal (SI) eosinophilia was significantly greater in germ-free (GF) mice compared to specific pathogen free (SPF) controls. This was associated with changes in the production of enteric signals that regulate eosinophil attraction and survival, and was fully reversed by complex colonization. Additionally, SI eosinophils of GF mice exhibited more cytoplasmic protrusions and less granule content than SPF controls. Lastly, we generated a novel strain of eosinophil-deficient GF mice. These mice displayed intestinal fibrosis and were less prone to allergic sensitization as compared to GF controls. Overall, our study demonstrates that commensal microbes regulate intestinal eosinophil frequency and function, which impacts tissue repair and allergic sensitization to food antigens. These data support a critical interplay between the commensal microbiota and intestinal eosinophils in shaping homeostatic, innate, and adaptive immune processes in health and disease.",2020-02-13,Frontiers in Immunology,https://openalex.org/V2595292759,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00155,,,11,,1,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005571621,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00155,journal-article,3005571621

A systematic review was conducted to identify LBP guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from 200 to 2018. The Guidelines International Network and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health websites were also searched. Eligible guidelines providing CAM recommendations were assessed with the AGREE II instrument. From 18 unique search results, 2 guidelines on the treatment and/or management of LBP were found, and 1 made recommendations on CAM therapy. With regard to scaled domain percentages, this overall guideline scored higher than the CAM section for  of  domains (overall, CAM): (1) scope and purpose (88.6%, 87.1%), (2) clarity of presentation (83.0%, 73.2%), (3) stakeholder involvement (57.0%, 41.7%), (4) rigor of development (47.2%, 44.7%), (5) editorial independence (34.8%, 34.8%) and (6) applicability (31.8%, 21.8%).

2020,14,6,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2977625447,Asynchronous Acoustic Localization and Tracking for Mobile Targets,"Recently, acoustic-based indoor localization has attracted much attention due to its affordable infrastructure costs and high localization accuracy. However, previous work is infeasible in mobile target tracking for its long latency in obtaining sufficient beacon messages. In addition, the performance can further deteriorate due to device diversity, varying channel gains, and background noises. To this end, we propose an asynchronous acoustic localization and tracking system (AALTS), which utilizes distributed acoustic anchor nodes to locate passive off-the-shelf mobile devices. In AALTS, we propose an orthogonal chirp spread spectrum (OCSS) modulation technique, which doubles the data rate and thus mitigates the latency. We design a more robust method to capture acoustic signals which embody timestamps for localization, accounting for device diversity, varying channel gains, and the multipath effect. Finally, we incorporate an acoustic Doppler speed estimation module with a path-based particle filter framework to accurately track the moving targets. We have evaluated AALTS in an indoor testbed of size $8\times 12\,\,\text{m}^{2}$ with commodity mobile phones and customized acoustic anchors. Our evaluation results demonstrate remarkable performance: AALTS achieves 90-percentile tracking errors of 0.4 m for mobile targets and a median of 0.1 m for stationary ones with only four anchor nodes.",2020-02-01,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,https://openalex.org/V2480266640,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2019.2945054,830,845,7,2,0,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977625447,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2019.2945054,journal-article,2977625447

However, they examined all probiotic strains (multi/single probiotics) simultaneously. In respect to strain specificity properties of probiotic, the aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the role of Lactobacillus plantarum as an anti-hypertensive agent by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were used from inception until October 201 to identify eligible trials. We used random-effects model as the preferable method to assess the combined treatment effect. We further conducted sensitivity analysis and stratified analysis. Seven studies with 65 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) with the random effects model showed a significant effects of Lactobacillus plantarum supplementation on improvement of SBP with no statistically significant heterogeneity (WMD: -1.5 mmHg, 95 % CI: -3.05 to 0.11) (heterogeneity P = 0.14; I² = 3 %).

Genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens revealed that loss of the mitochondrial proteases CLPP and MIPEP confer strong resistance to both compounds... Systematic genetic interaction profiles can reveal the mechanisms-of-action of bioactive compounds. The imipridone ONC201, which is currently in cancer clinical trials, has been ascribed a variety of different targets. To investigate the genetic dependencies of imipridone action, we screened a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout library in the presence of either ONC201 or its more potent analog ONC212. Loss of the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP or the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase MIPEP conferred strong resistance to both compounds. Biochemical and surrogate genetic assays showed that impridones directly activate CLPP and that MIPEP is necessary for proteolytic maturation of CLPP into a catalytically competent form. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cells treated with ONC212 revealed degradation of many mitochondrial as well as nonmitochondrial proteins. Prompted by the conservation of ClpP from bacteria to humans, we found that the imipridones also activate ClpP from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in biochemical and genetic assays. ONC212 and acyldepsipeptide-4 (ADEP4), a known activator of bacterial ClpP, caused similar proteome-wide degradation profiles in S. aureus. ONC212 suppressed the proliferation of a number of Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Enterococcus faecium) and Gram-negative species (E. coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Moreover, ONC212 enhanced the ability of rifampin to eradicate antibiotic-tolerant S. aureus persister cells.

This work investigates the use of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the surface of electrically conductive membranes (ECMs) to measure early development of membrane surface fouling. An electrochemical cell was developed in which an ECM acted as a working electrode and a graphite electrode acted as the counter electrode. Conductive membranes were fabricated by coating single-walled/double-walled carbon nanotubes (f-SW/DWCNT) on microfiltration polyethersulfone (PES) supporting membranes. Membrane fouling was simulated by pressure depositing different amounts of latex beads onto the surface of the membrane in a dead-end filtration cell. Changes in membrane water permeability were correlated to the degree of membrane fouling. Clean membranes had water permeability of 392 ± 28 LMH/bar. Reduction of membrane water permeability of 13.8 ± 3.3%, 15.8 ± 4.7%, 17.8 ± 0.5% and 27.1 ± 4.6% were observed for membranes covered with 0.028 mg/m2, 0.28 mg/m2, 1.40 mg/m2 and 2.80 mg/m2 on the membranes, respectively. These small differences in fouling degree were statistically resolvable in measured Nyquist plots. It was observed that the diameter of the higher frequency charge transfer region (104–106 Hz) of the Nyquist plot semicircles increased with greater fouling. These observations were hypothesized to correspond to decreasing surface conductivities of the membranes by the incorporation of insulating materials (latex beads) within the porous conductive coating. This proposed hypothesis was supported by measured EIS results modeled with a theoretical equivalent circuit. Fouled membrane surface conductivity, surface hydrophilicity, and pore size were measured by SEM, four-point probe conductivity, contact angle, and MWCO experiments, respectively, to compare conventional characterization techniques with non-destructive EIS measurements.",2020-07-01,Separation and Purification Technology,https://openalex.org/V69753523,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116823,116823,116823,242,,0,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009229500,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116823,journal-article,3009229500

Here, we used complementary in situ measurements, model simulations, and satellite observations to investigate the net carbon dioxide (CO2 ) seasonal cycle and its climatic and environmental controls across Alaska and northwestern Canada during the anomalously warm winter to spring conditions of 201 and 201 (relative to 2010-2014). In the warm spring, we found that photosynthesis was enhanced more than respiration, leading to greater CO2 uptake. However, photosynthetic enhancement from spring warming was partially offset by greater ecosystem respiration during the preceding anomalously warm winter, resulting in nearly neutral effects on the annual net CO2 balance. Eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements showed that air temperature has a primary influence on net CO2 exchange in winter and spring, while soil moisture has a primary control on net CO2 exchange in the fall. The net CO2 exchange was generally more moisture limited in the boreal region than in the Arctic tundra. Our analysis indicates complex seasonal interactions of underlying C cycle processes in response to changing climate and hydrology that may not manifest in changes in net annual CO2 exchange. Therefore, a better understanding of the seasonal response of C cycle processes may provide important insights for predicting future carbon-climate feedbacks and their consequences on atmospheric CO2 dynamics in the northern high latitudes.",2020-02-01,Global Change Biology,https://openalex.org/V74970393,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14863,682,696,26,2,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979508918,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14863,journal-article,2979508918

A recent solution places row-based cooling unit adjacent to servers and places the entire assembly within an enclosure, which improves airflow distribution and provides rapid real-time control. This is, in particular attractive for micro-data centers where traditional room-based cooling is less energy efficient. Spatiotemporal predictions of temperatures are required to control and optimize data center performance as the system configuration, and other parameters are varied. Current methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, machine learning, and heuristic models are inapplicable in practice because they require a prohibitively large number of a priori simulations or experiments to generate training datasets. We provide an alternative a computationally inexpensive training-free model for enclosed micro-data centers that are integrated with in-row cooling units that requires no a priori training. The model determines the air flowrate within each zone based on a mechanical resistance circuit analysis. These flowrates are then introduced into a zonal energy balance to predict the temperature of each zone. The methodology is validated with experimental measurements and coupled with a power consumption calculation. Its applicability is demonstrated by evaluating the influence of various system factors, such as IT server configurations, cooling unit air, and water flowrates and the numbers of cooling units, on the temperature distributions, and total cooling power consumption.

Previously, we found that curcumin can block HSV-2 infection and abrogate the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by genital epithelial cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated whether curcumin, encapsulated in nanoparticles and delivered by various in vivo routes, could minimize inflammation and prevent or reduce HSV-2 infection in the FGT. Female mice were pre-treated with curcumin nanoparticles through oral, intraperitoneal and intravaginal routes, and then exposed intravaginally to the tissue inflammation stimulant CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). Local intravaginal delivery of curcumin nanoparticles, but not intraperitoneal or oral delivery, reduced CpG-mediated inflammatory histopathology and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin (IL)-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) in the FGT. However, curcumin nanoparticles did not demonstrate anti-viral activity nor reduce tissue pathology when administered prior to intravaginal HSV-2 infection. In an alternative approach, intravaginal pre-treatment with crude curcumin or solid dispersion formulations of curcumin demonstrated increased survival and delayed pathology following HSV-2 infection.

Our objective was to characterize motor activities throughout the entire colon that possessed persistent rhythmicity and spanning at least  cm. Methods High-resolution colonic manometry using an 84-channel water-perfused catheter was performed in 1 healthy volunteers. Rhythmic activity was assessed during baseline, proximal balloon distention, meal, and bisacodyl administration. Key results Throughout the entire colon, a cyclic motor pattern occurred either in isolation or following a high-amplitude propagating pressure wave (HAPW), consisting of clusters of pressure waves at a frequency centered on 11-13 cycles/min, unrelated to breathing. The cluster duration was 1-6 minutes; the pressure waves traveled for 8-27 cm, lasting 5-8 seconds. The clusters itself could be rhythmic at 0.5-2 cpm. The propagation direction of the individual pressure waves was mixed with >50% occurring simultaneous. This high-frequency cyclic motor pattern co-existed with the well-known low-frequency cyclic motor pattern centered on 3-4 cpm. In the rectum, the low-frequency cyclic motor pattern dominated, propagating predominantly in retrograde direction. Proximal balloon distention, a meal and bisacodyl administration induced HAPWs followed by cyclic motor patterns. Conclusions and inferences Within cyclic motor patterns, retrograde propagating, low-frequency pressure waves dominate in the rectum, likely keeping the rectum empty; and mixed propagation, high-frequency pressure waves dominate in the colon, likely promoting absorption and storage, hence contributing to continence.

Overall, Canadian medical students spend 92.8 (± 45.4) hours (mean ± SD) studying gross anatomy, 25.2 (± 21.0) hours for histology, and 7.4 (± 4.3) hours for embryology. Gross anatomy contact hours statistically significantly exceeded those for histology and embryology. Results show that most content is delivered in the first year of medical school, as anatomy is a foundational building block for upper-year courses. Laboratory contact time for gross anatomy was 56.8 (± 30.7) hours, histology was 11.4 (± 16.2) hours, and embryology was 0.25 (± 0.6) hours. Additionally, 42% of programs predominantly used instructor/technician-made prosections, another 33% used a mix of dissection and prosections and 25% have their students complete cadaveric dissections. Teaching is either completely or partially integrated into all Canadian medical curricula. This integration trend in Canada parallels those of other medical schools around the world where programs have begun to decrease contact time in anatomy and increase integration of the anatomical sciences into other courses. Compared to published American data, Canadian schools offer less contact time. The reason for this gap is unknown. Further investigation is required to determine if the amount of anatomical science education within medical school affects students' performance in clerkship, residency and beyond.",2020-05-01,Anatomical Sciences Education,https://openalex.org/V121323410,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1960,381,389,13,3,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012325041,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1960,journal-article,3012325041

Here, for the first time, we elucidate that product gaseous bubble accumulation on the electrode/electrolyte interface is the direct cause of the voltage instability in CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzers. Although bubble formation in water electrolyzers has been extensively studied, we identified that voltage instability caused by bubble formation is unique to CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzers. The appearance of syngas bubbles within the electrolyte at the gas diffusion electrode (GDE)-electrolyte chamber interface (i.e. ∼10% bubble coverage of the GDE surface) was accompanied by voltage oscillations of 60 mV. The presence of syngas in the electrolyte chamber physically inhibited two-phase reaction interfaces, thereby resulting in unstable cell performance. The strategic incorporation of our insights on bubble growth behavior and voltage instability is vital for designing commercially relevant CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzers.",2020-05-22,iScience,https://openalex.org/V2898358376,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101094,101094,101094,23,5,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017828098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101094,journal-article,3017828098

The purpose of this research was to identify the quantity and assess the quality of CAM recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment and/or management of RA and OA. A systematic review was conducted to identify CPGs; MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from 200 to 2018. The Guidelines International Network and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health websites were also searched. Three independent reviewers evaluated the quality of reporting for each guideline that provided CAM recommendations, and the specific section providing CAM recommendations, using the AGREE II instrument. From 52 unique search results, seven guidelines (3 OA, 4 RA) mentioned CAM and 5 guidelines made CAM recommendations.

VR therapy may be an effective intervention for improving cognitive function following stroke. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of exercise-based VR therapy on cognition post-stroke.Electronic databases were searched for terms related to ""stroke"", ""virtual reality"", ""exercise"" and ""cognition"". Studies were included if they: (1) were randomized-controlled trials; (2) included VR-based interventions; (3) included individuals with stroke; and (4) included outcome measures related to cognitive function. Data from included studies were synthesised qualitatively and where possible, random effects meta-analyses were performed.Eight studies involving 19 participants were included in the review, of which five were included in meta-analyses (n = 12 participants). Studies varied in terms of type (combination of VR therapy and conventional therapy, combination of VR therapy and computer-based cognitive training, VR therapy alone) and duration of interventions (20-180 min), sample size (n = 12-42), length of the interventions (4-8 weeks), and cognitive outcomes examined. VR therapy was not more effective than control for improving global cognition (n = 5, SMD = 0.24, 95%CI:-0.30,0.78, p = .38), memory (n = 2 studies, SMD= 0.00, 95%CI: -0.58, 0.59, p = .99), attention (n = 2 studies, MD = 8.90, 95%CI: -27.89, 45.70, p = .64) or language (n = 2 studies, SMD = 0.56, 95%CI: -0.08,1.21, p = .09).VR therapy was not superior to control interventions in improving cognition in individuals with stroke.

Therefore, for sustainable management of common pool water resources, the behaviors of the main stakeholders and their interactions should be taken into account. In this paper, a new conflict resolution model based on the agent-based modeling approach is introduced for the evaluation of different water management policies through the simulation of all stakeholders’ behaviors. Moreover, the leader-follower interactions among stakeholders are modeled using the Stackelberg game theory-based model. The methodology is applied to the western part of Tehran, Iran, as a developing urban case study, where there are different stakeholders and water users with conflicting objectives.

METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a systematic search of publications through CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE originally up to July 2017, and then updated to June 2019. The study was registered (PROSPERO ID: CRD42017069685) prior to its initiation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included that tested an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention (compared to usual care) primarily in a heart failure population. Main outcomes assessed were hospitalizations, mortality, QOL, and symptom burden. Ten independent RCTs were selected, representing a total of 1050 participants (921 with a diagnosis of heart failure). Compared with usual care, palliative care interventions were associated with a substantial reduction in hospitalizations [odds ratio 0.56 (0.33-0.94); four trials; I2  = 27%], modest improvement in QOL [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.45; seven trials; I2  = 15%], and modest reduction in symptom burden (SMD -0.29; 95% CI -0.54-0.03; three trials; I2  = 15%). There was no clear adverse impact on mortality. Most studies had methodological limitations that increased the risk of biases.

However, it is unclear which brain regions respond to bacteria-derived signals or how signals are transmitted to distinct regions. We investigated the role of the vagus in mediating neuronal activation following oral treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1). Male Balb/c mice were orally administered a single dose of saline or a live or heat-killed preparation of a physiologically active bacterial strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1). 165 min later, c-Fos immunoreactivity in the brain was mapped, and mesenteric vagal afferent fibre firing was recorded. Mice also underwent sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy to investigate whether severing the vagus prevented JB-1-induced c-Fos expression. Finally, we examined the ΔFosB response following acute versus chronic bacterial treatment. While a single exposure to live and heat-killed bacteria altered vagal activity, only live treatment induced rapid neural activation in widespread but distinct brain regions, as assessed by c-Fos expression. Sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy abolished c-Fos immunoreactivity in most, but not all, previously responsive regions. Chronic, but not acute treatment induced a distinct pattern of ΔFosB expression, including in previously unresponsive brain regions. These data identify that specific brain regions respond rapidly to gut microbes via vagal-dependent and independent pathways, and demonstrate that acute versus long-term exposure is associated with differential responses in distinct brain regions.",2020-06-15,Neuropharmacology,https://openalex.org/V160566677,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108067,108067,108067,170,,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013663119,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108067,journal-article,3013663119

Although valuable, this work-up process can lead to attrition before surgery. Therefore, we aim to assess patient and health system factors associated with attrition after bariatric surgery referral in a universal healthcare system.This was a population-based study of all patients aged ≥ 1 referred for bariatric surgery in Ontario, Canada from 200 to 2015. Primary outcome was patients who dropped out of bariatric surgery after referral. Predictors of attrition after referral included patient demographics, clinical, institutional, and socioeconomic variables. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated by multilevel logistic regression models.From 17,703 patients that were referred for bariatric surgery, 412 patients dropped after the initial referral. Male patients, increasing age, and longer wait times for surgery were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with higher odds of attrition. Additionally, smoker status, immigration status, unemployment, and disability were significant factors (P < 0.0001) predicting attrition. Patients who lived in lowest income quintile neighborhoods, when compared to those from the richest neighborhoods, had significantly higher odds of attrition (P = 0.02). Sleep apnea was associated with lower odds of attrition while diabetes and heart failure both with higher odds of attrition.Even in a universal healthcare system, there are various factors that could lead to increased odds of attrition before bariatric surgery.

However, the current academic literature has not studied the impact of disruption on rail hazmat shipments. This study proposes a bi-objective two-stage stochastic program that makes use a of new measure of risk to plan rail shipments in the presence of random disruptions. Complexity of the resulting mathematical model motivated the development of an augmented ɛ-constraint solution technique, which was used to study the railroad infrastructure in Midwest United States. The resulting analyses throw light on the trade-off between hazmat risk versus cost, and suggest that deploying contingency plans for disruptions can significantly mitigate hazmat risks with only a slight increase in total cost.

In this study, a hydrologic model was developed and applied to systematically investigated the influence of operating algorithms (e.g., “yield before spillage”, YBS and “yield after spillage”, YAS), length and temporal scale of rainfall time series on the assessment of water saving and stormwater control performance of RH for a case study application in Seattle, USA. Three performance indices (water saving efficiency, reliability, and stormwater capture efficiency) were analyzed considering four water demand scenarios. The results show that the YBS algorithm results in overestimation of the three indices while the YAS tends to underestimate them. The influence of operating algorithm selection can be diminished by using smaller simulation time steps for RH systems with larger tanks. The indices obtained using daily time series are close to those generated with the hourly ones, while the use of monthly time series generates inaccurate results. As the time series length of simulation increases, the difference between the indicator values obtained using short-term simulation periods and the reference 49-year period reduces. Representative rainfall time series length of 13, 15, 17, and 15 years for toilet flushing, laundry, lawn irrigation, and mixture of the demands, respectively, is determined and verified to be sufficient to generate equivalent indicator values to those obtained using a 30-year long time series.

Influencing the content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing.We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007 and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved with discussion.

Invasive species constitute powerful in situ experimental systems to study fast adaptation and directional selection on short ecological timescales and present promising case studies to understand factors involved the impressive ability of some species to colonize novel environments. We seize the unique opportunity presented by the round goby invasion to study genomic substrates potentially involved in colonization success. Results We report a highly contiguous long-read-based genome and analyze gene families that we hypothesize to relate to the ability of these fish to deal with novel environments. The analyses provide novel insights from the large evolutionary scale to the small species-specific scale. We describe expansions in specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, a remarkably diverse innate immune system, an ancient duplication in red light vision accompanied by red skin fluorescence, evolutionary patterns of epigenetic regulators, and the presence of osmoregulatory genes that may have contributed to the round goby’s capacity to invade cold and salty waters. A recurring theme across all analyzed gene families is gene expansions. Conclusions The expanded innate immune system of round goby may potentially contribute to its ability to colonize novel areas. Since other gene families also feature copy number expansions in the round goby, and since other Gobiidae also feature fascinating environmental adaptations and are excellent colonizers, further long-read genome approaches across the goby family may reveal whether gene copy number expansions are more generally related to the ability to conquer new habitats in Gobiidae or in fish.",2020-01-28,BMC Biology,https://openalex.org/V25903957,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-019-0731-8,,,18,1,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003660938,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-019-0731-8,journal-article,3003660938

Among 1 studies reporting use among athletes (n = 46,202), approximately 23.4% of respondents reported using cannabis in the past 1 months. Two studies found a negative impact on performance, while another  studies found no impact. There was no literature on the influence of cannabis on athletic recovery.

Based on the available evidence, cannabis does not appear to positively affect performance, but the literature surrounding this is generally poor. Given the variability in regulation across different sport types and competition levels, as well as the growing number of states legalizing recreational cannabis use, there is a need to improve our understanding of the effects of cannabis use on the athlete and perhaps adopt a clearer and overarching policy for the use of cannabis by athletes in all sports and at all levels.",2020-02-05,Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach,https://openalex.org/V86871763,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738120901670,189,199,12,2,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004789288,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738120901670,journal-article,3004789288

Dozens of different 'population analyses' are in use, which are best seen as proxies (indirect gauges) rather than measurements of a 'general ionicity'. For the GMTKN55 benchmark of nearly 2,500 main-group molecules, which span a broad swathe of chemical space, some two dozen different charge distributions were evaluated at the PBE0 level near the 1-particle basis set limit. The correlation matrix between the different charge distributions exhibits a block structure; blocking is, broadly speaking, by charge distribution class. A principal component analysis on the entire dataset suggests that nearly all variation can be accounted for by just two 'principal components of ionicity': one has all the distributions going in sync, while the second corresponds mainly to Bader QTAIM vs. all others. A weaker third component corresponds to electrostatic charge models in opposition to the orbital-based ones. The single charge distributions that have the greatest statistical similarity to the first principal component are iterated Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I) and a minimal-basis projected modification of Bickelhaupt charges. If three individual variables, rather than three principal components, are to be identified that contain most of the information in the whole dataset, one representative for each of the three classes of Corminboeuf et al. is needed: one based on partitioning of the density (such as QTAIM), a second based on orbital partitioning (such as NPA), and a third based on the molecular electrostatic potential (such as HLY or CHELPG).",2020-02-13,ChemPhysChem,https://openalex.org/V169445072,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202000040,688,696,21,8,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005765690,https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202000040,journal-article,3005765690

The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society. Key points: Sleep restriction has previously been associated with the loss of muscle mass in both human and animal models. The rate of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) is a key variable in regulating skeletal muscle mass and can be increased by performing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), although the effect of sleep restriction on MyoPS is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that participants undergoing a sleep restriction protocol (five nights, with  h in bed each night) had lower rates of skeletal muscle MyoPS; however, rates of MyoPS were maintained at control levels by performing HIIE during this period. Our data suggest that the lower rates of MyoPS in the sleep restriction group may contribute to the detrimental effects of sleep loss on muscle mass and that HIIE may be used as an intervention to counteract these effects. Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep restriction, with or without high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), on the potential mechanisms underpinning previously-reported sleep-loss-induced reductions to muscle mass. Twenty-four healthy, young men underwent a protocol consisting of two nights of controlled baseline sleep and a five-night intervention period. Participants were allocated into one of three parallel groups, matched for age, (Formula presented.), body mass index and habitual sleep duration; a normal sleep (NS) group [8 h time in bed (TIB) each night], a sleep restriction (SR) group (4 h TIB each night), and a sleep restriction and exercise group (SR+EX, 4 h TIB each night, with three sessions of HIIE). Deuterium oxide was ingested prior to commencing the study and muscle biopsies obtained pre- and post-intervention were used to assess myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) and molecular markers of protein synthesis and degradation signalling pathways. MyoPS was lower in the SR group [fractional synthetic rate (% day–1), mean ± SD, 1.24 ± 0.21] compared to both the NS (1.53 ± 0.09) and SR+EX groups (1.61 ± 0.14) (P < 0.05). However, there were no changes in the purported regulators of protein synthesis (i.e. p-AKTser473 and p-mTORser2448) and degradation (i.e. Foxo1/3 mRNA and LC3 protein) in any group. These data suggest that MyoPS is acutely reduced by sleep restriction, although MyoPS can be maintained by performing HIIE. These findings may explain the sleep-loss-induced reductions in muscle mass previously reported and also highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of HIIE to maintain myofibrillar remodelling in this context.",2020-04-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278828,1523,1536,598,8,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008175177,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278828,journal-article,3008175177

To date, however, the neurophysiological and molecular mechanisms underlying exercise-induced neuroplasticity remain largely unknown impeding the potential utilization of exercise protocols as 'motor learning boosters' in clinical and non-clinical settings. Here, we assessed corticospinal excitability, intracortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and serum biochemical markers including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), total and precursor cathepsin B (tCTSB, proCTSB), uncarboxylated and carboxylated osteocalcin (unOCN, cOCN) and irisin using ELISA. Measurements were carried out in sedentary, healthy males before and after a single session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) or in individuals who rested and did not perform exercise (No Exercise). We found that HIIE increased corticospinal excitability, BDNF and unOCN, and decreased cOCN. We also determined that greater increases in BDNF were associated with increases in unOCN and irisin and decreases in cOCN only in participants who underwent HIIE, suggesting that unOCN and irisin may contribute to exercise-induced BDNF increases. Conversely, no changes other than a decrease in serum unOCN/tOCN were found in No Exercise participants. The present findings show that a single session of HIIE is sufficient to modulate corticospinal excitability and to increase BDNF and unOCN in sedentary, healthy males.",2020-06-15,Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V30122339,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.03.042,242,255,437,,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031608662,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.03.042,journal-article,3031608662

As the number of bariatric surgeries continues to grow, the need for consensus guidelines for optimal perioperative care is imperative. In colorectal surgery, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols were created for this purpose. The objective of this review is to develop evidence-based ERAS guidelines for bariatric surgery. A literature search of the MEDLINE database was performed using ERAS-specific search terms. Recently published articles with a focus on randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE assessment system. Canadian bariatric surgeons from six provinces and ten bariatric centers performed a review of the evidence surrounding ERAS in bariatric surgery and created consensus guidelines for 14 essential ERAS elements. Our main recommendations were (1) to encourage participation in a presurgical weight loss program; (2) to abstain from tobacco and excessive alcohol; (3) low-calorie liquid diet for at least 2 weeks prior to surgery; (4) to avoid preanesthetic anxiolytics and long-acting opioids; (5) unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin prior to surgery; (6) antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin ± metronidazole; (7) reduced opioids during surgery; (8) surgeon preference regarding intraoperative leak testing; (9) nasogastric intubation needed only for Veress access; (10) to avoid abdominal drains and urinary catheters; (11) to prevent ileus by discontinuing intravenous fluids early; (12) postoperative analgesia with acetaminophen, short-term NSAIDS, and minimal opioids; (13) to resume full fluid diet on first postoperative day; (14) early telephone follow-up with full clinic follow-up at 3–4 weeks. The purpose of addressing these ERAS elements is to develop guidelines that can be implemented and practiced clinically.

In a single blind, parallel-group design, 2 young women (21 ±  years, n = 12/group) consumed a weight-maintaining baseline diet containing 0. g/kg/d of protein before being randomized to consume either 2 g of PP twice daily (1.6 g/kg/d total protein) or a control diet (CON) (0.8 g/kg/d total protein) for  wks. Unilateral RE (~30% of maximal strength to failure) was performed thrice weekly with the opposite limb serving as a non-exercised control (Rest). MPS was measured by deuterated water ingestion at baseline, following supplementation (Rest), and following supplementation + RE (Exercise). Ingestion of PP stimulated MPS by 0.14 ± 0.0 %/d at Rest, and by 0.3 ± 0.14 %/d in the Exercise limb. MPS was significantly elevated by 0.2 ± 0.1 %/d in the Exercise limb in CON (p = 0.008). Consuming PP to increase protein intake to levels twice the recommended dietary allowance for protein augmented rates of MPS. Performance of RE stimulated MPS regardless of protein intake.

We identify the IHSC using an improved phase-space galaxy finder algorithm which provides an adaptive, physically motivated and shape-independent definition of this stellar component, that can be applied to halos of arbitrary masses. We explore the IHSC mass fraction-total halo's stellar mass, $f_{M*,IHSC}-M*$, relation and the physical drivers of its scatter. We find that on average the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with $M_{*,tot}$, with the scatter decreasing strongly with mass from 2 dex at $M_{*,tot}\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to 0.3 dex at group masses. At high masses, $M_{*,tot}>10^{11.5}M_\odot$, $f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with the number of substructures, and with the mass ratio between the central galaxy and largest satellite, at fixed $M_{*,tot}$. From mid-size groups and systems below $M_{*,tot}<10^{12}M_\odot$, we find that the central galaxy's stellar rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio, V/{\sigma}, displays the strongest (anti)-correlation with $f_{M*,IHSC}$ at fixed $M_{*,tot}$ of all the galaxy and halo properties explored, transitioning from $f_{M*,IHSC}$<0.1% for high V/{\sigma}, to $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim5$% for low V/{\sigma} galaxies. By studying the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ temporal evolution, we find that, in the former, mergers not always take place, but if they did, they happened early (z>1), while the high $f_{M*,IHSC}$ population displays a much more active merger history. In the case of massive groups and galaxy clusters, $M_{*,tot}>10^{12}M_\odot$, a fraction $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim$10-20% is reached at $z\sim1$ and then they evolve across lines of constant $f_{M*,IHSC}$ modulo some small perturbations.

Isotopic tracers and flow modeling are used in this study to understand the groundwater flow system of a semi-confined aquifer of Pleistocene (>10 kyr) age in Bangladesh that is generally low in As but has been perturbed by massive pumping at a distance of about 25 km for the municipal water supply of Dhaka. A 10- to 15-m-thick clay aquitard caps much of the intermediate aquifer (>40- to 90-m depth) in the 3-km2 study area, with some interruptions by younger channel sand deposits indicative of river scouring. Hydraulic heads in the intermediate aquifer below the clay-capped areas are 1–2 m lower than in the high-As shallow aquifer above the clay layer. In contrast, similar heads in the shallow and intermediate aquifer are observed where the clay layer is missing. The head distribution suggests a pattern of downward flow through interruptions in the aquitard and lateral advection from the sandy areas to the confined portion of the aquifer. The interpreted flow system is consistent with 3H-3He ages, stable isotope data, and groundwater flow modeling. Lateral flow could explain an association of elevated As with high methane concentrations within layers of gray sand below certain clay-capped portions of the Pleistocene aquifer. An influx of dissolved organic carbon from the clay layer itself leading to a reduction of initially orange sands has also likely contributed to the rise of As.",2020-07-01,Water Resources Research,https://openalex.org/V204847658,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020wr027178,,,56,7,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021390446,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020wr027178,journal-article,3021390446

Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. METHODS Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3 years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5 years. RESULTS Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score < 20) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD.

Metal meshes have been previously used to harvest fog droplets from air streams. By merging these two observations, we hypothesize that TiO2/ZnO-coated metal meshes installed in the path of a fog-laden wind carrying contaminants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), will degrade these VOCs providing pollution abatement. Stainless steel meshes are coated with a uniform, homogeneous and durable film of TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticles using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) in a phosphate ester solution. The TiO2-coated metal meshes are first activated with UV irradiation and then exposed to a fog-stream in a fog-tunnel, where the fog is pre-seeded with a VOC surrogate, methylene blue (MB), of known concentration. UV–Vis spectroscopy measurements of the water harvested determine the extent of MB degradation. The mechanism by which the phosphate ester develops an electrical charge on a nanoparticle surface leads to a conformal coating over the steel mesh. Maximum MB (0.05 mM) degradation of 36% is observed. Similar photocatalytic degradation of MB by TiO2 and ZnO coated meshes is also observed under direct UV irradiation from sunlight, confirming that the method is viable for outdoor installations.",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,https://openalex.org/V106928643,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.100,3777,3785,46,3,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979616579,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.100,journal-article,2979616579

In order to account for uncertainties and to reduce the computational times and retain accuracy, moment matching is used to discretize uncertain distributions. Diverse scenarios are constructed by random sampling of the vectors which contain discrete distributions of uncertain parameters. System design is carried out to minimize the annual total cost and to limit the average of the worst-case emissions with the 5% probability which corresponds to the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of emissions for the confidence level of 95%. The effects of the different values of CVaR on the design of the system are examined. It is shown how the system size changes due to uncertainty and as a function of the CDE target value. Design of an energy system for office buildings in Dalian, China, is presented. Since there is no significant amount of flat surfaces available in a dense urban core, photovoltaics and thermal solar are not considered as candidates for system components.

However, the educational impacts of these assessment approaches remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to explore trainee perceptions regarding the impacts of EPAs and entrustment scales on feedback and learning processes in the clinical setting. Methods Four focus groups were conducted with postgraduate trainees in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, general internal medicine and nephrology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Data collection and analysis were informed by principles of constructivist grounded theory. Results Entrustable professional activities representing well-defined tasks are perceived as potentially effective drivers for feedback and learning. Use of EPAs and entrustment scales, however, may augment existing tensions between developmental (for learning) and decision-making (of learning) assessment functions. Three key dilemmas seem to influence the impact of EPA-based assessment approaches on residents' learning: (a) standardisation of outcomes versus flexibility in assessment to align with individual learning experiences; (b) assessment tasks focusing on performance standards versus opportunities for learning, and (c) feedback focusing on numeric entrustment scores versus narrative and dialogue. Use of entrustment as an assessment outcome may impact trainees' motivation and feelings of self-efficacy, further enhancing tensions between learning and performance.

Oxidative stress within this tissue, derived from the dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been linked to a number of adverse fetal outcomes. While such outcomes have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrially generated ROS in altering the process of placentation remains unclear. In this study, mitochondrial complex I activity was attenuated using 1 nM rotenone to induce cellular oxidative stress by increasing mitochondrial ROS production in the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. Increased mitochondrial ROS resulted in a significant decrease in the transcripts which encode for proteins associated with fusion (GCM1, ERVW-1, and ERVFRD-1) resulting in a 5-fold decrease in the percentage of BeWo fusion. This outcome was associated with increased indicators of mitochondrial fragmentation, as determined by decreased expression of MFN2 and OPA1 along with an increase in a marker of mitochondrial fission (DRP1). Importantly, increased mitochondrial ROS also resulted in a 5.0-fold reduction of human placental lactogen (PL) and a 4.4-fold reduction of insulin like growth factor  (IGF2) transcripts; hormones which play an important role in regulating fetal growth.

Although the 2020 Anaphylaxis GRADE guideline better informs the practice of anaphylaxis prevention through (1) identification and mitigation of risk factors for biphasic anaphylaxis and (2) evaluation of the use of glucocorticoid and/or antihistamine pretreatment, all GRADE recommendations, although directional, are conditional and as such should not be universally applied to every circumstance.Clinical guidelines provide an important opportunity to critically appraise evidence and translate evidence to practice.

Overcoming this healthcare crisis requires new approaches in antibiotic discovery and the identification of unique bacterial targets. In this work, we describe a chemical genomics approach to identify inhibitors of Salmonella virulence. From a cell-based, promoter reporter screen of ∼50,000 small molecules, we identified dephostatin as a non-antibiotic compound that inhibits intracellular virulence factors and polymyxin resistance genes. Dephostatin disrupts signaling through both the SsrA-SsrB and PmrB-PmrA two-component regulatory systems and restores sensitivity to the last-resort antibiotic, colistin. Cell-based experiments and mouse models of infection demonstrate that dephostatin attenuates Salmonella virulence in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that perturbing regulatory networks is a promising strategy for the development of anti-infectives.",2020-07-16,Cell chemical biology,https://openalex.org/V4210231961,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.04.005,793,805.e7,27,7,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024802608,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.04.005,journal-article,3024802608

Patient and family engagement in Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the primary care setting could improve the concordance between patients’ wishes and the healthcare received when patients cannot speak for themselves. The aim of this study was to better understand the barriers faced by older patients regarding talking to their family members and family physicians about ACP. Methods In this multi-site cross-sectional study, three free text questions regarding reasons patients found it difficult to discuss ACP with their families or their family physicians were part of a self-administered questionnaire about patients’ knowledge of and engagement in ACP. The questionnaire, which included closed ended questions followed by three probing open ended questions, was distributed in 2 family practices across  provinces in Canada. The free text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and form the basis of this paper. Results One hundred two participants provided an analyzable response to the survey when asked why they haven’t talked to someone about ACP. Two hundred fifty-four answered the question about talking to their physician and 34 answered the question about talking to family members. Eight distinct themes emerged from the free text response analysis: 1. They were too young for ACP; 2. The topic is too emotional; 3. The Medical Doctor (MD) should be responsible for bringing up ACP 4. A fear of negatively impacting the patient-physician relationship; 5. Not enough time in appointments; 6. Concern about family dynamics; 7. It’s not a priority; and 8. A lack of knowledge about ACP. Conclusions Patients in our sample described many barriers to ACP discussions, including concerns about the effect these discussions may have on relationships with both family members and family physicians, and issues relating to patients’ knowledge and interpretation of the importance, responsibility for, or relevance of ACP itself. Family physicians may be uniquely placed to leverage the longitudinal, person- centred relationship they have with patients to mitigate some of these barriers.",2020-05-25,BMC Family Practice,https://openalex.org/V153257185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,,,21,1,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031024004,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,journal-article,3031024004

Our comparison of models focuses on density forecasts. Over a range of dynamic models, oil shock measures and data, we find a robust link between oil shocks and the volatility of economic growth. We then develop a new measure of oil shocks and show that it is superior to existing measures; it indicates that the conditional variance of growth increases in response to an indicator of the local maximum oil price exceedance. The empirical results uncover a large pronounced asymmetric response of the growth volatility to oil price changes.

Objectives To propose a comprehensive definition of SMM, to create an empirically justified list of SMM types and subtypes, and to use this to examine SMM in Canada. Methods Severe maternal morbidity was defined as a set of heterogeneous maternal conditions known to be associated with severe illness and with prolonged hospitalisation or high case fatality. Candidate SMM types/subtypes were evaluated using information on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebec), 2006-2015. SMM rates for 2012-2016 were quantified as a composite and as SMM types/subtypes. Rate ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with overall and specific SMM types/subtypes were estimated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS >  days) and case fatality. Results There were 2 79 cases of SMM subtypes (among  41 54 deliveries) that were associated with a prolonged LOS or high case fatality. Between 201 and 2016, the composite SMM rate was 16.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.9, 16.3) per 100 deliveries. Severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (514.6 per 100 00 deliveries), and severe postpartum haemorrhage (433.2 per 10 00 deliveries) were the most common SMM types, while case fatality rates among SMM subtypes were highest among women who had cardiac arrest and resuscitation (241.1 per 1000), hepatic failure (147.1 per 1000), dialysis (67.6 per 1000), and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (51.0 per 1000). The PAF for prolonged hospital stay related to SMM was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.3), while the PAF for maternal death associated with SMM was 88.0% (95% CI 74.6, 94.4). Conclusions The proposed definition of SMM and associated list of SMM subtypes could be used for standardised SMM surveillance, with rate ratios and PAFs associated with specific SMM types/subtypes serving to inform clinical practice and public health policy.",2020-07-01,Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology,https://openalex.org/V134018196,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12574,427,439,34,4,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968579279,https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12574,journal-article,2968579279

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and not fully understood. A combination of pathophysiology, patient and surgical risk factors increase the risk of postoperative VTE in these patients. Despite being at increased risk, IBD patients are not regularly prescribed extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis following colorectal surgery. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidelines. Thus, the aim of this review is to evaluate the role of extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in IBD patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Method A search of Ovid Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases was performed. A qualitative analysis was performed using 1 clinical questions developed by colorectal surgeons and a thrombosis haematologist. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized to assess the quality of evidence. Results A total of 122 studies were identified, 3 of which met the final inclusion criteria (37 retrospective, one case-control). Rates of postoperative VTE ranged between 0.6% and 8.9%. Patient-specific risk factors for postoperative VTE included ulcerative colitis, increased age and obesity. Surgery-specific risk factors for postoperative VTE included open surgery, emergent surgery and ileostomy creation. Patients with IBD were more frequently at increased risk in the included studies for postoperative VTE than patients with colorectal cancer. The risk of bias assessment demonstrated low risk of bias in patient selection and comparability, with variable risk of bias in reported outcomes. Conclusion There is a lack of evidence regarding the use of extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients with IBD following colorectal surgery.

We sought to develop the Canada Lymph Node Score a tool capable of predicting LN metastasis at the time of EBUS. <h3>Methods</h3> Patients undergoing EBUS staging for lung and esophageal cancer were prospectively enrolled. Features were identified in real time by an endoscopist and video-recorded. Videos were sent to raters. Pathologic specimens from biopsies/surgical resections were used as the gold-standard reference test. Logistic regression, receiver operator characteristic curve, and Gwet's AC1 analyses were used to test the performance, discrimination, and inter-rater reliability, respectively. <h3>Results</h3> In total, 30 LNs from 14 patients were analyzed by 1 endoscopists (raters) across  Canadian centers.

However, direct comparison of the skeletal muscle adaptations to low-load resistance exercise (LL-RE) and low-load BFR resistance exercise (LL-BFR) performed to task failure is lacking. Using a within-subject design, we examined whole muscle group and skeletal muscle adaptations to  wk of LL-RE and LL-BFR training to repetition failure. Muscle strength and size outcomes were similar for both types of training, despite ~33% lower total exercise volume (load × repetition) with LL-BFR than LL-RE (28,544 ± 1,77 vs. 18,949 ± 1,54 kg, P = 0.004). After training, only LL-BFR improved the average power output throughout the midportion of a voluntary muscle endurance task. Specifically, LL-BFR training sustained an 18% greater power output from baseline and resulted in a greater change from baseline than LL-RE (1 ± 3 vs. 3 ±  W, P = 0.008). This improvement occurred despite histological analysis revealing similar increases in capillary content of type I muscle fibers following LL-RE and LL-BFR training, which was primarily driven by increased capillary contacts (4.53 ± 0.2 before training vs. 5.3 ± 0.2 and 5.1 ± 0.2 after LL-RE and LL-BFR, respectively, both P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, maximally supported mitochondrial respiratory capacity increased only in the LL-RE leg by 30% from baseline  P = 0.006).

We evaluated trends of resection for synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases and associated patient outcomes. This is a retrospective cohort study that included patients undergoing resection for synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases from 200 to 201 in the province of Ontario, Canada (population 1 million). Simultaneous resections occurred on the same admission, while staged resections occurred less than  months apart. Outcomes included postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and overall survival. Kaplan Meier survival estimates, Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression were used. Among 2,738 patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases, 116 (42%) had synchronous disease. Of these, 44 resections were simultaneous (38%) and 77 were staged (62%). The proportion of synchronous disease among patients undergoing resection increased on average 3% per year (p = 0.02). For simultaneous versus staged resection, respectively, median length of hospital stay was shorter ( vs. 1 days, p < 0.001); rate of major liver resections was lower (17% vs. 65%, p < 0.001), major postoperative complications were similar (28% vs. 23%, p = 0.067), and 90-day post-operative mortality was higher (6% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). Chemotherapy was administered more commonly among patients undergoing staged resections (91% vs. 76%, p < 0.001).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in AF patients comparing the effect of lower versus standard INR targets on thromboembolism, major bleeding, and mortality. Methods We searched Western databases including Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, and Embase as well as Chinese databases including SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang Data. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random-effects model. We grouped INR targets in two ways: (1) any study-specific lower versus standard targets and (2) INR ranges of approximately 1.5 to 2 versus 2 to 3. Results Seventy-nine RCTs (n = 12,928) met eligibility criteria:  (n = 11,322) from East Asia and  (n = 1,606) from Western countries. Compared with standard targets, lower INR ranges were associated with higher rates of thromboembolism (7 RCTs, n = 12,577: 7.1% vs. 4.4%, RR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–1.74, I 2 = 0%), lower rates of major bleeding (6 RCTs, n = 10,815: 2.2% vs. 4.4%, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.44–0.67, I 2 = 0%), and similar mortality (3 RCTs, n = 7,327: 4.8% vs. 5.2%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85–1.19, I 2 = 0%). Results were similar when comparing target ranges of approximately 1.5 to 2 versus 2 to 3. Conclusion Moderate quality evidence suggests lower INR targets reduce bleeding but increase thromboembolism in AF.

Unstable BUE can damage the cutting tool edge and adversely affect the machined workpiece surface. However, stable BUE formation can protect the cutting tool surface from further wear, improving the productivity of AISI 30 stainless steel machining. This research proposes a new approach for monitoring and classification of BUE formation with 17 sets of turning experimental tests at different cutting speeds and wear states. The Daubechies wavelet transform is used to differentiate the BUE formation signals from the tool wear signals at different cutting velocities. The acquired acoustic emission (AE) and cutting force signals were filtered using both discrete wavelet, and wavelet packet transforms. Then, wavelet coefficients were processed in both the time and frequency domains with various features being extracted.

The flavonoid nobiletin displays potent lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing properties in mice with metabolic dysfunction. However, the mechanisms by which nobiletin mediates metabolic protection are not clearly established. The central role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as an energy sensor suggests that AMPK is a target of nobiletin. We tested the hypothesis that metabolic protection by nobiletin required phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in mouse hepatocytes, in mice deficient in hepatic AMPK (Ampkβ1-/-), in mice incapable of inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC (AccDKI), and in mice with adipocyte-specific AMPK deficiency (iβ1β2AKO). We fed mice a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet with or without nobiletin. Nobiletin increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in primary mouse hepatocytes, which was associated with increased FA oxidation and attenuated FA synthesis. Despite loss of ACC phosphorylation in Ampkβ1-/- hepatocytes, nobiletin suppressed FA synthesis and enhanced FA oxidation. Acute injection of nobiletin into mice did not increase phosphorylation of either AMPK or ACC in liver. In mice fed a high-fat diet, nobiletin robustly prevented obesity, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, and it improved energy expenditure in Ampkβ1-/-, AccDKI, and iβ1β2AKO mice to the same extent as in WT controls. Thus, the beneficial metabolic effects of nobiletin in vivo are conferred independently of hepatic or adipocyte AMPK activation. These studies further underscore the therapeutic potential of nobiletin and begin to clarify possible mechanisms.",2020-01-21,Journal of Lipid Research,https://openalex.org/V11400418,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.ra119000542,387,402,61,3,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001857422,https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.ra119000542,journal-article,3001857422

Generating accurate climate prediction at finer spatial resolution through downscaling could help better assess the future effects of climate change on a local scale. Ensembles of multiple climate models have been proven to improve the accuracy of temperature prediction. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques have shown high performance in solving various predictive modeling problems, which make them a promising tool for temperature downscaling. This study investigated the performance of machine learning (long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM)) and statistical (arithmetic ensemble mean (EM) and multiple linear regression (MLR)) methods in developing multi-model ensembles for downscaling long-term daily temperature. A case study of twelve meteorological stations across Ontario, Canada, was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensembles. The results showed that both machine learning and statistical techniques performed well at downscaling daily temperature with multi-model ensembles and had similar performance with relatively high accuracy. The R2 of 12 stations ranged between 0.75 and 0.82 and RMSE ranged between 4.318 and 7.063 °C. Both machine learning and statistical ensembles for downscaling had difficulty in predicting extreme values for temperature below − 10 °C and above 20 °C.

Despite cost and safety implications, there are few studies directly comparing these techniques and table choice remains largely surgeon preference. The purpose of this review was to compare the clinical outcomes and complication profiles of traction and standard table DAA for primary THA.The authors searched databases for relevant studies, screening in duplicate. Study quality was assessed using MINORS criteria or Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data pertaining to patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and complications were abstracted.Of 308 initial titles, 4 studies containing a total 26,353 patients were included and analysed. Mean operative time was 70.9 ± 21.2 minutes for standard table (n = 4402) and 100.1 ± 32.6 minutes for traction table (n = 3518). Mean estimated blood loss was 382.3 ± 246.4 mL for standard (n = 2992) and 531.7 ± 364.3 mL for traction table (n = 2675). Intra-operative fracture rate was 1.3% for standard table (n = 3940) and 1.7% for traction table (n = 8386). Complication rates including revisions, dislocations and peri-prosthetic fractures were qualitatively similar between traction and standard table studies.Standard table and traction table DAA have similar outcomes and complications. Both techniques offer the short-term advantages of DAA when compared to other THA approaches. However, the standard table technique may offer perioperative advantages including decreased blood loss, shorter operative time, and fewer intraoperative fractures. In the context of rising global healthcare costs and lack of access to specialised orthopaedic traction tables, this review at minimum confirms the short-term safety of standard table DAA THA and prompts the need for future studies to directly compare these techniques.",2020-01-29,Hip International,https://openalex.org/V176044460,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019900987,662,672,30,6,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004336672,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019900987,journal-article,3004336672

All treatment modalities can jeopardize nutritional status with potentially adverse effects on clinical outcomes. Accurate assessment of nutritional status and nutrient balance is essential, with remedial interventions delivered promptly when required. Children with cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are especially disadvantaged with concomitant challenges in the provision of nutritional support. Cost-effective advances in the form of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) may offer solutions. Studies in LMICs have defined a critical role for the gut microbiome in the causation of undernutrition in children and have demonstrated a beneficial effect of selected RUTF in redressing the imbalanced microbiota and improving nutritional status. Challenges in high-income countries relate both to concerns about the potential disadvantage of preexisting obesity in those newly diagnosed and to undernutrition identified at diagnosis and during treatment.

The interactions among individuals can often create population dynamics that are fundamentally deterministic yet display unpredictable dynamics. Animal populations can, therefore, be thought of as complex systems. Complex systems display properties such as nonlinearity and uncertainty and show emergent properties that cannot be explained by a simple sum of the interacting components. Any system where entities compete, cooperate, or interfere with one another may possess such qualities, making animal populations similar on many levels to complex systems. Some fields are already embracing elements of complexity to help understand the dynamics of animal populations, but a wider application of complexity science in ecology and evolution has not occurred. We review here how approaches from complexity science could be applied to the study of the interactions and behavior of individuals within animal populations and highlight how this way of thinking can enhance our understanding of population dynamics in animals. We focus on 8 key characteristics of complex systems: hierarchy, heterogeneity, self-organization, openness, adaptation, memory, nonlinearity, and uncertainty. For each topic we discuss how concepts from complexity theory are applicable in animal populations and emphasize the unique insights they provide.

The SAC-SMA and GR4J models perform equally well and perform better than the other three models for all low, medium, and peak flows. The SAC-SMA and GR4J models generally perform better for peak flows, followed by HEC-HMS. Streamflow forecast experiment using deterministic weather prediction shows that SAC-SMA, GR4J, and HEC-HMS models perform well for up to 1–3 days ahead forecasts and are recommended for operational use.

During hybridization, divergent genomes and alleles are brought together into the same cell, potentiating adaptation by increasing genomic plasticity. Here, we review hybridization in fungi by focusing on two fungal pathogens of animals. Hybridization is common between the basidiomycete yeast species Cryptococcus neoformans × Cryptococcus deneoformans, and hybrid genotypes are frequently found in both environmental and clinical settings. The two species show 10–15% nucleotide divergence at the genome level, and their hybrids are highly heterozygous. Though largely sterile and unable to mate, these hybrids can propagate asexually and generate diverse genotypes by nondisjunction, aberrant meiosis, mitotic recombination, and gene conversion. Under stress conditions, the rate of such genetic changes can increase, leading to rapid adaptation. Conversely, in hybrids formed between lineages of the chytridiomycete frog pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the parental genotypes are considerably less diverged (0.2% divergent). Bd hybrids are formed from crosses between lineages that rarely undergo sex. A common theme in both species is that hybrids show genome plasticity via aneuploidy or loss of heterozygosity and leverage these mechanisms as a rapid way to generate genotypic/phenotypic diversity. Some hybrids show greater fitness and survival in both virulence and virulence-associated phenotypes than parental lineages under certain conditions. These studies showcase how experimentation in model species such as Cryptococcus can be a powerful tool in elucidating the genotypic and phenotypic consequences of hybridization.",2020-01-16,Genes,https://openalex.org/V194631498,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11010101,101,101,11,1,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000375570,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11010101,journal-article,3000375570

Wildfire represents the largest disturbance to these ecosystems. Peatland resilience depends greatly on the extent of post-fire peat soil hydrophobicity. Climate change is altering wildfire intensity and severity and consequently impacting post-fire peat soil chemistry and structure. However, research on fire-impacted peatlands has rarely considered the influence of peat soil chemistry and structure on peatland resilience. Here we characterized the geochemical and physical properties of natural peat soils under laboratory heating conditions. The general trend observed is that hydrophilic peat soils become hydrophobic under moderate heating and then become hydrophilic again after heating for longer, or at higher, temperatures. The loss of peat soil hydrophilicity initially occurs due to evaporative water loss (25 °C and 300 °C for <5 min). Gently but thoroughly dried peat soils (10 °C for 2 h) also show mass losses after heating, indicating the loss of organic compounds through thermal degradation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the chemistry of unburned and 300 °C burned peat soils, and various fatty acids, polycyclic compounds, saccharides, aromatic acids, short-chain molecules, lignin and carbohydrates were identified. We determined that the heat-induced degradation of polycyclic compounds and aliphatic hydrocarbons, especially fatty acids, caused dried, hydrophobic peat soils to become hydrophilic after only 2 min of heating at 300 °C. Furthermore, peat soils became hydrophilic more quickly (2 min vs  h) with an increase in heat from 25 °C to 300 °C.

However, there is little research on the integration of PROs in “real-world” oncology practices using implementation science methods.

We searched  databases to February 2019. Paired reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and performed risk of bias assessment. The outcome of interest was painful response measured through tactile, cold, and air stimuli. We conducted a random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis using standardized mean difference (SMD) and their credible intervals (CIs) as the measure of effect for each pain stimuli. We assessed certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We included 12 RCTs (12,541 patients). For tactile stimulus, the following active ingredients showed large beneficial effects compared to fluoride with moderate certainty of evidence (SMD; 95% CI): potassium + stannous fluoride (SnF 2 ) (3.05; 1.69–4.41), calcium sodium phosphosilicate (CSP) (2.14; 0.75–3.53), SnF 2 (2.02; 1.06–2.99), potassium + hydroxyapatite (2.47; 0.3–4.64), strontium (1.43; 0.46–2.41), and potassium (1.23; 0.48–1.98).

This feature comes with a number of advantages including complete resistance to exonuclease degradation, much better thermodynamic stability, and the capability of being replicated by a DNA polymerase in a rolling circle manner. Circular functional nucleic acids, CNAs containing at least a ribozyme/DNAzyme or a DNA/RNA aptamer, not only inherit the advantages of CNAs but also offer some unique application opportunities, such as the design of topology-controlled or enabled molecular devices. This article will begin by summarizing the discovery, biogenesis, and applications of naturally occurring CNAs, followed by discussing the methods for constructing artificial CNAs. The exploitation of circular functional nucleic acids for applications in nanodevice engineering, biosensing, and drug delivery will be reviewed next.

At high altitude, where low O2 availability and persistent cold prevail, maximum metabolic heat production (thermogenesis) is an aerobic performance trait that is closely linked to survival. Understanding how thermogenesis evolves to enhance survival at high altitude will yield insight into the links between physiology, performance, and fitness. Recent work in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) has shown that adult mice native to high altitude have higher thermogenic capacities under hypoxia compared with lowland conspecifics, but that developing high-altitude pups delay the onset of thermogenesis. This finding suggests that natural selection on thermogenic capacity varies across life stages. To determine the mechanistic cause of this ontogenetic delay, we analyzed the transcriptomes of thermoeffector organs—brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle—in developing deer mice native to low and high altitude. We demonstrate that the developmental delay in thermogenesis is associated with adaptive shifts in the expression of genes involved in nervous system development, fuel/O2 supply, and oxidative metabolism pathways. Our results demonstrate that selection has modified the developmental trajectory of the thermoregulatory system at high altitude and has done so by acting on the regulatory systems that control the maturation of thermoeffector tissues. We suggest that the cold and hypoxic conditions of high altitude force a resource allocation tradeoff, whereby limited energy is allocated to developmental processes such as growth, versus active thermogenesis, during early development.",2020-08-01,Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V57552105,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa086,2309,2321,37,8,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014708574,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa086,journal-article,3014708574

These trapping devices include adhesive hyphae, adhesive knobs, adhesive networks, constricting rings, and non-constricting rings. Their diversity and practical importance have attracted significant attention from biologists, making them excellent model organisms for studying adaptative evolution and as biological control agents against parasitic nematodes. The putative origins and evolutionary relationships among these carnivorous fungi have been investigated using nuclear protein-encoding genes, but their patterns of mitogenome relationships and divergences remain unknown. Here we analyze and compare the mitogenomes of 12 fungal strains belonging to eight species, including six species representing all four types of nematode trapping devices and two from related but non-predatory fungi. All 12 analyzed mitogenomes were of circular DNA molecules, with lengths ranging from 146,101 bp to 280,699 bp. Gene synteny analysis revealed several gene rearrangements and intron transfers among the mitogenomes. In addition, the number of protein coding genes (PCGs), GC content, AT skew, and GC skew varied among these mitogenomes. The increased number and total size of introns were the main contributors to the length differences among the mitogenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of the protein-coding genes indicated that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes evolved at different rates, and signals of positive selection were found in several genes involved in energy metabolism.

Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) are widely consumed as “healthier” alternatives to sugar, yet recent evidence suggests NNS may adversely influence weight gain and metabolic health. The impact of NNS during critical periods of early development has rarely been studied. We investigated the effect of prenatal NNS exposure on postnatal adiposity and adipocyte development. In the CHILD birth cohort (N = 2298), we assessed maternal NNS beverage intake during pregnancy and child body composition at  years, controlling for maternal BMI and other potential confounders. To investigate causal mechanisms, we fed NNS to pregnant C57BL6J mice at doses relevant to human consumption (42 mg/kg/day aspartame or 6.3 mg/kg/day sucralose), and assessed offspring until 1 weeks of age for: body weight, adiposity, adipose tissue morphology and gene expression, glucose and insulin tolerance. We also studied the effect of sucralose on lipid accumulation and gene expression in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells. In the CHILD cohort, children born to mothers who regularly consumed NNS beverages had elevated body mass index (mean z-score difference +0.23, 95% CI 0.05–0.42 for daily vs. no consumption, adjusted for maternal BMI). In mice, maternal NNS caused elevated body weight, adiposity, and insulin resistance in offspring, especially in males (e.g., 47% and 15% increase in body fat for aspartame and sucralose vs. controls, p < 0.001). In cultured adipocytes, sucralose exposure at early stages of differentiation caused increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte differentiation genes (e.g., C/EBP-α, FABP4, and FASN). These genes were also upregulated in adipose tissue of male mouse offspring born to sucralose-fed dams. By triangulating evidence from humans, mice, and cultured adipocytes, this study provides new evidence that maternal NNS consumption during pregnancy may program obesity risk in offspring through effects on adiposity and adipocyte differentiation.",2020-05-04,International Journal of Obesity,https://openalex.org/V103428141,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-020-0575-x,2137,2148,44,10,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022593374,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-020-0575-x,journal-article,3022593374

Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, most Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This ""flattening of the curve"" has inevitably prompted discussions around reopening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent health care delivery. This document provides a template for cardiac surgical programs to begin to ramp-up the delivery of cardiac surgery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease that is guided by  principles. First, all recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, reprioritizing those with high-risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating. Finally, case volumes should be steadily increased in a mutually agreed upon fashion and must balance the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgery against the overall requirements of the health care system.",2020-07-01,Canadian Journal of Cardiology,https://openalex.org/V126162762,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,1139,1143,36,7,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023945391,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,journal-article,3023945391

Participants will undergo assessments measuring clinical outcomes using a battery of validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Sleep architecture and quality will be measured using polysomnography. Neuroimaging data will be collected using magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional and structural neurophysiological changes. Molecular data will be collected from blood, stool, and urine samples to examine cytokine levels and explore potential genes and proteins that may predict outcomes in depression.We expect results to replicate and expand on our pilot data demonstrating that probiotics may be effective in alleviating symptoms of depression, and to find biomarkers that will predict these outcomes.The findings from this study will add to the growing body of research in this emerging field, which eventually may provide evidence for probiotics having a role in alleviating symptoms of depression.",2020-01-01,Neuropsychobiology,https://openalex.org/V147539111,,https://doi.org/10.1159/000496406,108,116,79,1,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2912173274,https://doi.org/10.1159/000496406,journal-article,2912173274

The fragility index of studies from the Scandinavian knee ligament registries,"The fragility index (FI) is a metric to evaluate the robustness of statistically significant results. It describes the number of patients who would need to change from a non-event to an event to change a result from significant to non-significant. This systematic survey aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying the FI to findings related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the Scandinavian knee ligament registries.The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and AMED databases were searched. Studies from the Scandinavian knee ligament registers were eligible if they reported a statistically significant result (p < 0.05) for any of the following dichotomous outcomes; ACL revision, contralateral ACL reconstruction or the presence of postoperative knee laxity. Only studies with a two-arm comparative analysis were included. Eligibility assessment, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The dichotomous analyses were stratified according to the grouping variable for the two comparative arms as follows; age, patient sex, activity at injury, graft choice, drilling technique, graft fixation, single- versus double-bundle, concomitant cartilage injury and country. The two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the FI of all statistically significant analyses.From 15 identified studies, 1 studies were included. They reported statistical significance for a total of 56 dichotomous analyses, of which all but two had been determined by a time-to-event analysis. The median sample size for the arms was 554 (range 92-38,666). The mean FI for all 56 dichotomous analyses was 80.6 (median 34.5), which means that a mean of 80.6 patients were needed to change outcome status to generate a non-significant result instead of a significant one. Seventeen analyses (30.4%) immediately became non-significant when performing the two-sided Fisher's exact test and, therefore, had an FI of 0 The analyses related to age were the most robust, with a mean FI of 178.5 (median 116, range 1-1089). The mean FI of the other grouping variables ranged from 0. to 48.0.There was large variability in the FI in analyses from the Scandinavian knee ligament registries and almost one third of the analyses had an FI of zero. The FI is a rough measurement of robustness when applied to registry studies, however, future studies are needed to determine the most appropriate metric for robustness in registry studies.

The enhanced bacterial inactivation by the Cu(II)/PMS system appears to be due to the reactive oxidants produced by the catalytic reactions of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple with PMS. In the presence of chloride ion (Cl−), the Cu(II)/PMS system showed increased microbicidal effects on the planktonic P. aeruginosa cells, which was explained by the role of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) produced by the reaction of chloride with PMS. In addition, the combination of Cu(II) with HOCl showed synergistic microbicidal effects on the planktonic cells. Compared to planktonic cells, biofilm cells were more resistant to the Cu(II)/PMS treatment. Cl− did not significantly affect the inactivation of biofilm cells by the Cu(II)/PMS system. It is believed that the extracellular polymeric substances of biofilms play a role as oxidant sinks (particularly HOCl), protecting the cells inside the biofilm matrix.

Previous research studying Fukushima butterfly, Chernobyl bird and fruit fly populations shows that the effects are transgenerational, underlined by the principles of genomic instability, and varied from one species to another. To further expand on the responses of and their sensitivity in different taxonomically distinct groups, the present study sought to reconstruct historic radiation doses and delineate their effects on bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) found within a 400-km radius of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant meltdown site. Historic dose reconstruction from the whole-body dose rates for the bank vole samples for their parental generation at the time of radioactive release was performed. Relationships between the historic doses and cytogenetic aberrations and embryonic lethality were examined via graphical presentations. Results suggest that genomic instability develops at the historic dose range of 20-51 mGy while a radioadaptive response develops at the historic dose range of 51-356 mGy. The Linear No-Threshold (LNT) relationship was absent at historic doses of lower than 356 mGy at all generations. However, LNT was apparent when the very high historic dose of 10.28 Gy in one sampling year was factored into the dose response curve for the bank vole generation 21-22. It is worth being reminded that natural mutation accumulation and other environmental stressors outside the realm of dose effects could contribute to the observed effects in a multiple-stressor environment.

However, both transportation and power utility sectors retain various challenges in facilitating the seamless integration of battery electric bus (BEB) fleet systems. Among those challenges, the lack of appropriate simulation tools to model, design, and optimize BEB fleet systems is the most salient. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new mathematical formulation to model BEB fleet systems. The model considers the operational requirements of public bus transit systems and the energy consumption characteristics of BEBs. The proposed transit model is then integrated with the power distribution system model to develop an integrated utility-transit problem formulation for the optimal design of BEB systems. The formulated optimization problem aims at determining the optimal configuration parameters of BEB fleet systems that include the bus battery capacity, chargers rated power, and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. The developed utility-transit model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and is solved using the Basic Open-Source Nonlinear Mixed INteger Programming (BONMIN) optimization solver. Real-world transit system data are used to validate the efficacy of the proposed integrated utility-transit model. The simulation results indicate that consideration of both power distribution and transit networks operation requirements significantly impact the choice of the BEBs configuration.",2020-03-01,IEEE Systems Journal,https://openalex.org/V95999327,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2019.2926460,738,748,14,1,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983944635,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2019.2926460,journal-article,2983944635

Here, we used a high-throughput method (<4 min/sample) based on multisegment injection-nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-NACE-MS) to investigate whether specific serum NEFAs have utility as biomarkers of dietary fat intake in women. We first identified circulating NEFAs correlated with long-term/habitual food intake among pregnant women with contrasting dietary patterns (n = 50). Acute changes in serum NEFA trajectories were also studied in nonpregnant women (n = 18) following high-dose (5 g/day) fish oil (FO) supplementation or isoenergetic sunflower oil placebo over 5 days. In the cross-sectional study, serum ω-3 FAs correlated with self-reported total ω-3 daily intake, notably EPA as its NEFA (r = 0.46; P = 0.001), whereas pentadecanoic acid was associated with full-fat dairy intake (r = 0.43; P = 0.002), outcomes consistent with results from total FA serum hydrolysates. In the intervention cohort, serum ω-3 NEFAs increased 2.5-fold from baseline within 2 days following FO supplementation, and this increase was most pronounced for EPA (P = 0.0004). Unlike for DHA, circulating EPA as its NEFA also strongly correlated to EPA concentrations measured from erythrocyte phospholipid hydrolysates (r = 0.66; P = 4.6 × 10-10) and was better suited to detect dietary nonadherence.

It is currently estimated that 381 million children worldwide have overweight or obesity. This disease stems from multiple complex pathways that can present early in life. This is particularly concerning because childhood obesity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors that can lead to early atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and systemic inflammation are associated with vascular changes in childhood, and these contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular events in adulthood if not adequately treated. Interventions to treat childhood obesity include multicomponent family-based behaviour modification programs, which have been demonstrated to have moderate short-term effects on weight-related outcomes; their effects on cardiovascular risk factors, however, are less well understood. Although supervised, structured exercise interventions result in improvements in blood pressure, inflammation, carotid artery intima media thickness, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction in children with obesity in the short term, our understanding of how to translate these interventions into long-term sustainable exercise or physical activity recommendations remains uncertain.

Ground segmentation plays an important role in the sequence of data processing for environment perception tasks, as it can help to reduce the size of data to be processed and further decrease the overall computational time. However, the over-segmentation, under-segmentation, or slow-segmentation on non-flat surface usually occurs due to the characteristics of the 3D LIDAR data, such as occlusion in complex urban environment.

We show that in a large class of translation-invariant models the correlation functions factorize at late times $\langle A(t) B\rangle_\beta \rightarrow \langle A \rangle_\beta \langle B \rangle_\beta$, thus proving that dissipation emerges out of the unitary dynamics of the system. We also show that for systems with a generic spectrum the fluctuations around this late-time value are bounded by the purity of the thermal ensemble, which generally decays exponentially with system size. For auto-correlation functions we provide an upper bound on the timescale at which they reach the factorized late time value. Remarkably, this bound is only a function of local expectation values, and does not increase with system size. We give numerical examples that show that this bound is a good estimate in non-integrable models, and argue that the timescale that appears can be understood in terms of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

2020,5,3,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2971562957,Entropy-driven winds: Outflows and fountains lifted gently by buoyancy,"We present a new theoretical framework for using entropy to understand how outflows driven by supernovae are launched from disc galaxies: via continuous, buoyant acceleration through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). When young star clusters detonate supernovae in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy, they generate hot, diffuse bubbles that push on the surrounding ISM and evaporate that ISM into their interiors. As these bubbles reach the scale height of the ISM, they break out of the disc, rising into the CGM. Once these bubbles break out, if they have sufficiently high entropy, they will feel an upward acceleration, owing to a local buoyant force. This upward force will accelerate these bubbles, driving them to high galactocentric radii, keeping them in the CGM for $>\Gyr$, even if their initial velocity is much lower than the local escape velocity. We derive an equation of motion for these entropy-driven winds that connects the ISM properties, halo mass, and CGM profile of galaxies to the ultimate evolution of feedback-driven winds. We explore the parameter space of these equations, and show how this novel framework can explain both self-consistent simulations of star formation and galactic outflows as well as the new wealth of observations of CGM kinematics. We show that these entropy-driven winds can produce long wind recycling times, while still carrying a significant amount of mass.

We sought to compare inpatient complications and costs of anterior (ACDF) versus posterior cervical decompression and fusion (PCDF).Patients who underwent multilevel ACDF or PCDF for DCM were identified from the National Inpatient Sample for 2004-2014 using ICD-9-CM codes. Propensity score matching was performed with age, sex, comorbidities, hospital bed size, and use of intraoperative monitoring as covariates.

We uncovered evidence in different species for 1) an ancestral W chromosome that is not found in many females and is found in some males, 2) independent losses and 3) autosomal segregation of this W chromosome, 4) changes in male versus female heterogamy, and 5) substantial variation among species in recombination suppression on sex chromosomes. We further provide evidence of, and evolutionary context for, the origins of at least seven distinct systems for regulating sex determination among three closely related genera. These systems are distinct in their genomic locations, evolutionary origins, and/or male versus female heterogamy.

To date, policy makers and industry actors have avoided confronting the impending gap, a consequence of the fact that current levels of vehicle autonomy are sufficiently low that accountability for decision-making affecting the operation of vehicles still resides with the driver. However, as automotive firms achieve higher levels of vehicle autonomy and control shifts to the vehicle itself and the infrastructure supporting it, the preponderance of responsibility will transfer to different actors: automotive firms, autonomous vehicle programmers, and policy makers. This article explains and quantifies the challenges that will arise as that process unfolds. It does this by introducing four ethics and value-based foundations that can be used to guide programming of decisions to be made by autonomous vehicles. The purpose is not to recommend a specific ethics or value-based foundation for programming high level autonomous vehicles. Rather, by programming dilemma-inducing scenarios and then directing outcomes on the basis of distinct ethical or values-based foundations, we quantifiably demonstrate that autonomous vehicle programming decisions, whether they are guided by a particular ethical foundation or moral code or not, manifest in tangibly different outcomes.

We aimed to determine the incidence of intracranial bleeding among all senior patients who present to ED after a fall.We performed a systematic review. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects databases, Google Scholar, bibliographies and conference abstracts were searched for articles relevant to senior ED patients who presented after a ground-level fall. Studies were included if they reported on patients aged 6 or older who had fallen. At least 80% of the population had to have suffered a ground-level fall. There were no language restrictions. We performed a meta-analysis (using the random effects model) to report the pooled incidence of intracranial bleeding within  weeks of the fall.We identified eleven studies (including 11,102 patients) addressing this clinical question. Only three studies were prospective in design.

Previous work posited a dendrite orientation transition via compositional additions. In this work we examine experimentally the change in dendrite growth behaviour in the Al-Sm (Samarium) system as a function of solute concentration and study its interfacial properties using molecular dynamics simulations. We observe a dendrite growth direction which changes from <100> to <110> as Sm content increases. The observed change in dendrite orientation is consistent with the simulation results for the variation of the interfacial free energy anisotropy and thus provides definitive confirmation of conjecture in previous works.

Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS is well-established; however, the long-term results in elite athletes are limited. Purpose: To evaluate outcomes 5 years after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Elite athletes undergoing arthroscopic treatment for FAIS with a minimum 5-year follow-up were included. They were prospectively followed up with patient-reported outcome measures. An elite athlete was defined as having a Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) level of  or  before the onset of symptoms. Preoperatively and 5 years after surgery, all athletes completed a web-based questionnaire, including the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (comprising 6 subscales), the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS (European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions Questionnaire and European Quality of Life–Visual Analog Scale), iHOT-12 (International Hip Outcome Tool), a visual analog scale for hip function, and the HSAS. Moreover, patients reported their overall satisfaction with their hip function. Preoperative measurements were compared with the 5-year follow-up. Results: A total of 6 elite athletes (5 men, 1 women) with a mean ± SD age of  ± 6 years were included.

At the 5-year follow-up, 90.5% reported satisfaction with their overall hip function. In total, 54% still participated in competitive sports (HSAS, 5-8) at follow-up, while 77% had decreased their level. Older patients and patients with longer duration of symptoms reported a significantly lower level of sports activity (HSAS, 0-4; P &lt; .009). Conclusion: Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes results in a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement regarding symptoms, hip function, quality of life, and pain 5 years after surgery.

The dominant lineage is Cryptococcus neoformans which consists of three haploid clades VNI, VNII, and VNB, their haploid hybrids, and various diploids derived from intra- and inter-clade mating events. In this study, we analyzed the mitogenomes of 184 strains of C. neoformans. Our analyses revealed that all 184 mitogenomes contained the same 15 protein-coding genes in the same gene order. However, their mitogenome sizes varied between 24,740 and 31,327 bp, primarily due to differences in the number and size of mitochondrial introns. Twelve nucleotide sites within five mitochondrial genes were found to contain introns in at least one of the 184 strains, ranging from  to  introns within each mitogenome. The concatenated mitochondrial exon sequences of the 15 protein-coding genes and two rRNA genes showed that VNI, VNII, and VNB strains were separated into distinct clades or sub-clades, largely consistent with results based on nuclear genome SNPs. However, several novel findings were observed. First, one strain of the VNB clade contained mitogenome exon sequences identical to the main VNI mitogenome type but was distant to other VNB mitogenomes. Second, hybrids among clades VNI, VNII, and VNB identified based on their nuclear genome SNPs contained mitogenomes from different clades, with evidence of their mitogenomes inherited from either the MATa or the MATα parents. Third, the eight diploid VNB (C. neoformans) × VNIV (C. deneoformans) hybrids contained recombinant mitogenomes. Fourth, analyses of intron distribution and the paired exon-intron phylogenies for each of the 1 exon-intron pairs suggested frequent gains and losses of mitochondrial introns during the evolution of C. neoformans. The combined mitogenome exon-based phylogeny and intron distributions suggested that clades VNI, VNII and VNB could be further divided into sub-clades.

Such tears account for 12–35% of all tear patterns and can be treated by partial meniscectomy or arthroscopic repair. The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the outcomes and complications for patients undergoing the surgical treatment of HCTs. This review has been conducted according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. The electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from data inception to December 30, 201 for articles addressing the surgical treatment of HCTs. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies was used to assess study quality. Data are presented descriptively. Overall, 2 studies were identified, comprising of 70 patients (708 knees) with a mean age of 36.6 ± 9.9 years and a mean follow-up of 33.6 ± 19.6 months. The majority of patients were treated with a partial meniscectomy (59.0%), followed by repair (32.8%) and total meniscectomy (8.2%). Both meniscectomy and repair patients had improvements which surpassed minimal clinically important differences with regard to clinical (e.g. pain, function, daily living) and radiographic outcomes. The overall complication rate was 5.1%, primarily involving patients undergoing meniscal repair (12.9% of all knees undergoing a repair). Although meniscal repair theoretically may provide improvement in biomechanical loading, patients undergoing repair had higher complication rates than those undergoing partial meniscectomy.

A mixture of contaminated Gaussian factor analyzers (MCGFA) model follows therefrom, and extends the recently proposed mixture of contaminated Gaussian distributions to high-dimensional data. We introduce a family of 32 parsimonious models formed by introducing constraints on the covariance and contamination structures of the general MCGFA model.

In this study, we compare the provincial administrative databases and illustrate the potential impact of database differences on a CNODES study about domperidone and the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (VT/SCD). Methods We assessed the impact of varying versions and precision of the International Classification of Diseases coding system in physician claims data, and the content and completeness of hospital discharge abstracts across CNODES sites, as these variations can introduce differences in the study cohorts formed and affect study results. Results In our study of 21 96 patients, hospital diagnosis type (such as most responsible, admitting, or secondary diagnosis) was missing in some provinces, resulting in misclassification of the outcome and variation in rates and risk estimates. Incidence rates of VT/SCD ranged from 19.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-22.2) per 1 00 person-years in British Columbia to 53.4 (95% CI 50.3-56.5) in Quebec. While most provinces reported an increased risk of VT/SCD, a null effect was observed in Quebec (rate ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.79-1.41).

In Mycobacteria tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis, biotin biosynthesis is a key fitness determinant during infection2-5, making it a high-priority target. However, biotin biosynthesis has been overlooked for priority pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can be attributed to the lack of attenuation observed for biotin biosynthesis genes during transposon mutagenesis studies in mouse infection models6-9. Previous studies did not consider the 40-fold higher concentration of biotin in mouse plasma compared to human plasma. Here, we leveraged the unique affinity of streptavidin to develop a mouse infection model with human levels of biotin. Our model suggests that biotin biosynthesis is essential during infection with A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Encouragingly, we establish the capacity of our model to uncover in vivo activity for the biotin biosynthesis inhibitor MAC13772.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Rationale: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is an undesirable complication of severe obesity. Although weight loss is an accepted component of management, it is difficult to achieve and sustain the degree of weight loss necessary to reverse OHS. As such, positive airway pressure (PAP) during sleep has become the cornerstone therapy for most patients with OHS. However, the value of PAP therapy remains uncertain.Objective: To perform a systematic review to determine whether adults with OHS should be treated with PAP therapy or not.Methods: This systematic review informed an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts who had converged to develop a clinical practice guideline on OHS for the American Thoracic Society. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched from January 194 to March 201 for studies that compared PAP therapy (i.e., continuous PAP or noninvasive ventilation) to no PAP therapy in patients with OHS. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to appraise the quality of evidence.Results: The search identified 2,994 unique articles. The full text of 5 articles was reviewed, and 2 studies were selected, including  randomized trials, 1 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 1 randomized and nonrandomized studies without a comparator group. Sample size ranged from 2 to 1,527 patients. PAP was associated with increased resolution of OHS and improvements in mortality, gas exchange, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, quality of life, and emergency department visits. Nearly half of patients experienced trivial adverse effects related to PAP therapy. Certainty in the estimated effects was low or very low for most outcomes.Conclusions: The panel made a conditional (i.e., weak) recommendation that PAP therapy during sleep be offered to patients with OHS to improve outcomes. This recommendation was based on very low-quality evidence.",2020-02-28,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://openalex.org/V4210233309,American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201907-528oc,,,,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987105405,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201907-528oc,journal-article,2987105405

CAPNONs can mimic calcified meningiomas at the skull base. Methods: Here, we report two cases of CAPNON and present a systematic review of the literature on skull base CAPNONs, to compare CAPNONs with calcified meningiomas. Results: Case 1: A 57-year-old man presented with right-sided lower cranial neuropathies and gait ataxia. He underwent a subtotal resection of a right cerebellopontine angle lesion, with significant improvement of his gait ataxia. However, his cranial neuropathies persisted. Pathological examination of the lesion was diagnostic of CAPNON, with the entrapped nerve fibers identified at the periphery of the lesion, correlating with the patient’s cranial neuropathy. Case 2: A 70-year-old man presented with progressive headache, gait difficulty, and cognitive impairment. He underwent a frontotemporal craniotomy for a near-total resection of his right basal frontal CAPNON. He remained neurologically stable  years after the initial resection without evidence of disease recurrence. We analyzed 2 reported CAPNONs at the skull base in our systematic review of the literature. Cranial neuropathies were present in 1 (45.8%) patients. Outcomes regarding cranial neuropathies were documented in six patients: two had sacrifice of the nerve function with surgical approaches and four had persistent cranial neuropathies. Conclusion: While CAPNON can radiologically and grossly mimic calcified meningiomas, they are two distinctly different pathologies.

Few studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on functional performance, posture, and other outcomes that are important to patients after vertebral fractures. Objective This pilot study will explore the effect of home exercise versus control on functional performance, posture, and patient-reported outcome measures. Design This study was a parallel 2-arm pilot feasibility trial with 1:1 randomization to exercise or attentional control groups. Setting This study took place in 5 Canadian and  Australian academic or community hospitals/centers. Participants This study included 14 women ≥6 years of age with radiographically confirmed vertebral fractures. Intervention A physical therapist delivered exercise and behavioral counseling in 6 home visits over  months and monthly calls. Participants were to exercise ≥ times weekly. Controls received equal attention. Measurements Functional performance, posture, quality of life, pain, and behavior-change outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 6 (questionnaires only) and 1 months. Adherence to exercise was assessed by calendar diary. All t tests examined between-group mean differences (MD) in change from baseline in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Results There was a small effect of exercise on 5 times sit-to-stand test versus control (MD = −1.5 [95% CI = −3.0 to −0.07], intention-to-treat; MD = −1.4 [95% CI = −3.1 to 0.16], per-protocol). There were no other major or statistically significant MDs for any other measured outcomes after follow-up. Adherence declined over time. Limitations Treatment effects on variables may have been underestimated due to multiple comparisons and underpowered analyses. Conclusions Our exploratory estimate of the effect of exercise on functional leg muscle strength was consistent in direction and magnitude with other trials in individuals with vertebral fractures.

Usage of antiscalants or pH adjustment can suppress scale formation on membranes without sacrificing overall recovery. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two different antiscalants (phosphonate-based and acrylic acid-based) and pH adjustment for the inhibition of scaling on polyamide RO membranes during the separation of microfiltration (MF) treated secondary effluent wastewater. Product recovery was targeted at 50%, increasing the residual concentration of scale forming ions by a factor of 2 in the feed. Substantial scale formation, dominated by calcium carbonate, was observed during the separation of the feed. In the presence of antiscalants, calcium carbonate scaling was successfully abated, while iron based scalants did not significantly decrease. Phosphonate-based antiscalants were found to be more effective in inhibiting calcium carbonate scaling as compared to acrylic acid-based antiscalants. As such, RO membranes treated with phosphonate-based antiscalants demonstrated lower permeate flux decline and less calcium scale deposition on membrane surfaces under the tested conditions. The addition of a strong acid to control scaling is a less expensive alternative to antiscalant addition. pH adjustment using sulfuric acid was effective for the inhibition of calcium carbonate scaling. However, acid addition resulted in corrosion of piping leading to considerable leaching of iron and copper into the feed. The presence of iron and copper adversely increased the scaling potential of the membranes.",2020-06-01,Separation and Purification Technology,https://openalex.org/V69753523,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116549,116549,116549,240,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998778326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116549,journal-article,2998778326

During normal operation, these materials are exposed to a neutron flux in the core of the reactor, resulting in material degradation such as irradiation-induced anisotropic growth, thus affecting their performance in the long-term. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that irradiation-induced defects in zirconium lead to the formation of defect clusters and loops. The anisotropy in the migration of defects has been suggested to play an important role in irradiation growth in pure Zr and its alloys. However, the mechanisms that govern the microstructural evolution that lead to the observed anisotropic growth of Zr is still unclear. In the present work, we perform a molecular dynamics simulation study of irradiation-induced lattice defects in Zr to investigate the formation of clusters and loops. Irradiation-induced damage is modeled by constrained stochastic formation of vacancies and self-interstitial atoms in bulk Zr. Using this approach, the formation and evolution of defect clusters and loops were determined. The dynamic properties of lattice defect structures were investigated through the evaluation of their migration and diffusivity. We found that the diffusivity of vacancy and interstitial clusters is anisotropic and slow, while the diffusivity of large loops is relatively high and confined to the ⟨ a ⟩ plane.",2020-04-01,Journal of Nuclear Materials,https://openalex.org/V149516416,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2019.151979,151979,151979,531,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999697070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2019.151979,journal-article,2999697070

Our aim was to evaluate if associations between colonic motor patterns and autonomic neural activity could be demonstrated by assessing changes in heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy volunteers. A total of 14 colonic motor patterns were assessed in 1 healthy volunteers by High-Resolution Colonic Manometry (HRCM) using an 84-channel water-perfused catheter. Motor patterns were evoked by balloon distention, a meal and luminal bisacodyl. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac impedance were assessed during colonic manometry. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and root mean square of successive differences of beat-to-beat intervals (RMSSD) served as measures of parasympathetic reactivity while the Baevsky's Stress Index (SI) and the pre-ejection period (PEP) were used as measures of sympathetic reactivity. Taking all motor patterns into account, our data show that colonic motor patterns are accompanied by increased parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity that may occur without eliciting a significant change in heart rate. Motor Complexes (more than one motor pattern occurring in close proximity), High-Amplitude Propagating Pressure Waves followed by Simultaneous Pressure Waves (HAPW-SPWs) and HAPWs without SPWs are all associated with an increase in RSA and a decrease in SI. Hence RSA and SI may best reflect autonomic activity in the colon during these motor patterns as compared to RMSSD and PEP. SI and PEP do not measure identical sympathetic reactivity. The SPW, which is a very low amplitude pressure wave, did not significantly change the autonomic measures employed here. In conclusion, colonic motor patterns are associated with activity in the ANS which is reflected in autonomic measures of heart rate variability. These autonomic measures may serve as proxies for autonomic neural dysfunction in patients with colonic dysmotility.",2020-01-23,Frontiers in Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V115201632,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01447,,,,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001832315,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01447,journal-article,3001832315

Eligible articles were appraised using Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist and the Quality Appraisal for Clinical Measurement Research Reports Evaluation Form.The  eligible studies included participants with orthopedic lumbar spine impairments (n = 52,767), patients with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (n = 1944), patients with low back pain (n = 183) and individuals with upper extremity disorders (n = 151). Risk of bias was ranging from ""adequate"" to ""very good"" and quality was found excellent for all studies. Based on pooled data, test-retest reliability of 11-item GRoC for patients with low back pain was found excellent ICC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.94. Test-retest reliability in patients with shoulder pain was found fair to good ICC of 0.6 in a 15-point GRoC scale. Seven studies (n = 7) examined the convergent validity between GRoC and another outcome measure. Minimum important change on the Portuguese version of Global Perceived Effect (GPE) for patients with LBP was 2.5 points out of 1 points.The current pool of clinical measurement studies indicates that the GRoC has excellent test-retest reliability for patients with low back pain, shoulder pain and with lumbar spine disorders. However, the validity of it as a reference standard in responsiveness studies or as an accurate overall assessment of change has been questioned. While future studies might provide more insight into its measurement properties, this limitation is unlikely to change. Therefore, we suggest that future responsiveness in the studies that want a global indicator measure need to use an additional measure to mitigate recall bias.CRD 42020149122.",2020-02-10,Journal of orthopaedics,https://openalex.org/V2764834445,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2020.01.047,40,48,21,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005728586,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2020.01.047,journal-article,3005728586

Poor adherence to prescribed maintenance therapy and over-reliance on SABA reliever medication is a common cause of inadequate control. This article reviews published data from 6- to 12-month, double-blind, RCT and open-label real-world studies involving budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) and relevant comparator approaches to asthma management, and considers how these compare in achieving the treatment goals described in guidelines. The data confirm that patients with asthma treated with budesonide/formoterol MART achieved the same or better asthma symptom control compared with ICS/LABA plus SABA regimens at similar or higher ICS doses, with consistently lower rates of exacerbations and considerably lower annual requirement for oral corticosteroids. These findings have been confirmed across a range of severities of persistent asthma. With the MART approach, maintenance dosing ensures coverage for day-to-day control, and the use of a reliever with anti-inflammatory properties (budesonide/formoterol) provides extra doses of ICS as soon as symptoms prompt the use of reliever, resulting in a 40-50% reduction of exacerbations compared with an ICS-based treatment approach plus as-needed SABA as reliever. As-needed, budesonide/formoterol has also recently been shown to be more effective as a reliever in mild asthma than SABA alone, reducing exacerbations by up to 64% in the SYGMA studies.",2020-03-31,Respirology,https://openalex.org/V125119059,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13804,804,815,25,8,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014597926,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13804,journal-article,3014597926

Individuals with SCI (N = 20;  tetraplegia/11 paraplegia; time since injury, 14–182 days; age, 46 ± 16 years; 15 M/5 F) were randomized to SIT or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). SIT consisted of 3 × 20 s. ‘all-out’ cycle sprints (≥100% peak power output) interspersed with 2 min of active recovery (10% peak power output; total time commitment, 10 mins). MICT involved 20 min of cycling (45% peak power output; total time commitment, 25 mins). Both training interventions were delivered  times/week for  weeks. Heart rate and Borg’s Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE; 6–20) were monitored throughout training sessions. Maximal and sub-maximal power outputs were assessed on an arm-crank ergometer. Exercise enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and pain were assessed at the end of the intervention. During training sessions, heart rate (13 bpm vs. 11 bpm; p = 0.05), peripheral RPE (1 vs. 12; p = 0.000), and central RPE (1 vs. 11; p = 0.004) responses were higher in the SIT group, yet total work performed was greater in MICT. Peak power output increased significantly with training (36%), with no difference between groups (39% vs. 33%; p = 0.524). Similarly, improvements in sub-maximal power output were not different across groups. There were no between-group differences in exercise enjoyment (p = 0.385), exercise self-efficacy (p = 0.930), or pain (p = 0780). Five weeks of SIT improved physical capacity to the same extent as MICT in individuals with sub-acute SCI, despite a significantly lower time commitment with SIT.",2020-01-01,Spinal Cord,https://openalex.org/V95854419,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-019-0345-6,106,115,58,1,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970783943,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-019-0345-6,journal-article,2970783943

MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed were searched for relevant studies from database inception to September 18, 2018. All studies that evaluated RTSA in patients aged ≤65 years were included. Two independent reviewers screened all studies and performed a quality assessment. In the total of  studies reviewed, 24 participants underwent RTSA, with the most common indications being failed rotator cuff repair and rotator cuff tear arthropathy. Postoperative functional outcomes indicated a significant level of improvement across all reported outcomes at a mean follow-up of 4 months (range, 19-140 months) (P < .05). The pooled mean complication rate was 18% (n = 44/245), and this higher rate may be due to 36% of patients undergoing an RTSA for a failed arthroplasty procedure and the inclusion of older studies that lacked modern implants and techniques. Although there is a significant improvement in functional outcomes at midterm follow-up for RTSA in the patients aged ≤65 years, the pooled complication rates are high. However, the results of this systematic review are limited because of the heterogenous patient population undergoing surgery for various indications, including revision arthroplasty.

However, their low electrical conductivity and wide bandgap, particularly in the case of boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs), have given rise to severe limitations. Efforts on bandgap engineering through doping and surface functionalization have gained little success due to their high thermodynamic stability and inertness. Herein, we present a novel approach to functionalize BNQDs by hydroxyl, methyl, and amine functional groups aiming to adjust the electronic structure. The successful exfoliation is demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, and surface functionalization is elaborated by FTIR and XPS. Modifications of the electronic and optical properties are shown by UV–Vis and PL measurements. The formation of two absorption edges in bandgaps of BNQDs due to the delocalizing of the Px and Pz orbitals as result of edge/surface passivating groups is demonstrated. Splitting of the main transition bandgap of bulk BN from 5.9 eV to two absorption edges for hydroxyl (2.3-3.6 eV), methyl (3.2-4.2 eV), and amine (3.1-4 eV) is shown.

Recently, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) has implicated in SC regulation in animals. To date, little is known regarding the role of BDNF in human SC function in vivo. Twenty-nine males (age, 2 ± 0. years) participated in the study. Muscle biopsies from the thigh were obtained prior to a bout of 30 maximal eccentric contractions (Pre), and at  h, 24 h, 7 h, and 96 h postexercise. BDNF was not detected in any quiescent (Pax7 + /MyoD − ) SCs across the time-course. BDNF colocalized to 39% ± 5% of proliferating (Pax7 + /MyoD + ) cells at Pre, which increased to 84% ± 3% by 96 h (P &lt; 0.05). BDNF was only detected in 13% ± 5% of differentiating (Pax7 − /MyoD + ) cells at Pre, which increased to 67% ± 4% by 9 h (P &lt; 0.05). The number of myogenin + cells increased 95% from Pre (1.6 ± 0. cells/100 myofibres (MF)) at 24 h (3.1 ± 0. cells/100 MF) and remained elevated until 9 h (cells/100 MF), P &lt; 0.05.

The TSLP gene encodes two isoforms, long and short, and previous studies have indicated functional differences between these two isoforms. OBJECTIVE We investigated the expression of these TSLP isoforms in response to a pro-inflammatory signal, and the role of the rs1837253 genotype in gene isoform regulation. METHODS We cultured nasal epithelial cells of asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects and evaluated poly(I:C)-induced TSLP protein secretion using multiplex protein assays and gene expression profiles of the TSLP isoforms, and related genes using real-time qPCR. We correlated these profiles with rs1837253 genotype. RESULTS Asthmatic nasal epithelial cells exhibited increased TSLP protein secretion compared with nasal epithelial cells from healthy controls. The long TSLP isoform was more responsive to poly(I:C) stimulation. Additionally, the minor T allele of rs1837253 was less inducible than the major C allele, suggesting differential regulation; this may explain the protective effects of the T allele in asthma. CONCLUSION Our results provide important insights into the differential regulation and function of TSLP isoforms, including the role of TSLP rs1837253 polymorphisms in allergic inflammatory processes.

It plays a vital role in many renewable and CO2-reducing technologies which have a mismatch in time between when thermal energy is available and required. Water is the most commonly used thermal storage medium in many applications, however, for systems with a small temperature operating range, large storage volumes may be required since the energy storage capacity of water is proportional to the temperature range. In contrast, phase change materials (PCMs) can maintain high energy capacity under limited temperature conditions, but they typically have low thermal conductivities which results in slow melting/solidification rates. As such, careful design of the encapsulation geometry is required to take advantage of phase change thermal storage. Systems using phase change materials must ensure complete melting, and the encapsulation thickness must be designed according the system needs. Models of hybrid storage tanks employing both water and PCM are investigated, with PCM encapsulations embedded in water. This study uses a novel application of analytical formulations of 1-D melting to size rectangular PCM encapsulation to match the requirements of a residential heat pump system. With boundary conditions that reflect the heat pump and storage characteristics, the proposed analytical solution links encapsulation thickness to system requirements. The analytical formulation is derived for encapsulation thickness in terms of heat pump rating, temperature differential, storage material, and storage volume. The solution was verified through system-level numerical simulations using TRNSYS and an in-house enthalpy-porosity modeling tools detailed in the paper. The verifications have shown a good agreement, and the melt thickness predictions were within 4% between both models. The study proposes using the methodology as a standard for designing hybrid water-phase change material thermal storage for heat pumps, which can be expanded to various PCM geometries and thermal systems.",2020-04-01,Applied Thermal Engineering,https://openalex.org/V129676613,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.114978,114978,114978,170,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000851177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.114978,journal-article,3000851177

To promote quality of life without psychotropic effects, cannabinoids other than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabidiol, including cannabidiol and its precursor cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), are being evaluated. Due to its instability, CBDA has been understudied, particularly as an anti-nociceptive agent. Adding a methyl ester group (CBDA-ME) significantly enhances its stability, facilitating analyses of its analgesic effects in vivo. This study examines early treatment efficacy of CBDA-ME in a rat model of peripherally induced NEP and evaluates sex as a biological variable. Experimental approach After 1 consecutive days of intraperitoneal CBDA-ME administration at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 μg·kg-1 , commencing 1 day after surgically implanting a sciatic nerve-constricting cuff to induce NEP, the anti-nociceptive efficacy of this cannabinoid was assessed in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats relative to vehicle-treated counterparts. In females,  and  μg·kg-1 daily doses of CBDA-ME were also evaluated. Behavioural tests were performed for hind paw mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds once a week for  weeks. At endpoint, in vivo electrophysiological recordings were obtained to characterize soma threshold changes in primary sensory neurons. Key results In males, CBDA-ME elicited a significant concentration-dependent chronic anti-hyperalgesic effect, also influencing both nociceptive and non-nociceptive mechanoreceptors, which were not observed in females at any of the concentrations tested.

Strategies have been developed to identify children suspected of having been exposed to maltreatment with the aim of reducing further maltreatment and impairment. This systematic review evaluates the accuracy of strategies for identifying children exposed to maltreatment. Methods We conducted a systematic search of seven databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Libraries, Sociological Abstracts and the Education Resources Information Center. We included studies published from 196 to July 2, 201 estimating the accuracy of instruments for identifying potential maltreatment of children, including neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse. We extracted data about accuracy and narratively synthesised the evidence. For five studies—where the population and setting matched known prevalence estimates in an emergency department setting—we calculated false positives and negatives. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2. Results We included 3 articles (representing 3 studies) that evaluated various identification strategies, including three screening tools (SPUTOVAMO checklist, Escape instrument, and a 6-item screening questionnaire for child sex trafficking). No studies evaluated the effects of identification strategies on important outcomes for children. All studies were rated as having serious risk of bias (often because of verification bias). The findings suggest that use of the SPUTOVAMO and Escape screening tools at the population level (per 100,000) would result in hundreds of children being missed and thousands of children being over identified. Conclusions There is low to very low certainty evidence that the use of screening tools may result in high numbers of children being falsely suspected or missed.

METHOD Twenty-two caregivers of children aged  to 5 years receiving rehabilitation services, who reported dissatisfaction with their child's participation, had internet access, and could read and write English, were recruited for this 2-week, single-arm pilot trial. Feasibility was assessed through retention rates, completion time, percentage of care plans developed relative to caregiver reported need, and independent completion of PEM+ 2.0. Acceptability was assessed by the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use Questionnaire. Preliminary effects were assessed by two items on caregiver reported impact of PEM+ 2.0 on confidence for addressing their child's participation. RESULTS Eighteen caregivers completed at least one iteration of PEM+ 2.0; of those, 17 were female and 1 were 3 to 39 years old.

Despite reported gaps in MCC quality, there have been few efforts to improve its functioning. The purpose of this study was to use theoretically-rooted knowledge translation (KT) theories and frameworks to inform the development of a strategy to improve MCC decision-making quality. Methods A multi-phased approach was used to design an intervention titled the KT-MCC Strategy. First, key informant interviews framed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) were conducted with MCC participants to identify barriers and facilitators to optimal MCC decision-making. Second, identified TDF domains were mapped to corresponding strategies using the COM-B Behavior Change Wheel to develop the KT-MCC Strategy. Finally, focus groups with MCC participants were held to confirm acceptability of the proposed KT-MCC Strategy. Results Data saturation was reached at n = 2 interviews. Twenty-seven barrier themes and 1 facilitator themes were ascribed to 1 and 1 TDF domains, respectively. Differences in reported barriers by physician specialty were observed. The resulting KT-MCC Strategy included workshops, chair training, team training, standardized intake forms and a synoptic discussion checklist, and, audit and feedback. Focus groups ( n = 3, participants 18) confirmed the acceptability of the identified interventions. Conclusion Myriad factors were found to influence MCC decision making. We present a novel application of the TDF and COM-B to the context of MCCs.

Current test methods for quantifying diffusivity of chlorides in concrete are time consuming and demanding. A comprehensive electrical resistivity model has been developed to quantify the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete. The model employs the modified Nernst-Einstein equation along with an ionic concentration sub-model, a pore solution conductivity sub-model, and a binder hydration sub-model. The sub-models, which account for the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and OH− ions in the pore solution derived from the binder degree of hydration, binder chemical composition, and alkalis binding to the cement hydration products, are included to accurately quantify the conductivity of the pore solution. Moreover, an experimental program was developed to verify and validate the accuracy and completeness of the electrical resistivity model. The experimental variables are volume fraction of coarse aggregate, water to binder ratio, total binder content, and silica fume (SF) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as supplementary cementing materials (SCMs). The model results are found statistically equal to experimentally quantified chloride diffusion coefficient values and possess high accuracy and precision for a wide range of concrete mixture, binder composition and age.",2020-06-24,Cement & Concrete Composites,https://openalex.org/V123887920,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103707,103707,103707,113,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3038054276,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103707,journal-article,3038054276

However, efficient algorithms for solving IQP problems in water quality management (WQM) have not been well studied. In this study, an IQP model is developed for WQM under uncertainty. Three solution algorithms, including a piecewise linear approximation (PLA) method, a derivative algorithm (DEA) and a duality-based algorithm (DUA) are proposed for solving the IQP-WQM problem. The developed model and the corresponding solution algorithms are applied to a hypothetic WQM problem to demonstrate their applicability. The results show the lower bounds of the total cost obtained by three algorithms have a relationship of f D U A − = f D E A − ≤ f P L A − , while that of the upper bounds is f D E A + ≤ f P L A + ≤ f D U A + . Moreover, the sensitivity analysis shows that no matter how the IQP-WQM model is solved, the model response from the three solution algorithms is consistent. The results indicate that all of the three algorithms can efficiently deal with quadratic programming problems under uncertainties in the format of intervals. Comparison among the three algorithms shows that DUA provides interval solutions with wider ranges than the other two methods, and it requires less computational efforts than DEA. It is also found that PLA is more flexible and might require lower computational efforts for large scale problems.

Design Secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal study, the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly. Setting Primary care. Participants Adults 6 years and older at risk for disability who completed ≥1 follow-up call (N=391). Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures We computed separate logistic regression models using the SPPB, LLFDI-function, and frailty phenotype as independent variables and falls, hospitalizations, ED visits, and SRH over 1 and 2 years as dependent variables. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and the areas under the curves calculated. Results Participants had a mean age of 76.5±7.1 years. The SPPB, LLFDI-function, and frailty phenotype all predicted hospitalizations and low SRH over a 1- and 2-year timeframe (odds ratio [OR] min-max, 1.35-1.51 and 1.67-3.07, respectively). Over 2 years, the SPPB predicted ED visits (OR, 1.28), and the LLFDI-function predicted falls (OR, 1.31). The LLFDI-function predicted low SRH better than the frailty phenotype over 1 year. There were no differences between the measures for any of the other outcomes. Conclusions The SPPB, LLFDI-function, and frailty phenotype had similar accuracy for predicting falls, hospitalizations, ED visits, and low SRH over 1 and 2 years among older primary care patients at risk for disability.

Live attenuated measles vaccine strains have been used successfully for immunization for decades and are currently investigated in trials of oncolytic virotherapy. The available reverse genetics systems allow for insertion of additional genes, including heterologous antigens. Here, we designed recombinant measles vaccine vectors for priming and activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. For proof-of-concept, we used cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines specific for the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2), or the model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), respectively. We generated recombinant measles vaccine vectors with TRP-2 and OVA epitope cassette variants for expression of the full-length antigen or the respective immunodominant CD8+ epitope, with additional variants mediating secretion or proteasomal degradation of the epitope. We show that these recombinant measles virus vectors mediate varying levels of MHC class I (MHC-I)-restricted epitope presentation, leading to activation of cognate CTLs, as indicated by secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) in vitro. Importantly, the recombinant OVA vaccines also mediate priming of naïve OT-I CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells. While all vaccine variants can prime and activate cognate T cells, IFNγ release was enhanced using a secreted epitope variant and a variant with epitope strings targeted to the proteasome.

The postoperative period includes numerous interventions, including fluid administration and transfusion of blood products, medication use (including heparin), and increased risk of organ dysfunction and infection. Understanding normal thrombopoietin physiology and the associated expected postoperative platelet count changes is the crucial first step in evaluation. Timing of thrombocytopenia is the most important feature when differentiating causes of postoperative thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia within  days of surgery is commonly caused by hemodilution and increased perioperative platelet consumption prior to thrombopoietin-induced platelet count recovery and transient platelet count overshoot. A much broader list of possible conditions that can cause late-onset thrombocytopenia (postoperative day  [POD5] or later) is generally divided into consumptive and destructive causes. The former includes common (eg, infection-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation) and rare (eg, postoperative thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) conditions, whereas the latter includes such entities as drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia or posttransfusion purpura. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a unique entity associated with thrombosis that is typically related to intraoperative/perioperative heparin exposure, although it can develop following knee replacement surgery even in the absence of heparin exposure. Very late onset (POD10 or later) of thrombocytopenia can indicate bacterial or fungal infection. Lastly, thrombocytopenia after mechanical device implantation requires unique considerations.

This phenomenon occurs more apparently in acoustic sensor surveillance system and complicates angle-only target tracking problems. As a result, the current state of the target kinematic information is difficult to estimate. For the double observer systems, even if they are synchronized, there is a time-offset between the observers due to signal propagation delay. So each observer receives signals from the same target at different emission times. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to deal with this time-offset by building a set of constraints for a centralized double observer system in a three-dimensional environment, and using the Gauss-Helmert model for the state transition of two adjacent consecutive states. Furthermore, we consider the varying underwater sound speed and apply a sound speed profile model. Also, a novel algorithm is developed for the underwater environment, and its convergence condition is mathematically derived.

Survival through this period can be particularly challenging when it coincides with harsh environmental conditions such as a winter climate or food scarcity, leading to highly variable cohort survival. However, the small size and dispersive nature of juveniles generally make studying their survival more difficult. In territorial species, a key life-history event is the acquisition of a territory. A territory is expected to enhance survival, but how it does so is not often identified. We tested how the timing of territory acquisition influenced the winter survival of juvenile North American red squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, hereafter red squirrels, and how the timing of this event mediated the sources of mortality. We hypothesized that securing a territory prior to when food resources become available would reduce juvenile susceptibility to predation and climatic factors overwinter. Using 27 years of data on the survival of individually marked juvenile red squirrels, we tested how the timing of territory acquisition influenced survival, whether the population density of red squirrel predators and mean temperature overwinter were related to individual survival probability, and if territory ownership mediated these effects. Juvenile red squirrel survival was lower in the years of high predator abundance and in colder winters. Autumn territory owners were less susceptible to lynx Lynx canadensis and possibly mustelid Mustela and Martes spp., predation. Autumn territory owners had lower survival in colder winters, but surprisingly non-owners had higher survival in cold winters. Our results show how the timing of a life-history event like territory acquisition can directly affect survival and also mediate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors later in life.

This research seeks to quantify the impacts of driving status on out-of-home and social activity engagement among non-working older (≥ 65 years) Canadians, and the distribution of these impacts across socio-demographic and self-reported health domains. Nationally representative cross-sectional time diary data were used to measure the participation rates and daily durations of out-of-home and social activity engagement among non-working older Canadians who have a driver's license (i.e., drivers) and those who did not (i.e., non-drivers). Results indicate drivers were, on average, more than twice as likely to participate in out-of-home and social activities compared to non-drivers. However, the mean durations of activity engagement, among the participant sub-sample, appear largely invariant to driving status. Among the socio-demographic and self-reported health factors affecting out-of-home and social activity engagement, geography appears the most influential for participation rates and durations, particularly for non-drivers who live in small towns and rural areas.

In particular, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and their combination are being considered as therapeutic alternatives for treatment of NP. This study aimed to examine whether sex affects long-term outcomes on persistent mechanical hypersensitivity  weeks after ceasing cannabinoid administration. Clinically relevant low doses of THC, CBD, and a 1:1 combination of THC:CBD extracts, in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, were orally gavaged for 1 consecutive days to age-matched groups of male and female sexually mature Sprague Dawley rats. Treatments commenced one day after surgically inducing a pro-nociceptive state using a peripheral sciatic nerve cuff. The analgesic efficacy of each phytocannabinoid was assessed relative to MCT oil using hind paw mechanical behavioural testing once a week for  weeks. In vivo intracellular electrophysiology was recorded at endpoint to characterize soma threshold changes in primary afferent sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervated by the affected sciatic nerve. The thymus, spleen, and DRG were collected post-sacrifice and analyzed for long-term effects on markers associated with T lymphocytes at the RNA level using qPCR. Administration of cannabinoids, particularly the 1:1 combination of THC, elicited a sustained mechanical anti-hypersensitive effect in males with persistent peripheral NP, which corresponded to beneficial changes in myelinated Aβ mechanoreceptive fibers. Specific immune cell markers associated with T cell differentiation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, previously implicated in repair processes, were differentially up-regulated by cannabinoids in males treated with cannabinoids, but not in females, warranting further investigation into sexual dimorphisms that may underlie treatment outcomes.",2020-06-04,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234176,e0234176,e0234176,15,6,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034126401,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234176,journal-article,3034126401

However, it is noteworthy that the catalyst performance of SCR device would degrade over the service time gradually. If the performance degrading is not well-compensated, the NO $_{x}$ conversion efficiency would reduce significantly. Different from detecting the aging issue in the laboratory, a practical method is to design an observer to estimate the aging factor online such that the urea injection can be modified accordingly. In this paper, we aim to construct an aging-factor observer for two-cell SCR systems. In order to reduce the algorithm computational load and guarantee the implementation performance, we propose a dual time-scale algorithm based on two-cell SCR model and unscented Kalman filter. There is a fast time scale and a slow time scale in the algorithm. Two simulation studies of constant aging factor and time-varying aging factor are investigated in the simulation environment of MATLAB/SIMULINK.

Predictive models with satisfactory accuracy for estimating mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) exist; physicians, however, seldom use these models. We evaluated the relative accuracy of physician vs model prediction to estimate 1-year survival in ambulatory patients with HF.We conducted a single-centre cross-sectional study involving 15 consecutive ambulatory patients with HF >1 years of age with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%. Each patient's cardiologist and family doctor provided their predicted 1-year survival, and predicted survival scores were calculated using 3 models: HF Meta-Score, Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), and Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic HF (MAGGIC) score. We compared accuracy between physician and model predictions using intraclass correlation (ICC).Median predicted survival by HF cardiologists was lower (median 80%, interquartile range [IQR]: 61%-90%) than that predicted by family physicians (median 90%, IQR 70%-99%, P = 0.08). One-year median survival calculated by the HF Meta-Score (94.6%), SHFM (95.4%), and MAGGIC (88.9%,) proved as high or higher than physician estimates. Agreement among HF cardiologists (ICC 0.28-0.41) and family physicians (ICC 0.43-0.47) when compared with 1-year model-predicted survival scores proved limited, whereas the 3 models agreed well (ICC  0.65).HF cardiologists underestimated survival in comparison with family physicians, whereas both physician estimates were lower than calculated model estimates.

However, the metastable nature of TMNs often results in the inevitable formation of metallic, oxidized and hydroxide impurities during fabrication. The effects of the inevitable impurities over TMNs in hydrogen evolution reaction are still unclear. Herein, choosing Ni3N as a typical example, the effect of oxidized impurity in transition metal nitride for hydrogen evolution has been systematically investigated. The metal oxdie-metal nitride heterojunction which has been in-situ created by calcinations process exhibits obviously improved performance in boosting hydrogen evolution efficiency of semiconductors as compared to metal nitride by forming Z-scheme pathway. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements demonstrate the formation of reductive defects on the surface of semiconductors created by ammonia treatment which also boost the hydrogen evolution efficiency. Therefore, the optimal ternary sample exhibits the highest hydrogen evolution rate (151.5 μmol g−1 h−1) under solar light irradiation, which is about 54 times higher than that of pure sample.",2020-03-01,Applied Materials Today,https://openalex.org/V2764609219,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2019.100476,,,,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981045599,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2019.100476,journal-article,2981045599

We investigate the relationship between cultural continuity and self-rated health looking specifically at Inuit living in the Canadian Arctic. Methods The Arctic Supplements of the Aboriginal Peoples Survey from years 200 and 200 were appended to explore the relationship between various measures of cultural continuity and self-rated health. These measures include access to government services in an Aboriginal language, Inuit cultural variables, community involvement and governance. Literature related to Inuit social determinants of health and health-related behaviours were used to build the models. Results All measures of cultural continuity were shown to have a positive association with self-rated health for Inuit participants. Background and other control variables influenced the strength of the association but not the direction of the association. Access to services in an Aboriginal language, harvesting activities and government satisfaction were all significantly related to the odds of better health outcomes. Finally, the study contributes a baseline from a known data horizon against which future studies can assess changes and understand future impacts of changes. Conclusion The Canadian government and other agencies should address health inequalities between Inuit and non-Inuit people through programmes designed to foster cultural continuity at a community level. Providing access to services in an Aboriginal language is a superficial way of promoting cultural alignment of these services; however, more inclusion of Inuit traditional knowledge is needed to have a positive influence on health.",2020-01-01,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,https://openalex.org/V156988948,BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2018-211856,64,70,74,1,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982653565,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2018-211856,journal-article,2982653565

However, in Canada, patients awaiting bariatric surgery can be subjected to prolonged wait times, thereby subjecting them to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as decreased psychosocial well-being.ObjectiveTo assess the factors associated with prolonged wait times for bariatric surgery within a publicly funded, provincial bariatric network.MethodsThis was a retrospective population-based study of all patients aged > 18 years who were referred for bariatric surgery from April 2009 to May 201 using linked administrative databases to capture patient demographic data, socioeconomic variables, healthcare utilization, and institutional factors. The main outcome of interest was a wait time greater than 18 months. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsA total of 18,854 patients underwent bariatric surgery from April 2009 to December 2016, of which 240 patients experienced wait times of > 18 months. On average, yearly wait times have increased for patients receiving surgery with wait times of 10.98 months (SD 5.48) in 201 and 13.09 (SD 6.69) in 201 (p < 0.001). Increasing age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05–1.19, p = 0.0004), BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.11, p < 0.001), and male gender (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28–1.70, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased bariatric surgery wait times. Additionally, smoking status (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09–1.97, p = 0.0118) and obesity-related comorbidities particularly diabetes (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14–1.44, p < 0.001) and heart failure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.43–2.07, p < 0.001) were correlated with prolonged wait times for surgery. Socioeconomic variables including disability (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.38–1.92, p < 0.001) and immigration status (OR 1.35, 95% 1.11–1.64, p = 0.003) were correlated with increased odds of longer wait times, as were regions with regionalized assessment and treatment centres (RATC) when referenced against centers of excellence (COEs) in number of days added with 20.45 (95% CI 13.20–27.70, p < 0.001).ConclusionWait times for bariatric surgery in a publicly funded, regionalized bariatric program are influenced by certain patient characteristics, socioeconomic variables, and institutional factors.

The amphiphilic DChNa structure is beneficial for adsorption of this molecule on chemically inert hydrophobic surfaces and particle dispersion. The electrochemical film formation mechanism is based on the electrogenerated acid formation, protonation and charge neutralization of anionic DCh− species. SEM and FTIR are used for the analysis of film morphology and composition. Potentiodynamic and impedance spectroscopy studies show that PTFE films deposited by EPD provide protection of steel from corrosion. The use of DChNa allows the fabrication of composites by combined electrochemical strategies. Diamond-polypyrrole (PPy) films are prepared by an EPD-electropolymerization method.

This approach measures changes in the impulse response between sources and receivers and estimates a location based on optical channel sounding data. An exponential integrating-sphere model is used to represent object impulse response (OIR) from each luminaire source-receiver pair, which is obtained by subtracting impulse response (IR) of the room background (i.e., without an object) from IR when the object is present inside the room. This model is represented as a function of 3D position of the object and depends on both source and receiver parameters and the physical geometry of the room. An analytical expression of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the proposed passive indoor localization method is derived. The position is also estimated by using a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator which gives the position estimate by maximizing the log-likelihood function of the received noisy OIR waveforms. The results show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of source-receiver pairs used in the estimation, play a crucial role in performance.

The performance of a heat recovery system, suitable for low temperature commercial applications ~300 °C, is investigated for a range of heat exchanger sizes of  to  TEG rows and exhaust gas mass flow rates of 0.02 to 0.08 kg/s. The adverse effect of the heat conducted axially, along the flow direction, on the total power output of the TEGs is quantified. The number of rows reaches an optimum value for a given gas flow rate beyond which a significant drop in the hot-side temperature of the upstream TEG rows occurs due to the increase of the axial conduction between successive rows. The term “Power Gain” is introduced in this study as the ratio between the power output from a system without axial conduction to that with axial conduction. Power Gain shows the potential benefits of limiting the axial conduction through the heat exchanger and values up to 1.2 times (20% increase in power) can be obtained for relatively low exhaust gas flow rates (~0.02 kg/s). Novel performance maps are developed to correlate the power output with the heat exchanger design, exhaust gas flow rate and number of TEGs. Such maps can be used to guide the optimization of the design of TEG-integrated waste heat recovery systems.",2020-03-01,Applied Energy,https://openalex.org/V109565702,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114434,114434,114434,261,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000063884,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114434,journal-article,3000063884

To begin, to characterize genomic signatures associated with the evolution of social life in spiders, we performed one of the first spider comparative genomics studies including five solitary species and two social species, representing two independent origins of sociality in the genus Stegodyphus. We found that the two social spider species had a large expansion of gene families associated with transport and metabolic processes and an elevated genome-wide rate of molecular evolution compared with the five solitary spider species. Genes that were rapidly evolving in the two social species relative to the five solitary species were enriched for transport, behavior, and immune functions, whereas genes that were rapidly evolving in the solitary species were enriched for energy metabolism processes. Most rapidly evolving genes in the social species Stegodyphus dumicola were broadly expressed across four tissues and enriched for transport functions, but 12 rapidly evolving genes showed brain-specific expression and were enriched for social behavioral processes. Altogether, our study identifies putative genomic signatures and potential candidate genes associated with spider sociality. These results indicate that future spider comparative genomic studies, including broader sampling and additional independent origins of sociality, can further clarify the genomic causes and consequences of social life.",2020-03-01,Genome Biology and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V10195028,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa007,122,133,12,3,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001726937,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa007,journal-article,3001726937

However, given the varied operational features in any transit network, the perceived service quality is expected to vary between different types of operation. Recently, there has been an emphasis on addressing this issue and quantifying the variation in the perceived service quality at route level. In this respect, this study quantifies the perceived quality of bus services across different route types and user groups. A two-step cluster analysis is developed to classify bus routes based on their operational features, which is followed by a series of importance-performance analysis (IPA) models corresponding to each route type. The study is supported by a primary dataset collected from 1,883 users through an online survey in Hamilton, Canada. The emerging results indicate four predominant route types: core, standard, express, and local routes, each exhibiting a unique set of characteristics. The IPA models show an apparent variation in the perceived service quality from each route-type. In addition, there are clear indications of differential perception between passengers who use the service very frequently and other less frequent users.

The BTE approach relies on interatomic force constants derived from atomic force calculations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a reliable approach to compute interatomic forces. However, the calculation of interatomic forces using DFT is computationally demanding, and thus significantly limiting its applications. In such cases, empirical potential (EP) calculations are an efficient alternative. However, EPs are not usually constructed to correctly describe lattice vibration properties. In this work, we perform a comparison of lattice vibrations and thermal properties of UO2 solving the BTE using DFT + U and EP computed forces. The experimental lattice thermal conductivity of UO2 is found to be correctly described by DFT + U, while it is only approximated by the Cooper and Potashnikov potentials. However, the heat capacity is only closely reproduced by DFT + U and the Potashnikov potential. In contrast, significant errors were obtained with the Arima and Yamada potentials in all the computed results. The discrepancies in the predicted thermal properties by interatomic potentials were determined to be related to inaccuracies in the description of phonon properties.",2020-05-01,Computational Materials Science,https://openalex.org/V26018076,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109594,,,,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007588882,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109594,journal-article,3007588882

This mode of operation, known as intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), is simple to implement in practice. However, computing the channel capacity of the underlying channel is not straightforward because of the amplitude constraints that arise due to IM/DD operation. In particular, the transmit signal must be non-negative, while the peak and average amplitudes are constrained due to practical and safety considerations. Though a closed form for the capacity of IM/DD channels is not known, much work has been done to find capacity bounds and asymptotic capacity expressions. In this paper, a description of the IM/DD channel and its physical constraints is presented, followed by a review of recent progress pertaining to the capacity of IM/DD channels. Additionally, capacity-achieving distributions are discussed along with simple constructions that approach capacity.

In variable habitats, however, a single pattern cannot match all available sites all of the time, and efficacy may therefore be reduced. Active color change provides an alternative where coloration can be altered to match local conditions, but again efficacy may be limited by the speed of change and range of patterns available. Transparency, on the other hand, creates high-fidelity camouflage that changes instantaneously to match any substrate but is potentially compromised in terrestrial environments where image distortion may be more obvious than in water. Glass frogs are one example of terrestrial transparency and are well known for their transparent ventral skin through which their bones, intestines, and beating hearts can be seen. However, sparse dorsal pigmentation means that these frogs are better described as translucent. To investigate whether this imperfect transparency acts as camouflage, we used in situ behavioral trials, visual modeling, and laboratory psychophysics. We found that the perceived luminance of the frogs changed depending on the immediate background, lowering detectability and increasing survival when compared to opaque frogs. Moreover, this change was greatest for the legs, which surround the body at rest and create a diffuse transition from background to frog luminance rather than a sharp, highly salient edge. This passive change in luminance, without significant modification of hue, suggests a camouflage strategy, “edge diffusion,” distinct from both transparency and active color change.",2020-06-09,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919417117,12885,12890,117,23,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3029286719,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919417117,journal-article,3029286719

Correlated growth modeling revealed that disorganized, relative to organized, dyads had significant magnitude of change over time, such that, among disorganized dyads, as mothers had greater declines in cortisol, infants had greater increases. The difference score analysis revealed that disorganized, relative to organized, dyads had a greater divergence between maternal and infant cortisol values, such that maternal values were lower than infant values.

A number of different socioeconomic indices have been developed to determine which neighbourhood-level indicators are most strongly associated with early child development outcomes in Canada. While these indices attempt to account for variability in outcomes across neighbourhoods, they have some important limitations: they either do not use indicators meaningful for families with young children or they are based on a large number of indicators. Here we describe how we developed a new index, the Canadian Neighbourhoods Early Child Development (CanNECD) SES Index, which addresses these limitations. Socioeconomic and demographic variables for custom-defined neighbourhoods were obtained from Canada Census and income tax data. Measures of developmental health came from the Early Development Instrument, a teacher-completed questionnaire measuring vulnerability across five developmental domains in kindergarten. We selected variables for the index based on empirical relationships to health and/or social determinants of health, then used exploratory factor analyses and linear regressions to choose ten variables that maximized explanatory power and interpretability for developmental health. The CanNECD SES Index accounts for 32% of the variance in neighbourhood-level overall vulnerability across developmental domains, whereas existing indices account for 17% or less. Analyses within individual Canadian provinces indicate that the explanatory power of our index ranges from 13 to 42%.

Lagrange's principle is employed to develop an equivalent mechanical model for the system. The sloshing liquid provides additional gravitational restoring force to the pendulum TMD but does not provide a corresponding increase to its inertia. As a result, the natural frequency of the pendulum TMD is increased due to the TSD degree-of-freedom. Shake table testing is conducted on several pendulum TMD-TSD systems that are subjected to harmonic base excitation at discrete frequencies near the natural frequency of the pendulum TMD. The modeled and experimental results are in reasonable agreement when the liquid is not shallow or the response amplitude is not large.

We sought to determine if simple cardiac risk scores are associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease including carotid wall volume (CWV), carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), and silent brain infarction (SBI). Methods and results A total of 759 adults with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) underwent risk factor assessment and a non-contrast enhanced MRI of the carotid arteries and brain using a standardized protocol in a population-based cohort recruited between 201 and 2018. The non-lab-based INTERHEART risk score (IHRS) was calculated in all participants; the Framingham Risk Score was calculated in a subset who provided blood samples (n = 3889). The association between these risk scores and MRI measures of CWV, carotid IPH, and SBI was determined. The mean age of the cohort was 5 (8.9) years, 55% were women. Each 5-point increase (∼1 SD) in the IHRS was associated with a  mm3 increase in CWV, adjusted for sex (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), a 23% increase in IPH [95% confidence interval (CI) 9–38%], and a 32% (95% CI 20–45%) increase in SBI. These associations were consistent for lacunar and non-lacunar brain infarction. The Framingham Risk Score was also significantly associated with CWV, IPH, and SBI. CWV was additive and independent to the risk scores in its association with IPH and SBI. Conclusion Simple cardiovascular risk scores are significantly associated with the presence of MRI-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease, including CWV, IPH, and SBI in an adult population without known clinical CVD.",2020-06-01,European Journal of Echocardiography,https://openalex.org/V64942916,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez226,692,700,21,6,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977423392,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez226,journal-article,2977423392

Indeed, the term severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) has been coined. We aimed to ascertain whether the presence of fungi, in particular Aspergillus fumigatus, in the airway correlated with asthma severity and control. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether traditional markers of Aspergillus sensitization related to the presence of Aspergillus within the airway. Methods Sixty-nine patients characterized by asthma severity (GINA) and level of control (ACQ-7) underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Serum was assessed for A fumigatus-specific IgE and total IgE. Galactomannan and relevant cytokine levels were assessed in serum, plasma and BAL. BAL was analyzed for the presence of A fumigatus. Results In BAL, fungi were visible by microscopy in 70% and present by qPCR in 86% of patients, while A fumigatus was detectable by qPCR in 46%. Plasma and BAL IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 and TNF-α correlated with BAL fungal presence, while plasma IL-1 correlated with BAL fungal presence. Aspergillus positive BAL correlated with increased plasma and BAL IL- and BAL IL-13. There was no relationship between fungal airway presence and steroid dose, asthma severity or control. The presence of Aspergillus within the airway did not relate to serum IgE positivity for Aspergillus.

Partnering for Change has been successful in facilitating equitable access to services and eliminating wait lists; however, it could have a more significant impact through improved capacity-building with families. The purpose of this study is to describe the factors that therapists view as influencing the development of family–therapist relationships in Partnering for Change, and to explore their ideas to improve relationship-building. Methods Focus groups were completed with 15 occupational therapists who provided Partnering for Change school-based services. Qualitative description methodology and directed content analysis were utilized. Results Several factors were identified that influenced the development of family–therapist relationships including competing demands; consistency and availability; awareness, readiness and commitment; relationships with schools and educators; and sociodemographic characteristics. Increasing in-person interactions and awareness of occupational therapy services were suggested to improve relationship-building.

However, depending on the edge preparation method, the edge properties are also altered. Most of the reported work is limited to the effect of edge micro-geometry. In this paper, cutting edges prepared by pressurized air wet abrasive jet machining (PAWAJM) were evaluated from several aspects including tool edge geometries, tool surface quality and topographies, edge hardness (H) and residual stresses. Furthermore, the influence of the prepared edge on the tool performance of uncoated tungsten carbide cutting inserts with different average cutting edge rounding ( S ¯ ) as well as different form factor (K) were experimentally investigated through the orthogonal turning of AISI 4140 alloy steel. Results show that the performance of the prepared cutting edge depends on the combined effect of the initial state of edge geometry and edge properties For symmetric edges (form factor K = 1), the optimum range for average cutting edge rounding ( S ¯ ) was found to be 20 μm to 30 μm when using cemented carbide tools for dry machining AISI 4140 steel at a feed rate (f) =0.1 mm/rev, width of cut = 3 mm, and cutting speed (vc) = 300 m/min.",2020-03-01,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,https://openalex.org/V127530304,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2019.116456,116456,116456,277,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980783302,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2019.116456,journal-article,2980783302

In this study, a cradle to grave attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to produce drop-in renewable diesel from biogas (via solid-state anaerobic digestion) derived from energy crop, i.e. miscanthus cultivated in strip-mined lands. The analysis included miscanthus cultivation, harvesting, and transportation to the biorefinery, conversion of the biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and combustion of the drop-in renewable diesel for a passenger vehicle. Results showed that the miscanthus derived drop-in renewable diesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 73% when compared with that of the conventional fossil-derived diesel. Similarly, the proposed design consumes 4.91 MJ/GGE of fossil fuel compared to the conventional diesel with fossil fuel depletion of 18.98 MJ/GGE. Although the respiratory effects, smog formation, acidification, and eutrophication potentials of the miscanthus to drop-in renewable diesel process are relatively higher than the conventional process, the proposed technology still represents a sustainable liquid fuels pathway that is less dependent on fossil fuel, can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help attain the renewable transportation fuels standard.",2020-03-10,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119358,119358,119358,249,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989917558,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119358,journal-article,2989917558

It is unclear whether adding vasopressin or vasopressin analogues to catecholamine therapy is beneficial in the management of patients with distributive shock. The purpose of this guideline was to develop an evidence-based recommendation regarding the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors in the management of adults with distributive shock. We summarized the evidence informing this recommendation by updating a recently published meta-analysis. Then, a multidisciplinary panel from the Canadian Critical Care Society developed the recommendation using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The updated systematic review identified 25 randomized controlled trials including a total of 3,737 patients with distributive shock. Compared with catecholamine therapy alone, the addition of vasopressin or its analogues was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 0.99; low certainty), reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.88; high certainty), and increased risk of digital ischemia (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.25; moderate certainty).

One of the possible ways to prevent these fractures is through early identification of people at greatest risk so that preventive measures can be properly implemented. Many numerical techniques that are designed to predict the femur fracture risk are validated through performing quasi-static (QS) mechanical tests on isolated cadaveric femurs, whereas the real hip fracture is a result of an impact (IM) incident. The goal of this study was to compare the fracture limits of the proximal femur under IM and QS conditions in the simulation of a sideways fall to identify any possible relationship between them. Eight pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric femurs were divided into two groups of QS and IM (left and right randomized). All femurs were scanned with a Hologic DXA scanner and then cut and potted in a cylindrical tube. To measure the stiffness in two conditions of the single-leg stance (SLS) and sideways fall (SWF), non-destructive tests at a QS displacement rate were performed on the two groups. For the destructive tests, the QS group was tested in SWF configuration with the rate of 0.017 mm/s using a material testing machine, and the IM group was tested in the same configuration inside a pneumatic IM device with the projectile target displacement rate of 3 m/s. One of the IM specimens was excluded due to multiple strikes. The result of this study showed that there were no significant differences in the SLS and SWF stiffnesses between the two groups (P = 0.15 and P = 0.64, respectively). The destructive test results indicated that there was a significant difference in the fracture loads of the two groups (P  Using the relationship developed herein, results from another study were extrapolated with errors of less than 12%, showing that meaningful predictions for the impact scenario can be made based on the quasi-static tests. The result of this study suggests that there is a potential to replace IM tests with QS displacement rate tests, and this will provide important information that can be used for future studies evaluating clinical factors related to fracture risk.",2020-03-01,Journal of The Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials,https://openalex.org/V100249163,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103593,103593,103593,103,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995478109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103593,journal-article,2995478109

Over the past decade, newer microfluidic designs have been developed to overcome some of the limitations of the hollow fiber technology such as the lack of the ability to provide biomimetic flow paths to reduce shear stress and hence potentially initiation of the blood coagulation cascade as well as the difficulty to reduce the distance between fibers to decrease the resistance to diffusion of gases on the blood compartment while achieving higher efficiency of gas exchange. Nevertheless, the microfluidic designs that have been reported in the literature only provide gas exchange interfaces on one or two sides of their rectangular cross-section blood perfusion channels, thereby limiting gas exchange efficiency. Here, we report on a new design where closed gas chambers are placed adjacent to the blood perfusion channels so that the gas exchange into the blood can occur on all four sides. We demonstrate that such a design will increase the gas exchange surface area without affecting the channel's geometry or its flow characteristics. The gas exchange performance of the new design is enhanced up to 223% Compared with its equivalent double-sided gas exchange design. These new designs are expected, in the future, to help microfluidic oxygenators combine the best characteristics of both the microfluidic and hollow fiber designs to achieve superior performance.",2020-02-15,Journal of Membrane Science,https://openalex.org/V119469986,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117741,117741,117741,596,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995723838,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117741,journal-article,2995723838

This study examined the potential mediating role of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in the association between parent psychopathology and child mental disorder. Data come from 10 children diagnosed with a mental disorder [major depression (6 %), generalized anxiety (5 %), attention-deficit hyperactivity (3 %), oppositional defiant (3 %)] and their parents. Parent psychopathology was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Child mental disorder was measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and hair samples were assayed using high-sensitivity ELISA for cortisol extraction. Sex-specific path models were specified to estimate mediating effects (αβ). Children were, on average, 14.4 (SD 2.3) years of age and 7 % were girls. Adjusting for child age, parent sex, and family income, HCC mediated the association between symptoms of parent psychopathology and major depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity in all children (αβ ranging -0.0 to 0.19; 38-46 % effect mediated). Mediating effects for generalized anxiety and opposition defiant were evident for boys only (αβ ranging -0.2 to 0.14; 31-38 % effect mediated). Evidence suggests HCC partially mediates the association between parent psychopathology and child mental disorder, and for generalized anxiety and oppositional defiant, this effect is specific to boys.

Of those treated for a first episode of schizophrenia, three out of four can expect to achieve remission. The question of how long antipsychotic medication should be continued has been a topic of heated debate in the field. Longitudinal studies of individuals diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis have reported that as many as 30% may be able to come off of medications without relapsing while treatment discontinuation studies have found that very few patients remain in remission off of medication. This paper reviews the literature on relapse rates following a first episode of schizophrenia and identifies factors that contribute to the discrepancies in the rates reported. These factors include sampling considerations, the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses, the duration of follow-up, the rate of medication discontinuation and the criteria used to define illness recurrence. We propose that individuals for whom the diagnosis of their first psychotic episode is determined with ongoing follow-up to be due to schizophrenia are at extremely high risk of relapse and should be advised to continue antipsychotic medication for the long-term. Those whose first episode of psychosis is determined to be due to other causes are also at high risk of illness recurrence off medications.

Convenience and purposive sampling techniques were employed. A grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. Codes, categories and themes were generated using NVIVO software. Results Providers reported that they offered gestational weight gain counselling to all patients early in pregnancy. Counselling topics included gestational weight gain targets, nutrition &amp; exercise, gestational diabetes prevention, while dispelling misconceptions about gestational weight gain. Most do not routinely address the adverse outcomes linked to gestational weight gain, or daily caloric intake goals for pregnancy. The health care providers all faced similar barriers to counselling including patient attitudes, social and cultural issues, and accessibility of resources. Patient enthusiasm and access to a dietician motivated health care providers to provide more in-depth gestational weight gain counselling. Conclusion Reported gestational weight gain counselling practices were similar between midwives, obstetricians and family physicians. Antenatal knowledge translation tools for patients and health care providers are needed, and would seem to be suitable for use across all three types of health care provider specialties.",2020-02-12,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,https://openalex.org/V123732490,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-2791-8,,,20,1,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012894966,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-2791-8,journal-article,3012894966

The objective of this study was to develop a population-based case-finding strategy to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed airflow obstruction (asthma or COPD) amongst adults with respiratory symptoms in Canada. Methods Adults without a previous history of asthma, COPD or lung disease were recruited using random digit-dialling and asked if they had symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum or wheeze within the past  months. Those who answered affirmatively completed the Asthma Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), COPD-Diagnostic Questionnaire (COPD-DQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Those with an ASQ score of ≥ or a COPD-DQ score of ≥2 underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry to diagnose asthma or COPD. Results 1 11 individuals were contacted at home and assessed for study eligibility. Of the 126 eligible individuals, 91 (72%) enrolled and underwent spirometry. Ultimately, 18 subjects (20% of those enrolled) had obstructive lung disease (73 asthma and 11 COPD). Individuals found to have undiagnosed asthma or COPD had more severe respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life compared with those without airflow obstruction. The ASQ, COPD-DQ, and CAT had ROC areas for predicting undiagnosed asthma or COPD of 0.49, 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. Four descriptive variables (age, BMI, sex and pack-years smoked) produced better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values than the questionnaires (ROC area=0.68). Conclusion 20% of randomly selected individuals who report respiratory symptoms in Canada have undiagnosed airflow obstruction due to asthma or COPD.

In the actinobacteria, including the streptomycetes and mycobacteria, the rapid resuscitation from a dormant state requires the activities of a family of cell-wall lytic enzymes called resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). Whether Rpf activity promotes resuscitation by generating peptidoglycan fragments (muropeptides) that function as signaling molecules for spore germination or by simply remodeling the dormant cell wall has been the subject of much debate. Here, to address this question, we used mutagenesis and peptidoglycan binding and cleavage assays to first gain broader insight into the biochemical function of diverse Rpf enzymes. We show that their LysM and LytM domains enhance Rpf enzyme activity; their LytM domain and, in some cases their LysM domain, also promoted peptidoglycan binding. We further demonstrate that the Rpfs function as endo-acting lytic transglycosylases, cleaving within the peptidoglycan backbone. We also found that unlike in other systems, Rpf activity in the streptomycetes is not correlated with peptidoglycan-responsive Ser/Thr kinases for cell signaling, and the germination of rpf mutant strains could not be stimulated by the addition of known germinants. Collectively, these results suggest that in Streptomyces, Rpfs have a structural rather than signaling function during spore germination, and that in the actinobacteria, any signaling function associated with spore resuscitation requires the activity of additional yet to be identified enzymes.",2020-07-03,Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://openalex.org/V140251998,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013994,9171,9182,295,27,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3027905019,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013994,journal-article,3027905019

The MAP is a longitudinal study that follows active case ﬁles of mid-adolescents in a large urban child protective services (CPS) system. The MAP is a unique opportunity to collect information from teens about their physical health (e.g., sleep quality), mental health (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) and cognitive style (e.g., attention, memory). The MAP study samples the population of CPS teens on questions that are used in provincial teen surveys, allowing for points of comparison to non-CPS teens. The MAP tracks youth development over 2.5 years. Although the MAP currently has a very small number of Aboriginal teens, the responses of these teens may focus practitioner and researcher attention to priority areas for further research. This includes the investigation of how some research issues, such as maltreatment history, personal safety, relationship to primary CPS worker and suicidal ideation, may be cross-informative. It is known that teen risk behaviours cluster together, but it is important to understand the relationships among these variables. An understanding of these relationships can drive knowledge creation, as well as practice and policy change.

In terms of imaging, this means obtaining a comprehensive illustration of bone, muscle, and fat tissues. There is currently a lack of a reliable resource for end users to learn about these tissues' imaging and quantification techniques together. An improved understanding of these tissues has been an important progression toward better prediction of disease outcomes and better elucidation of their interaction with frailty, aging, and metabolic disorders. Over the last decade, there have been major advances into the image acquisition and segmentation of bone, muscle, and fat features using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and peripheral modules of these systems. Dedicated peripheral quantitative musculoskeletal imaging systems have paved the way for mobile research units, lower cost clinical research facilities, and improved resolution per unit cost paid. The purpose of this review was to detail the segmentation techniques available for each of these peripheral CT and MRI modalities and to describe advances in segmentation methods as applied to study longitudinal changes and treatment-related dynamics.

The current study investigated whether and how the visual perspective from which a painful event is observed affects these ERP components. Participants viewed images of hands in pain vs. not in pain from a first-person or third-person perspective. We found that visual perspective influences both the early and late components. In the early component (N2), there was a larger mean amplitude during observation of pain vs no-pain exclusively when images were shown from a first-person perspective. We suggest that this effect may be driven by misattributing the on-screen hand to oneself. For the late component (P3), we found a larger effect of pain on mean amplitudes in response to third-person relative to first-person images. We speculate that the P3 may reflect a later process that enables effective recognition of others' pain in the absence of misattribution.

In three experiments employing distinct protocols, we allowed focal flies to fight for control of an attractive food patch over 4 days and then compared their survivorship to that of flies not engaged in conflict. In all three experiments, fly survivorship was lower in the aggression than no‐aggression treatments. Microscopic examination revealed no differences in wing damage between flies of the aggression and no‐aggression treatments. The two most likely, non‐mutually exclusive explanations for lower survivorship post‐fighting are physiological changes due to stress, and metabolic alterations associated with a life‐history strategy optimized for high‐conflict settings.",2020-01-01,Ethology,https://openalex.org/V147866836,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/eth.12956,24,31,126,1,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977303494,https://doi.org/10.1111/eth.12956,journal-article,2977303494

Objectives This study sought perspectives from health professionals with clinical/research expertise in chronic breathlessness on priority issues in chronic breathlessness explanations and research. Methods Authors (n = 74) of publications specific to chronic breathlessness were invited to a three-round Delphi survey. Responses to open-ended questions (Round 1 What is important to: include/avoid when explaining chronic breathlessness; prioritize in research?) were transformed to Likert scale (1–9) items for rating in subsequent rounds. A priori consensus was defined as ≥70% of respondents rating an item as important (Likert rating 7–9) and interquartile range ≤2. Results Of the 3 Round 1 respondents (nine countries, five professional disciplines), 2 (77%) completed Rounds  and 3. Sixty-three items met consensus (include n = 28; avoid n = 9; research n = 26). Explanations of chronic breathlessness should use patient-centered communication; acknowledge the distress, variability, and importance of this sensation; emphasize current management principles; clarify maladaptive beliefs and expectations; and avoid moral culpability and inappropriate reassurance. Research priorities included the need 1) for a comprehensive understanding of breathlessness science; 2) to optimize, explore, and develop effective interventions, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological; and 3) determine effective models of care including strategies for education and training of health professionals and people caring for, or living with, chronic breathlessness.

In June 2018, the federal government launched an Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, to report in 2019 on the best strategy to implement a national Pharmacare program that would provide all Canadians access to affordable outpatient prescription drugs. The Council was asked to consider three options: a universal public plan for all Canadians; a public catastrophic insurance plan that would kick off once spending on prescription drugs reaches a given threshold; and a more modest patching of existing gaps, providing coverage to those who are not eligible to any form of insurance. Beyond the relative consensus around the ideas that gaps in coverage should be filled to make drugs affordable to all, and that the costs of drugs are too high in Canada, the Council faces the challenge of addressing three underlying issues: 1) what amount of income redistribution will result from each of the three options; 2) how much savings would the implementation of a single payer generate? 3) what role restricting a national formulary would play in achieving those savings, and what would be the political consequences of narrowing the formulary?",2020-01-01,Health policy,https://openalex.org/V4210209709,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.10.006,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2984964423,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.10.006,journal-article,2984964423

If surgery is required, total abdominal colectomy (TAC) is most commonly performed. However, diverting loop ileostomy and colonic lavage have been recently developed as a potential colon-sparing approach to fulminant CDI. The aim of this review is to compare TAC and diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage for fulminant CDI.Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PubMed was performed. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they compared TAC and diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage. The primary outcome was postoperative mortality, and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. Quality of included studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.From 6 relevant citations,  studies (4 retrospective cohorts,  case series) with 368 patients were included. Compared to TAC, diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage did not significantly reduce overall mortality (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.99, P = 0.77), rate of reoperation (RR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.63, P = 0.94), or overall postoperative complications (RR 0.51, 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.17, P = 0.11). Rates of colonic preservation with the use of diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage ranged from 76% to 100%.There does not appear to be a survival advantage with the use of diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage compared to TAC for fulminant CDI.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov (January 1995–July 2019). We included studies comparing outcomes by vaginal birth or caesarean section in vertex infants born < 28 weeks or with birthweight < 1500 g. Two reviewers independently performed all steps. Primary outcomes were death and/or severe brain injury. We synthesised the data using random-effects meta-analyses (PROSPERO CRD42017074145). We included 1 studies with 129,475 infants. In vertex singletons < 28 weeks, caesarean section was associated with reduced adjusted odds of death (aOR 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39–0.99,  studies, 10,331 infants). For severe brain injury or a composite of death or severe brain injury, adjusted data were lacking. In infants with very low birth weight overall (< 1500 g) we found no significant benefit for our primary outcomes (e.g., death, aOR 0.77, 0.55–1.07,  studies, 105,439 infants), although there were some benefits associated with caesarean section in smaller weight subgroups (e.g., death aOR 500–700 g: 0.53, 0.49–0.57 [1 study, 598 infants] and 1000–1250 g: 0.78, 0.65–0.93 [1 study, 14,906 infants]), but not larger weights (1250–1500 g: 1.38, 1.15–1.65 [1 study, 17,715 infants]). Caesarean section was associated with a significant decrease in the adjusted odds of death in extremely preterm vertex infants < 28 weeks. Smaller birth weight subgroups supported these results.

Published studies demonstrated that a 70-km-wide zone of exhumed serpentinized mantle lies between oceanic crust and stretched continental crust at the seaward limit of Goban Spur. However, the along-strike extent of this serpentinized zone has, until now, been unknown due to insufficient data coverage. The crustal architecture of the margin is complicated due to its multi-staged tectonic history. Here, six newly acquired multi-channel seismic reflection lines are processed and interpreted, along with vintage seismic profiles, to characterize its structure and evolution. These seismic profiles reveal significant along-strike structural variations along the Goban Spur margin, and allow us to delimit five distinct crustal zones related to different rifting stages and their regional extents. The geometries of each crustal domain are variable along the margin strike, probably suggestive of different extension rates during the evolution of the margin or inherited variations in crustal composition and rheology. The transitional zone between oceanic crust and stretched continental crust consists of both shallow peridotite ridges and deeper exhumed serpentinized mantle, much like the conjugate Iberian and Newfoundland margins. Above the top basement in the exhumed domain, the syn-exhumed sediments show strikingly weak reflectivity, rarely seen at other magma-poor margins. Magmatic events occur coincident with each rifting stage, and the volume of magmatic accretions increases from NW to SE, more than previously interpreted. Plate reconstruction of the Goban Spur and its possible conjugate – the Flemish Cap, shows asymmetry in the crustal architectures, likely due to rift evolution involving more 3-D complexity than can be explained by simple 2-D extensional kinematics.",2020-02-20,Tectonophysics,https://openalex.org/V195250905,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2020.228364,228364,228364,777,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003177812,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2020.228364,journal-article,3003177812

One of the most serious complications experienced by patients with T2DM are skeletal diseases caused by changes in the bone microenvironment. As a result, patients with T2DM are at risk for higher prevalence of fragility fractures. There are a variety of treatments available for counteracting this effect. Some antidiabetic medications, such as metformin, have been shown to have a positive effect on bone health without the addition of additional drugs into patients’ treatment plans. Chinese randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies have also proposed antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies as a viable alternative treatment strategy. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses regarding this topic did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a two-part NMA that incorporates all available RCT data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antidiabetics (part I) and antiosteoporotic (part II) pharmacotherapies in terms of their ability to decrease fracture incidences, increase bone mineral density (BMD) and improve indications of bone turnover markers (BTMs) in adult patients with T2DM. Methods and analysis We will search Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Chinese literature sources (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP Information, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for RCTs, which fit our criteria. We will include adult patients with T2DM who have taken antidiabetics (part I) or antiosteoporotic (part II) therapies with relevant outcome measures in our study. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis in accordance to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report changes in BMD and BTMs in either weighted or standardised mean difference, and we will report fracture incidences as ORs. We will use the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve scores to provide numerical estimates of the rankings of interventions. Ethics and dissemination The study will not require ethics approval. The findings of the two-part NMA will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of T2DM bone disease. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with up-to-date recommendations for antidiabetic medications and antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies for maintaining bone health in patients with T2DM.

This study reported on claudin (Cldn) TJ protein transcripts of pre-metamorphic larval and post-metamorphic juvenile sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and the transcriptional response of genes encoding Cldns to changed environmental ion levels. Transcripts encoding Cldn-3b, -4, -5, -10, -14, -18 and -19 were identified, and mRNA expression profiles revealed the organ-specific presence of cldn- and -14, broad expression of cldn-3b, -4, -10, -18 and -19 and spatial differences in the mRNA abundance of cldn-4, -3b and -14 along the ammocoete intestine. Expression profiles were qualitatively similar in ammocoetes and juvenile fishes. Transcript abundance of genes encoding Cldns in osmoregulatory organs (gill, kidney, intestine and skin) was subsequently investigated after exposure of ammocoetes to ion-poor water (IPW) and juveniles to hyperosmotic conditions [60% sea water (SW)]. IPW-acclimated ammocoetes increased mRNA abundance of nearly all cldns in the gill. Simultaneously, cldn-1 abundance increased in the skin, whereas cldn-4, -14 and -18 decreased in the kidney. Ammocoete cldn mRNA abundance in the intestine was altered in a region-specific manner. In contrast, cldn transcript abundance was mostly downregulated in osmoregulatory organs of juvenile fish acclimated to SW  cldn-3b, -1 and -19 in the gill; cldn-3b, -4, -1 and -19 in the skin; cldn-3b in the kidney; and cldn-3b and -1 in the intestine. Data support the idea that Cldn TJ proteins play an important role in the osmoregulatory physiology of pre- and post-metamorphic sea lamprey and that Cldn participation can occur across organs, in an organ-specific manner, as well as differ spatially within organs, which contributes to the regulation of salt and water balance in these fishes.",2020-02-04,Journal of Fish Biology,https://openalex.org/V9351502,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14274,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005433844,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14274,journal-article,3005433844

It also provides heightened definitional rigour to the concept of resilience and in so doing, advances the concept of ‘resistance.’ We argue that resistance better characterizes regional economies and regionally-based industries whose competitive advantages have eroded, are resistant to change, and remain locked into trajectories of slow decline but persist through shocks, disruptions and interventions, policy-oriented or otherwise.

To date, there are no core domains or instruments for assessing PG severity in clinical trials, and current treatment paradigms rely on outcome measurements that have not been well characterized in the literature. Objectives To perform two systematic reviews that (i) identify the outcome measurement instruments used in PG clinical trials and their corresponding domains and (ii) identify any associated validation studies and evaluate their measurement properties and methodological quality. Methods We systematically searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for PG outcome measurement instruments. We also systematically searched for PG instrument validation studies. We evaluated the measurement properties and methodological quality of validation studies using the 201 COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Results In total, seven clinical trials were included. These studies utilized a total of 20 different instruments, including 1 physician-reported instruments, eight patient-reported instruments and one composite instrument. Among these, 85% of the instruments lacked any validation data. Of the remaining three validated instruments (speed of healing, physician global assessment and resolution of inflammation), methodological quality was not available for half of the COSMIN categories. Conclusions We identified 17 non-validated outcome measurement instruments used in PG clinical trials. We conclude that PG validation studies are required for existing instruments, and new instruments need to be developed to inform the consensus process for the development of a core outcome set for PG. Conclusions We report a modest increase in the incidence rate of BP, but show that the burden of disease in the elderly population is considerable. Mortality is high, particularly in the first  years after diagnosis. What is already known about this topic? Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare autoinflammatory skin condition that has been characterized by multiple outcome measurement instruments in clinical trials. However, there is no consensus on the most validated and appropriate outcome measurement instruments. What does this study add? This study identifies and evaluates 20 unique outcome measurement instruments for PG in the literature. Of these 20, 17 lack any instrument validation data, highlighting the need for future studies. What are the clinical implications of this work? Despite the current use of several outcome measurement instruments, future studies should explore the validation surrounding these instruments, as no instruments can currently be recommended.",2020-03-11,British Journal of Dermatology,https://openalex.org/V45720283,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19027,,,,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011167389,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19027,journal-article,3011167389

Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality [Health TAPESTRY] is a primary care intervention aimed at supporting older adults that involves trained volunteers, interprofessional teams, technology, and system navigation. This paper examines implementation of Health TAPESTRY in relation to interprofessional teamwork including volunteers. Methods This study applied Normalization Process Theory (NPT) and used a descriptive qualitative approach [1] embedded in a mixed-methods, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. It was situated in two primary care practice sites in a large urban setting in Ontario, Canada. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with primary care providers, clinical managers, administrative assistants, volunteers, and a volunteer coordinator. Data was collected at  months (June–July 2015) and 1 months (February–March 2016) after intervention start-up. Patients were interviewed at the end of the six-month intervention. Field notes were taken at weekly huddle meetings. Results Overall, 8 participants were included in 1 focus groups and 1 interviews; 2 field notes were collected. Themes were organized under four NPT constructs of implementation: 1) Coherence - (making sense/understanding of the program’s purpose/value) generating comprehensive assessments of older adults; strengthening health promotion, disease prevention, and self-management; enhancing patient-focused care; strengthening interprofessional care delivery; improving coordination of health and community services. 2) Cognitive Participation - (enrolment/buy-in) tackling new ways of working; attaining role clarity. 3) Collective Action - (enactment/operationalizing) changing team processes; reconfiguring resources. 4) Reflective Monitoring - (appraisal) improving teamwork and collaboration; reconfiguring roles and processes. Conclusions This study contributes key strategies for effective implementation of interventions involving interprofessional primary care teams. Findings indicate that regular communication among all team members, the development of procedures and/or protocols to support team processes, and ongoing review and feedback are critical to implementation of innovations involving primary care teams.

Advancements in proteomic methods have moved past the simple quantification of proteins to the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the ability to probe interactions between these proteins, spatially and temporally. Increased sensitivity and resolution of mass spectrometers and sample preparation protocols have drastically reduced the large amount of cells required and the experimental variability that had previously hindered its use in studying human neurological disorders. Proteomics offers a new perspective to study the altered molecular pathways and networks that are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The differences between the transcriptome and proteome, combined with the various types of post-translation modifications that regulate protein function and localization, highlight a novel level of research that has not been appropriately investigated. In this review, we will discuss strategies using proteomics to study ASD and other neurological disorders, with a focus on how these approaches can be combined with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) studies. Proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons have already been used to measure changes in the proteome caused by patient mutations, analyze changes in PTMs that resulted in altered biological pathways, and identify potential biomarkers. Further advancements in both proteomic techniques and human iPSC differentiation protocols will continue to push the field towards better understanding ASD disease pathophysiology.

A total of 30 participants (18–45 y) were included in body mass and composition analysis, and 24 were included in the strength analysis. A significant effect was found on TBM. However, there were no significant effects for FFM, FM, or strength outcomes.

Several frameworks exist to conceptualise healthcare systems, highlighting the stark contrast of frameworks unique to public health systems. The objectives of this study were to define public health systems and assess differences between healthcare systems and public health systems within established health systems frameworks. Methods A critical interpretive synthesis was conducted. Databases searched included EBSCOhost, OVID, Scholars Portal, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Health Systems Evidence. Data extraction, coding and analysis followed a best-fit framework analysis method. Initial codes were based on a current leading health systems and policy classification scheme – health systems arrangements (governance, financial and delivery arrangements). Results A total of 593 unique documents were identified and 6 were included in the analysis. Definitions of public health and public health systems varied significantly as did their roles and functions across jurisdictions. Public health systems arrangements generally followed those of health systems, with the addition of partnerships (community and inter-sectoral) and communication playing a larger role in public health. A public health systems framework and conceptualisation of how public health currently fits within health systems are presented. Conclusions Public health systems are unique and vital entities within health systems. In addition to examining how public health and public health systems have been defined within the literature, this review suggests that establishing the scope of public health is crucial to understanding its role within the larger health system and adds to the discourse around the relationship between public health, healthcare and population health. More broadly, this study addresses an important gap in understanding public health systems and provides conceptual and practical contributions as well as areas for future research.",2020-06-16,Health Research Policy and Systems,https://openalex.org/V201446958,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00583-z,,,18,1,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034736762,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00583-z,journal-article,3034736762

Understanding an affected channel member's locus of causality attributions for a destructive act can help the initiating firm determine when, where and how to proactively mitigate the adverse consequences of the act. We incorporate insights from interdependence and attribution theories to develop a theoretical framework of antecedents of locus of causality for such acts. We empirically evaluate our hypotheses using survey data from key informants on both sides of supplier-retailer dyads for a Fortune 500 company. We find that interdependence structure, perceived intensity and perceived frequency of destructive acts have implications for causal attributions made by the affected firm (retailer).

This study (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02070367) undertook preliminary investigation of the measurement properties of allodynography, a new standardized clinical examination procedure for mapping the area of cutaneous allodynia. Methods Persons with pain in one upper extremity after complex regional pain syndrome, a peripheral nerve injury, or who had recently experienced a hand fracture were recruited for assessment of static mechanical allodynia (based on perception of a 15g force stimulus delivered by Semmes-Weinstein monofilament #5.18 as painful) by two raters at baseline; the assessment was repeated one week later. Results Single-measures estimates suggested inter-rater reliability for allodynography was excellent at an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.9 (N = 12); test–retest reliability was also excellent at ICC = 0.8 (N = 10) for allodynography (P &amp;lt; 0.00 for both). Confidence intervals’ lower bounds confirm inter-rater reliability as excellent (0.90) but were less definitive for test–retest (0.59).

Such movement profiles are related to differences in sensorimotor integration and/or altered feedforward/feedback sensorimotor control. We investigated the processes underlying sensorimotor learning in autism by quantifying accuracy and variability, relative timing, and feedforward and feedback control. Although autistic individuals demonstrated significant sensorimotor learning across trials, which was facilitated by processing knowledge-of-results feedback, motor execution was less accurate than non-autistic individuals. Kinematic analysis indicated that autistic individuals showed significantly greater spatial variability at peak acceleration, but comparable spatial variability at peak velocity. These kinematic markers suggest that autistic movement profiles are driven by specific differences in sensorimotor control processes (i.e., internal action models) associated with planning and regulating the forces required to execute the movement. The reduction of variability at peak velocity indicates intact early feedback-based sensorimotor control in autism. Understanding how feedforward and feedback-based control processes operate provides an opportunity to explore how these control processes influence the acquisition of socio-motor actions in autism.

This study examines whether the association between neighbourhood SES and developmental health outcomes of Canadian kindergarten children is different for girls than for boys. Individual-level child development data, collected using the Early Development Instrument (EDI), were combined with neighbourhood-level socioeconomic data from Statistics Canada's Census and Tax Filer databases. Using an SES index comprising 10 socioeconomic variables, we show a significant cross-level interaction between neighbourhood SES and sex in relation to children's developmental outcomes: the neighbourhood SES gradient in child outcomes is steeper for males than for females. This finding was consistent across all five developmental domains measured by the EDI, for overall developmental health, and across geographical regions in Canada.

In order for the circumplanetary disk/rings to block the host star's light, the disk must be tilted out of the planet's orbital plane, which poses stability problems due to the radial extent of the disk required to explain the brightness dip durations. This work uses N-body integrations to study the structure and stability of circumplanetary disk/ring systems tilted out of the planet's orbital plane by the spinning planet's mass quadrupole. Simulating the disk as a collection of test particles with orbits initialized near the Laplace surface (equilibrium between tidal force from host star and force from planet's mass quadrupole), we find that many extended, inclined circumplanetary disks remain stable over the duration of the integrations (~3-16 Myr). Two dynamical resonances/instabilities excite the particle eccentricities and inclinations: the Lidov-Kozai effect which occurs in the disk's outer regions, and ivection resonance which occurs in the disk's inner regions.

Abstract We recently made the observation that there are significant alterations to the ultrastructure and functions of mitochondria in skeletal muscle of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). These alterations are proposed to lead to decreased energy production in skeletal muscle during exercise and thus may contribute to the impaired aerobic exercise capacity reported in some people with T1D.

Objective and Design We investigated whether deleterious mutations in MC4R contribute to obesity in Mexican children and adults. Results We provide evidence that the MC4R p.Ile269Asn (rs79783591) mutation may have arisen in modern human populations from a founder event in native Mexicans. The MC4R Isoleucine 26 is perfectly conserved across 18 species, which suggests a critical role for the amino acid in MC4R activity. Four in silico tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD, MutPred2) predicted a deleterious impact of the p.Ile269Asn substitution on MC4R function. The MC4R p.Ile269Asn mutation was associated with childhood (Ncontrols = 952, Ncases = 661, odds ratio (OR) = 3.06, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) [1.94–4.85]) and adult obesity (Ncontrols = 1445, Ncases = 2,487, OR = 2.58, 95%CI [1.52–4.39]). The frequency of the MC4R p.Ile269Asn mutation ranged from 0.52 to 0.59% and 1.53 to 1.59% in children and adults with normal weight and obesity, respectively. The MC4R p.Ile269Asn mutation co-segregated perfectly with obesity in  multigenerational Mexican pedigrees. While adults with obesity carrying the p.Ile269Asn mutation had higher BMI values than noncarriers, this trend was not observed in children. The MC4R p.Ile269Asn mutation accounted for a population attributable risk of 1.28% and 0.68% for childhood and adult obesity, respectively, in the Mexican population.

Cardiac donation after circulatory determination of death (cardiac DCDD) can be performed using direct procurement and perfusion (DPP), where cardiac activity is restored after heart recovery, or (NRP), where brain blood supply is surgically interrupted, circulation to the thoraco-abdominal organs is restored within the donor’s body, followed by heart recovery. While cardiac DCDD would increase the number of heart donors, uptake of programs has been slowed in part because of ethical concerns within the medical community. These debates have been largely devoid of discussion regarding public perceptions. We conducted a national survey of public perceptions regarding cardiac DCDD. We surveyed 1,001 Canadians about their attitudes towards cardiac DCDD using a rigorously designed and pre-tested survey. We found that 84 of 1,001 respondents (84.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 81.8 to 86.3) accepted the DPP approach, 64 (64.1%; 95% CI, 61.1 to 67.0) would agree to donate their heart using DPP, and 69 (69.5%; 95% CI, 66.6 to 72.3) would consent to the same for a family member.

EDPs are implemented in high and middle income countries and thought to improve the quality, consistency, and transparency of decisions informed by health technology assessment (HTA). Together these would ultimately improve the legitimacy of any decision making process. We argue—based on our previous work and in light of the priority setting literature—that EDPs are relevant and feasible within LICs. The extreme lack of resources necessitates making tough decisions which may mean depriving populations of potentially valuable health technologies. It is critical that the decisions and the decision making bodies are perceived as fair and legitimate by the people that are most affected by the decisions. EDPs are well aligned with the political infrastructure in some LICs, which encourages public participation in decision making. Furthermore, many countries are committed to evidence-informed decision making. However, the application of EDPs may be hampered by the limited availability of evidence of good quality, lack of interest in transparency and accountability (in some LICs), limited capacity to conduct HTA, as well as limited time and financial resources to invest in a deliberative process. While EDPs would potentially benefit many LICs, mitigating the identified potential barriers would strengthen their applicability. We believe that implementation studies in LICs, documenting the contextualized enablers and barriers will facilitate the development of context specific improvement strategies for EDPs.",2020-01-16,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care,https://openalex.org/V83891556,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462319003398,29,33,36,1,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000331816,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462319003398,journal-article,3000331816

We employed a novel layered treatment design to investigate whether cortical thickness features at baseline differentiated treatment responders from non-responders after 8 and 16 weeks of a standardized sequential antidepressant treatment. Secondary analyses examined baseline differences between MDD and controls as a replication analysis and longitudinal changes in thickness after 8 weeks of escitalopram treatment. 18 MDD and  healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. After 8 weeks of escitalopram treatment (10–20 mg/d, flexible dosage), responders (>50% decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale score) were continued on escitalopram; non-responders received adjunctive aripiprazole (2–10 mg/d, flexible dosage). MDD participants were classified into subgroups according to their response profiles at weeks 8 and 16. Baseline group differences in cortical thickness were analyzed with FreeSurfer between HC and MDD groups as well as between response groups. Two-stage longitudinal processing was used to investigate 8-week escitalopram treatment-related changes in cortical thickness.

Research is needed that identifies area-level characteristics that can inform strategies for reducing unmet need in the population. The study purpose is to: (1) estimate area-level variation in children’s unmet need for mental health services (using Service Areas as defined by the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services), and (2) identify area-level service arrangements, and geographic and population characteristics associated with unmet need. Using individual-level general population data, area-level government administrative data and Census data from Ontario, Canada, we use multilevel regression models to analyze unmet need for mental health services among children (level 1) nested within Service Areas (level 2). The study finds that 1.64% of the reliable variance in unmet need for mental health services is attributable to between-area differences. Across areas, we find that Service Areas with more agencies had a lower likelihood of unmet need for mental health services. Compared to other Service Areas, Toronto had much lower likelihood of unmet need compared to the rest of Ontario. Rural areas, areas with unsatisfactory public transport, and areas with higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage had a higher likelihood of unmet need for mental health services.

We investigated evolved variation in hypoxia tolerance and the hypoxia acclimation response across fundulid killifishes that naturally experience different patterns of hypoxia exposure. We compared resting O2 consumption rate (MO2), and various indices of hypoxia tolerance (critical O2 tension [Pcrit], regulation index [RI], O2 tension [PO2] at loss of equilibrium [PLOE], and time to LOE [tLOE] at 0.6 kPa O2) in Fundulus confluentus, F. diaphanus, F. heteroclitus, F. rathbuni, Lucania goodei, and L. parva. We examined the effects of chronic (2 d) exposure to constant hypoxia ( kPa) or nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (1 h normoxia: 12 h hypoxia) in a subset of species. Some species exhibited a two-breakpoint model in MO2 caused by early, modest declines in MO2 in moderate hypoxia. We found that hypoxia tolerance varied appreciably across species: F. confluentus was the most tolerant (lowest PLOE and Pcrit, longest tLOE), whereas F. rathbuni and F. diaphanus were the least tolerant. However, there was not a consistent pattern of interspecific variation for different indices of hypoxia tolerance, with or without taking phylogenetic relatedness into account, likely because these different indices are underlaid by partially distinct mechanisms. Hypoxia acclimation generally improved hypoxia tolerance, but the magnitude of plasticity and responsiveness to different hypoxia patterns varied interspecifically.

Some of these patients develop intracranial bleeding. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of intracranial bleeding and the associated clinical features in older adults who present to the ED after falling. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Three Canadian EDs. PARTICIPANTS A total of  17 patients age 65 years or older who presented to the ED with a fall were assessed, and 1753 were included. Inclusion criteria were a fall on level ground, off a bed, chair, or toilet, or from one or two steps within 48 hours. MEASUREMENTS Emergency physicians recorded predefined clinical findings on initial assessment. The primary outcome was intracranial bleeding, diagnosed either by computed tomography at the index visit or within 42 days. Associations between baseline clinical findings and the presence of intracranial bleeding were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 1753 patients (median age = 8 y) were enrolled, of whom 39% were male, 35% were on antiplatelet therapy, and 25% were on an anticoagulant. The incidence of intracranial bleeding was 5.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-6.1). Overall, 7 patients were diagnosed at the index ED visit, and 1 were diagnosed during follow-up. Multivariable regression identified four clinical variables that were independently associated with intracranial bleeding: new abnormalities on neurologic examination (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.4-8.1), bruise or laceration on the head (OR = 4.3; 95% CI = 2.7-7.0), chronic kidney disease (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.3-4.6), and reduced Glasgow Coma Scale from normal (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.0-3.4). CONCLUSION The incidence of intracranial bleeding in our study was 5.0%. We found significant associations between intracranial bleeding and four simple clinical variables.

Regardless of altitude, all eight populations maintained O2 consumption rate with minimal change in heart rate or O2 pulse, indicating that O2 consumption was maintained by either a constant arterial-venous O2 content difference (an increase in the relative O2 extracted from arterial blood) or by a combination of changes in stroke volume and the arterial-venous O2 content difference. Three high-altitude taxa (yellow-billed pintails, cinnamon teal, and speckled teal) had higher Hct and [Hb], increasing the O2 content of arterial blood, and potentially providing a greater reserve for enhancing O2 delivery during hypoxia. Hct and [Hb] between low- and high-altitude populations of ruddy duck were similar, representing a potential adaptation to diving life. Heart rate variability was generally lower in high-altitude ducks, concurrent with similar or lower heart rates than low-altitude ducks, suggesting a reduction in vagal and sympathetic tone. These unique features of the Andean ducks differ from previous observations in both Andean geese and bar-headed geese, neither of which exhibit significant elevations in Hct or [Hb] compared to their low-altitude relatives, revealing yet another avian strategy for coping with high altitude.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,https://openalex.org/V20257348,The Company of Biologists,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.211250,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005958654,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.211250,journal-article,3005958654

This study investigates the creation of dual-scale topography on Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-3Cr (Ti5553), an alloy not presently used in the biomedical field, and compares it to Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64), the most used T alloy for bone implants. Dual-scale surface topography was obtained by combining selective laser melting (SLM) and electrochemical anodization, which resulted in micro- and nanoscale surface features, respectively. Ti5553 and Ti64 samples were manufactured by SLM and showed comparable surface topography. Subsequent electrochemical anodization succeeded in forming titania nanotubes (TNTs) on both alloys, with larger nanotubes obtained with Ti5553 at all investigated anodization voltages. At an anodization voltage of 4 V, a minimum time of 2 min was necessary to have nanotube formation on the surface of either alloy, while only nanopores were evident for shorter times. Seeded Saos-2 cells showed ideal interactions with surface-modified structures, with filopodia extending to both surface microparticles characteristic of SLM and to the interior of TNTs. Attractiveness of Ti5553 lies in its lower elastic modulus (E = 7 GPa) compared to Ti64, which should mitigate stress-shielding phenomena in vivo. This, combined with the analogous results obtained in terms of dual-scale surface topography and cell-substrate interaction, could indicate Ti5553 as a promising alternative to the widely-employed Ti64 for bone implant device manufacturing.",2020-03-20,Nanotechnology,https://openalex.org/V206811868,IOP Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab79ac,235101,235101,31,23,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007728089,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab79ac,journal-article,3007728089

In this context, identifying and characterizing discrete mobility profiles through the classification of people’s behavior is particularly attractive. By facilitating the interpretation of complex, multidimensional processes, such an exercise could help to efficiently target transport policy decisions. The purpose of this paper is to identify mobility strategy profiles considering four key dimensions: time, space, money, and social interaction. Data from a seven-day activity, travel, expenditure, and social interaction diary applied to a sample of residents from the city of Concepcion, Chile, is used. A two-step approach based on machine learning techniques is adopted. First, we use a Self-Organizing Map algorithm to identify seven distinct mobility strategies, each characterized by distinctive behaviors. These profiles are identified through 18 weekday and weekend daily behavior variables measuring the four key dimensions mentioned above, with an explicit focus on transport mode use. In the second step, we use a Decision Tree algorithm to profile the mobility strategies by means of personal and household sociodemographic variables. The results show interesting links among the dimensions of analysis within these profiles, such as connections between monetary expenditure on leisure and daily social interaction, and that profiles with higher private vehicle modal split tend to present higher levels of social interaction with people in their social network than public transit users.",2020-07-01,Travel behaviour and society,https://openalex.org/V2764874763,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.02.004,1,11,20,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008250477,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.02.004,journal-article,3008250477

However, preclinical models of the placental barrier often lacked the multiple cell layers, syncytialization of the trophoblast cells and the low oxygen levels that are present within the body. Therefore, we aimed to design and develop an in vitro model of the placental barrier that would reinstate these factors and enable improved investigations of barrier function. BeWo placental trophoblastic cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were co-cultured on contralateral sides of an extracellular matrix-coated transwell insert to establish a multilayered barrier. Epidermal growth factor and forskolin led to significantly increased multi-nucleation of the BeWo cell layer and increased biochemical markers of syncytial fusion, for example syncytin-1 and hCGβ. Our in vitro placental barrier possessed size-specific permeability, with 4000-Da molecules experiencing greater transport and a lower apparent permeability coefficient than 70 000-Da molecules. We further demonstrated that the BeWo layer had greater resistance to smaller molecules compared to the endothelial layer. Chronic, physiologically low oxygen exposure (3–8%) increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and syncytin-1, further increased multi-nucleation of the BeWo cell layer and decreased barrier permeability only against smaller molecules (457 Da/4000 Da). In conclusion, we built a novel in vitro co-culture model of the placental barrier that possessed size-specific permeability and could function under physiologically low oxygen levels. Importantly, this will enable future researchers to better study the maternal–fetal transport of nutrients and drugs during pregnancy.",2020-05-15,Molecular human reproduction,https://openalex.org/V4210190516,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa018,353,365,26,5,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010672586,https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa018,journal-article,3010672586

Of particular importance are those that disrupt the plasma membrane, since loss of membrane integrity can lead to cell death. Currently, quantitative assays to detect membrane-disrupting (lytic) agents are done offsite, leading to long turnaround times and high costs, while existing colorimetric point-of-need solutions often sacrifice sensitivity. Thus, portable and highly sensitive solutions are needed to detect lytic agents for health and environmental monitoring. Here, a lipid-based electrochemical sensing platform is introduced to rapidly detect membrane-disrupting agents. The platform combines benchtop fabricated microstructured electrodes (MSEs) with lipid membranes. The sensing mechanism of the lipid-based platform relies on stacked lipid membranes serving as passivating layers that when disrupted generate electrochemical signals proportional to the membrane damage. The MSE topography, membrane casting and annealing conditions were optimized to yield the most reproducible and sensitive devices. We used the sensors to detect membrane-disrupting agents sodium dodecyl sulfate and Polymyxin-B within minutes and with limits of detection in the ppm regime.

One explanation for this trait—and the one tested here—is that synesthesia results from unusually weak pruning of cortical synaptic hyperconnectivity during early perceptual development. We tested the prediction from this hypothesis that synesthetes would be superior at making discriminations from nonnative categories that are normally weakened by experience-dependent pruning during a critical period early in development—namely, discrimination among nonnative phonemes (Hindi retroflex /d̪a/ and dental /ɖa/), among chimpanzee faces, and among inverted human faces. Like the superiority of 6-mo-old infants over older infants, the synesthetic groups were significantly better than control groups at making all the nonnative discriminations across five samples and three testing sites. The consistent superiority of the synesthetic groups in making discriminations that are normally eliminated during infancy suggests that residual cortical connectivity in synesthesia supports changes in perception that extend beyond the specific synesthetic percepts, consistent with the incomplete pruning hypothesis.",2020-05-05,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1914668117,10089,10096,117,18,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3019110705,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1914668117,journal-article,3019110705

In hypoxia, changes in gill blood flow patterns and functional surface area that increase gas transfer can promote an exacerbation in ion and water fluxes. Our goal was to determine whether the osmorespiratory compromise is flexible, depending on environmental salinity (fresh, isosmotic and sea water) and oxygen levels (hypoxia) in euryhaline killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Plasma ion concentrations were minimally affected by hypoxia, indicating a maintenance of osmoregulatory homeostasis. In FW-killifish, hypoxia exposure reduced branchial Na+/K+-ATPase and NEM-sensitive-ATPase activities, as well as diffusive water flux rates. Unidirectional Na+ influx and Na+ efflux decreased during hypoxia in FW, but net Na+ flux remained unchanged. Net loss rates of Cl−, K+ and ammonia were also attenuated in hypoxia, suggesting both transcellular and paracellular reductions in permeability. These reductions appeared to be regulated phenomena as fluxes were restored immediately in normoxia. Na+ flux rates increased during hypoxia in 1 ppt, but decreased in 3 ppt, the latter suggesting a similar response to hypoxia as in FW. In summary, FW- and SW-killifish experience a reduction in gill permeability, as seen in other hypoxia-tolerant species. Fish acclimated to isosmotic salinity increased Na+ influx and efflux rates, as well as paracellular permeability in hypoxia, responses in accord with the predictions of the classic osmorespiratory compromise.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,https://openalex.org/V20257348,The Company of Biologists,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.216309,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3030735585,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.216309,journal-article,3030735585

As a consequence, improving water use efficiency by crops has become an important objective for crop improvement. Some wild crop relatives have adapted to extreme osmotic stresses and can provide valuable insights into traits and genetic signatures that can guide efforts to improve crop tolerance to water deficits. Eutrema salsugineum , a close relative of many cruciferous crops, is a halophytic plant and extremophyte model for abiotic stress research. Results Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that two E. salsugineum ecotypes display significantly different transcriptional responses towards a two-stage drought treatment. Even before visibly wilting, water deficit led to the differential expression of almost 1,10 genes for an ecotype from the semi-arid, sub-arctic Yukon, Canada, but only 6 genes for an ecotype from the semi-tropical, monsoonal, Shandong, China. After recovery and a second drought treatment, about 5,000 differentially expressed genes were detected in Shandong plants versus 1,90 genes in Yukon plants. Only 1 genes displayed similar drought-responsive patterns for both ecotypes. We detected 1,00 long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 8% were only expressed in stress-treated plants, a surprising outcome given the documented association between lncRNA expression and stress. Co-expression network analysis of the transcriptomes identified eight gene clusters where at least half of the genes in each cluster were differentially expressed. While many gene clusters were correlated to drought treatments, only a single cluster significantly correlated to drought exposure in both ecotypes. Conclusion Extensive, ecotype-specific transcriptional reprogramming with drought was unexpected given that both ecotypes are adapted to saline habitats providing persistent exposure to osmotic stress. This ecotype-specific response would have escaped notice had we used a single exposure to water deficit. Finally, the apparent capacity to improve tolerance and growth after a drought episode represents an important adaptive trait for a plant that thrives under semi-arid Yukon conditions, and may be similarly advantageous for crop species experiencing stresses attributed to climate change.",2020-06-08,BMC Genomics,https://openalex.org/V28614077,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06793-7,,,21,1,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034045599,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06793-7,journal-article,3034045599

We conducted a retrospective analysis of a combined data set from these trials to identify a benefit in subsets of patients according to prognostic risk factors. The prognostic ability of factors to predict survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Evaluation of potential beneficial subsets was performed using interaction terms between factors and cabozantinib. All tests were two-sided and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 1147 post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC were available (1028 from COMET-1 and 11 from COMET-2). The following factors were prognostic for OS: age, disease-free interval, hemoglobin, prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, bone scan lesion area, lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and pain (all p < 0.05). There was no interaction effect on survival between cabozantinib versus comparator arms and any prognostic group. After adjusting for prognostic factors, cabozantinib was associated with better OS (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.67–0.95; p = 0.012). Further investigation of cabozantinib in a better-powered trial or a rational patient population based on a molecular biomarker may be warranted.

The present study examined this effect further by addressing two issues. First, we examined whether this effect is sensitive to the list context in which congruent and incongruent items are presented. In Experiment 1, this issue was addressed by manipulating the relative proportions of congruent and incongruent trials in the study phase. In Experiments 2A and 2B, the same issue was examined by contrasting randomly intermixed and blocked manipulations of congruency. The results of these experiments, as well as a trial-to-trial sequence analysis, demonstrate that the recognition advantage for incongruent over congruent items is robust and remarkably insensitive to list context. Second, we examined recognition of incongruent and congruent items relative to a single word baseline condition. Incongruent (Experiment 3A) and congruent (Experiment 3B) items were both better recognized than single word items, though this effect was substantially stronger for incongruent items. These results suggest that perceptual processing difficulty, rather than interference caused by different target and distractor identities on its own, contributes to the enhanced recognition of incongruent items. Together, the results demonstrate that processes that are sensitive to perceptual processing difficulty of items but largely insensitive to list context produce heightened recognition sensitivity for incongruent targets.",2020-07-01,Psychological Research-psychologische Forschung,https://openalex.org/V35819839,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-019-01153-x,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2915858787,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-019-01153-x,journal-article,2915858787

Methods An extensive computerized database search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed; all trials involving n ≥ 2 patients, aged 1 years and older undergoing a primary, open rhinoplasty procedure, were included for review. Results Of the 323 citations initially screened, 7 studies met the stated inclusion criteria. A total of 5 unique outcomes and 5 postoperative outcome measures were identified. Outcomes were divided into  unique domains: objective signs, subjective symptom severity, physical function related to activities of daily living, patient satisfaction, surgeon satisfaction, and quality of life. The identified outcome measures consisted of 5 nasal-specific, author-reported instruments; 5 nasal specific, patient-reported instruments;  patient-reported, generic instruments; and  author-generated instruments. Of the outcome measures identified, the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22, and FACE-Q were the only instruments to demonstrate adequate validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change in patients who underwent a rhinoplasty procedure.

In this paper, we investigate the data-driven modeling of SCR systems and outlet NO $_{x}$ concentration estimation based on the developed data-driven model and the algorithm of unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) filtering. The structure used for the data-driven model is an autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model and the method of partial least square is utilized to identify the parameters of the corresponding ARX model. Moreover, the approach of fuzzy c-means is employed to partition the data and derive multiple local linear models with a better performance on approximating the system nonlinearities. Finally, the algorithm of UFIR filtering is adopted to estimate the outlet NO $_{x}$ concentration due to its strong robustness without the statistics of process and measurement noises. The performance of proposed approaches on SCR systems is validated with simulations based on experimental data. In addition, comparisons show the improvement of the adopted algorithm on the estimation accuracy.",2020-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,https://openalex.org/V58031724,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tie.2019.2924880,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2957877107,https://doi.org/10.1109/tie.2019.2924880,journal-article,2957877107

However, directly using available noise-corrupted destination information in the existing destination constrained filtering methods may lead to performance degradation. To address this limitation, in this paper, the true destination is also treated as a state to be estimated along with the target state. Then, the destination constraint information is leveraged by using the relationship between the state components and a newly constructed pseudo-measurement. An uncertain destination constrained augmented state filter (UDC-ASF) with its state being augmented by destination, in which the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to deal with the strong nonlinearity of the measurements, is proposed to produce both constrained target state and destination estimates. Moreover, the unknown slope and the intercept of the straightline representing the destination constraint can also be augmented into the state vector and two pseudo-measurements are constructed in the process. The corresponding UDC-ASF with slope and intercept (UDC-ASF-SI) is derived. The a priori noisy destination is used to initialize the two proposed filters. An extension of the UDC-ASF to track multiple targets heading to the same destination is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",2020-01-01,Signal Processing,https://openalex.org/V154637859,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.07.019,107226,107226,166,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2960788939,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.07.019,journal-article,2960788939

The 3 Magee equations, Gage Algorithm, and University of Tennessee predictive algorithm all use standard clinicopathologic data to provide surrogate ODX scores. In this hypothesis-generating study, we evaluated whether these prognostic scores could be used to identify patients unlikely to benefit from additional ODX testing. Patients and Methods Retrospective data was collected from 30 patients with invasive ductal breast cancer and available ODX scores. Additional data was available for: Magee equations 1 (212 patients),  (299 patients), 3 (212 patients), Gage Algorithm (299 patients), and University of Tennessee predictive algorithm (28 patients). ODX scores were banded according to the TAILORx results. Results Correlation with ODX scores was between 0. and 0.8 (Gage), 0.8 and 0.9 (Magee 2, University of Tennessee predictive algorithm), and > 0.9 (Magee 1 and 3). Magee 3 was the most robust and is proposed as a screening tool: for patients aged ≤ 5 years, ODX testing would be not required if the Magee 3 score was  5 years, ODX would not be required if the Magee 3 score was  Conclusions Use of all formulae, and the Magee 3 equation in particular, are proposed as possible screening tools for ODX testing, resulting in significantly reduced frequency of ODX testing.

To investigate the psychometric properties of the five-item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-5) and the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-Screen (GSIS-Screen, submitted) among community-residing middle-aged and older men.Methods. The SBQ-5 and GSIS-Screen were administered to 9 men, 5 years or older, who participated in an eligibility assessment (Time 1) for an upstream psychological intervention study to prevent the onset of suicide ideation among men struggling to transition to retirement. Eligible participants later completed the full GSIS and measures of depression and hopelessness at a pre-group assessment (Time 2).Results. The SBQ-5 was positively associated with the GSIS-Screen at the eligibility assessment. Internal consistency for both measures was low but acceptable. Time  scores on both screens predicted suicide ideation at Time 2, controlling for the intervening time lag and for baseline cognitive and physical functioning. Only the GSIS-Screen uniquely predicted future depression and hopelessness ratings.Conclusions. The SBQ-5 and the GSIS-Screen have acceptable psychometric properties among middle-aged and older community-residing men; the GSIS-Screen is more closely associated with later-life suicide risk factors.Clinical Implications.

Hypotheses and models describe how small-scale feedbacks among vegetation, hydrology, and nutrients cause spatial differences in peat accumulation that enable microforms and surface patterns to develop over time. Empirical tests of the predictions from theoretical models of these proposed feedback mechanisms are limited, particularly in large peatland complexes such as the HBL. We investigate feedbacks controlling peatland structure and function in an ombrogenous bog and a minerogenous fen in the HBL. Our sites represent surface patterns found in many northern peatlands, specifically spatially irregular hummocks and hollows, and parallel ridges and pools that are perpendicular to slope. We found the occurrence of different spatial patterns depends on position within a peat landform, with these differences attributed to the ecohydrological setting. In turn, the ecohydrological setting, with different water table depths, nutrient availability, and species composition, influences the strength and direction of feedback mechanisms at the microform scale. Our data support the prediction of a positive feedback between plant productivity and acrotelm thickness for peat accumulation and hummock growth and that this may be enhanced by water ponding on slopes to form ridge–pool tracks. We did not find evidence to support the proposed feedback among evapotranspiration-driven transport of water and nutrients for the development of hummocks.

The composition of the microbiome in IF represents an important variable in the physiology and prognosis of this disease. AIM We sought to compare the intestinal microbiome and SCFA concentration of children who require parenteral nutrition (PN) with that of children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) who have discontinued PN and with age-matched controls, using high-throughput sequencing to investigate host-microbe interactions. METHODS Fifty-three samples were submitted over 6-15 months. Six children with SBS + IF submitted 3 samples, and  children with SBS with discontinued PN submitted 1 samples; these were compared with samples from  control children. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA partial gene sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer. SCFAs were measured in stool samples by mass spectrometry. RESULTS Butyrate quantity was near absent in children with IF compared with that in controls (median 0.37 nmol/mg vs 10.92 nmol/mg; P < .0001). Similarly, commensal anaerobes known to produce SCFA, including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, were reduced in those with SBS. SBS + IF enteric samples demonstrated a 168-fold increase in the relative abundance of the Escherichia genus seemingly attributable to the species Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION The reduced relative abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridia as well as decreased intestinal butyrate concentration in children with IF support further investigation in therapeutic options that target butyrate-producing bacterial communities or butyrate supplementation.",2020-08-01,Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,https://openalex.org/V100343354,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/jpen.1715,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982142125,https://doi.org/10.1002/jpen.1715,journal-article,2982142125

It is unknown whether elderly patients without implanted devices have a similar prevalence of undiagnosed AF using non-invasive ECG monitoring, and if this approach to screening in this population is cost-effective. Methods Individuals ≥80 years old attending outpatient clinics without a history of AF and with hypertension and one additional risk factor underwent 30 days of continuous ECG monitoring with an option for an additional 30 days of monitoring if no AF was detected. The primary outcome was AF ≥ 6 min. Cost-effectiveness to prevent stroke was estimated using a Markov model based on observed AF detection rates and data from the published literature. Results Among 12 patients enrolled, 10 initiated monitoring for an average duration of 36 ± 21 days. The proportion of patients that completed at least 30 days of monitoring was 59%. Average age was 84 ± 3 years and mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.5 ± 1.2. AF ≥ 6 min was documented in 14%, ≥6 h in 8%, and ≥24 h in 3%. One week of monitoring costed $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year-gained, 30 days and 60 days of monitoring costed $70,000 and $84,000, respectively.

Larvae of lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) demonstrate the so-called cryptonephric arrangement, where the distal blind end of each MT is embedded into the rectal complex. The rest of the free tubule is modified into several distinct regions that differ greatly in the transport of cations and water. However, relatively little is known about the transport of counter-anions (e.g., Cl- and HCO3-) by the MTs of lepidopteran larvae. In the current study we used ion-selective microelectrodes to characterize Cl- transport in the distinct regions of the free MT of the larval Trichoplusia ni. Firstly, we note that Cl- transport in the MTs is sensitive to the Cl- concentration of the bathing saline, and several regions of the MTs are capable of either secreting or reabsorbing Cl-. In the distal ileac plexus (DIP), a region previously characterized by cellular heterogeneity and its ability to switch between cation secretion and reabsorption, principal cells (PCs) toggled between Cl- reabsorption (in high-Cl- saline) and Cl- secretion (in low-Cl- saline). In contrast, secondary cells (SCs) in the DIP secreted Cl- regardless of saline Cl- concentration. Mechanistically, we have detected a number of 'leak' and ligand-gated Cl- channels (ClC) and demonstrated that Cl- channels are involved in Cl- secretion. Additionally, we demonstrated that the lumen-positive transepithelial potential increased in response to glycine. Using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique we demonstrated that glycine stimulated Cl- secretion by SCs, but not by PCs. In contrast, when MTs were deprived of glycine, a decrease in Cl- secretion, coupled with a decrease in the TEP, was observed. In contrast to the effects of glycine, an active dose of helicokinin reduced Cl- secretion by PCs, but not by SCs. Lastly, we detected expression of chloride-bicarbonate exchangers (CBE) in all regions of the free tubule. Scans of H+ transport across the tubule indicated that base equivalents are likely reabsorbed across the ileac plexus. Blocking ClC or CBE led to secretion of a more basic fluid, indicating lack of base reabsorption. We suggest that the transport of Cl- in the MTs of larval lepidopterans (i) may be correlated with the reabsorption of base, (ii) may be sensitive to Cl- concentration in the haemolymph, and (iii) could be regulated by helicokinin and glycine.",2020-01-01,Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,https://openalex.org/V130917594,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103263,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983089134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103263,journal-article,2983089134

Escherichia coli is recovered in the sputum of up to 25% of patients with CF, yet little is known about the epidemiology or clinical impact of infection.We studied patients attending a Canadian adult CF clinic who had positive sputum cultures for E coli from 1978 to 2016. Infection was categorized as transient or persistent (≥3 positive sputum cultures, spanning >6 months). Those with persistent infection were matched 2:1 with age, sex, and time-period controls without history of E coli infection, and mixed-effects models were used to assess pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) frequency, lung function decline, hospitalization, and intravenous antibiotic days.Forty-five patients (12.3%) had E coli recovered from sputum samples between 1978 and 2016, and 1 patients (40%) developed persistent infection. Nine patients (24%) had PEx at incident infection, and increased bioburden was predictive of exacerbation (P = .03). Risk factors for persistent infection included lower nutritional status (P < .001) and lower lung function (P = .009), but chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was protective. There was no difference in annual lung function decline, need for hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics, or risk of PEx in patients with persistent infection.Persistent E coli infection was frequent and was more common in CF patients with low nutritional status and lung function.

In pregnant long-haul travellers, little is known in terms of the absolute risk of VTE in these women and, therefore, there is limited consensus on appropriate thromboprophylaxis in this setting. Objective This review will provide guidance to allow practitioners to safely minimize the risk of travel-related VTE in pregnant women. The suggestions provided are based on limited data, extrapolated risk estimates of VTE in pregnant travellers and recommendations from published guidelines. Results We found that the absolute VTE risk per flight appears to be &amp;lt;1% for the average pregnant or postpartum traveller. In pregnant travellers with a prior history of VTE, a potent thrombophilia or strong antepartum risk factors (e.g. combination of obesity and immobility), the risk of VTE with travel appears to be &amp;gt;1%. Postpartum, the risk of VTE with travel may be &amp;gt;1% for women with thrombophilias (particularly in those with a family history) and other transient risk factors and in women with a prior VTE. Conclusions Based on our findings, we recommend simple measures be taken by all pregnant travellers, such as frequent ambulation, hydration and calf exercises. In those at an intermediate risk, we suggest a consideration of 20–30 mmHg compression stockings. In the highest risk group, we suggest careful consideration for low-molecular-weight heparin thromboprophylaxis.

These haploid yeasts can hybridise in nature, giving rise to AD hybrids that are predominantly diploid or aneuploid. Despite their increasing prevalence in clinical settings, much remains unknown about the allelic distribution patterns in AD hybrid strains.This study aims to characterise allele distributions in AD hybrids derived from the same basidium as well as from multiple basidia in a laboratory-derived C neoformans × C deneoformans hybrid cross.We dissected a total of 162 basidiospores from 3 basidia. The 297 basidiospores that successfully germinated were genotyped by molecular characterisation of 3 markers using PCR-RFLP, with at least two markers on each of the 1 chromosomes in the genome.Of the 297 strains, 29 contained at least one heterozygous locus, with a mean heterozygosity of ~30% per strain. Most hybrid genomes and chromosomes displayed significantly distorted allele distributions, with offspring originating from the same basidium tended to have alleles at different loci from the same parent. More basidia were skewed in favour of C deneoformans alleles, the mitochondria-donor parent, than the C neoformans alleles.The divergence between C neoformans and C deneoformans genomes has likely created co-adapted allelic combinations, with their co-segregation in hybrid offspring imparting a significant fitness benefit.

Biomechanical risk factors can alter tendon-SSCT shear strain but the effects of external mechanical compression and localized ischemia have yet to be investigated. In a laboratory study with 1 healthy participants, color Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to quantify relative motion between the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon and SSCT during repetitive finger flexion-extension under various conditions of external mechanical compression (palmar and forearm compression), ischemia and different movement speeds (0.75 and 1.25 Hz). Forearm compression reduced tendon displacement (baseline = 28.5 ± 4. mm vs. forearm = 27.0 ± 4. mm; p = 0.043) and showed a trend for reduced SSCT displacement, while palmar compression had no significant effects on tendon-SSCT motion. Compared with baseline, partial ischemia decreased SSCT displacement (baseline = 22. ± 3.3 mm vs. ischemia = 22. ± 3.3 mm; p = 0.015), while tendon displacement remained unchanged. In all experimental conditions, faster movements elicited greater tendon-SSCT relative motion. Our findings suggest that palmar compression may not negatively impact tendon-SSCT relative motion, but forearm compression may require further investigation. Localized ischemia in the forearm may alter the gliding conditions within the carpal tunnel and affect tendon-SSCT relative motion, which bridges an important gap between blood flow in the carpal tunnel and shear injury risk. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature, supporting the role that cumulative tendon-SSCT shear injury may have on the pathomechanics of carpal tunnel syndrome. © 201 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity  (sST2) and galectin-3 (gal-3) are biomarkers of myocardial remodeling and fibrosis; however, their potential association with post-operative changes is unknown. We measured peri-operative plasma sST2 and gal-3 levels in two prospective cohorts (TRIBE-AKI and NNE) of over 180 patients who underwent cardiac surgery. sST2 and gal-3 levels were evaluated for association with a composite primary outcome of cardiovascular event or mortality over median follow-up periods of 3.4 and 6.0 years, respectively, for the two cohorts. Meta-analysis of hazard ratio estimates from the cohorts was performed using random effects models. Cohorts demonstrated event rates of 70.2 and 66.8 per 100 person-years for the primary composite outcome. After adjustment for clinical covariates, higher post-operative sST2 and gal-3 levels were significantly associated with cardiovascular event or mortality [pooled estimate HRs: sST2 1.2 (95% CI 1.16, 1.44); gal-3 1.2 (95% CI 1.09, 1.46)].

Scheduling of such systems may be used to determine power generation and generating unit decisions that optimize economic performance subject to prevailing constraints. The highly volatile and unpredictable nature of market and weather conditions give rise to uncertainties in electricity prices and water inflows, which may significantly impact the power generation schedules for these systems. Computed schedules may also give rise to significant variation in the generating unit commitments in response to slight fluctuations in electricity pricing, a phenomenon referred to as “nervousness”.

To study this phenomenon, a single particle of aluminum titanate is dissolved in slag at 1773 K. During the dissolution process, gas bubble evolution is observed. Further, the particle–slag system is rapidly quenched using helium at different stages of dissolution. The quenched samples are examined for distribution of the constituent elements: Al, Ti, Ca, and Si using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Phases such as alumina, titanium-rich slag, and calcium titanate are detected at the particle–slag interface. The dissolution path of aluminum titanate is proposed in the following steps. First, aluminum titanate dissociates into alumina, titanium oxide, and oxygen while slag penetrates through the particle. In the next step, the alumina and titanium oxide dissolve in slag, and the oxygen leaves the system. The existence of gas bubbles enhances the overall rate of Al2TiO5 dissolution. The dissolution of Al2TiO5 appears to be controlled by mass transfer in the slag. Evidence in support of this finding is the particle–slag interface characterization by line scan analysis and calculated diffusivity values being inversely proportional to the viscosity of slag.",2020-04-01,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B-process Metallurgy and Materials Processing Science,https://openalex.org/V68503223,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11663-019-01762-2,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998085768,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11663-019-01762-2,journal-article,2998085768

The objectives of this paper are to simulate the mechanical properties of CFRP to fracture and design a tensile test rig that could induce fracture at the specimen gauge section consistently. Finite element solver ABAQUS Explicit was used to simulate the effects of mass/time scaling, different failure models and cohesive surfaces. Failure models evaluated were Hashin, MCT, LaRC02, maximum strain, Tsai-Wu, Tsai-Hill, Christensen and Puck. The fibre orientations investigated were parallel, 45 ° and perpendicular to the tensile loading condition. Extensive design of the tensile test rig was briefly described. Experimental results showed that with the newly designed test rig, the failure occurred in the gauge region, regardless of the fibre orientation. When the fibre orientation was parallel to the tensile load, all the failure models show similar rate of force increment with respect to displacement. Puck's failure model most accurately predicts the fracture force and displacement versus experimental data. With fibre orientations at 45 ° and 9 ° , the maximum strain and LaRCO2 failure models were more suitable in terms of accuracy and simulation convergence. Incorporating cohesive surfaces between instances to predict nonlinearity in the loading response is critical. Significant reduction in failure force was predicted when test was setup at angles between parallel to 45 ° . The model was capable of predicting the effects of fibre orientation and laminate thickness on fracture force agreeing with published experimental results.",2020-06-01,Materials today communications,https://openalex.org/V2765035490,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2019.100872,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998637165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2019.100872,journal-article,2998637165

A better understanding of mechanical factors associated with progression and whether they differ for structural versus clinical outcomes could lead to improved conservative management. This study examined baseline gait differences between progression and no progression groups defined at an average of 7-year follow-up using  different outcomes indicative of knee osteoarthritis progression: radiographic medial joint space narrowing and total knee arthroplasty. Of 4 individuals with knee osteoarthritis who underwent baseline gait analysis, 3 progressed and 1 did not progress using the radiographic outcome, while 1 progressed and 3 did not progress using the arthroplasty outcome. Key knee moment and electromyography waveform features were extracted using principal component analysis, and confidence intervals were used to examine between-group differences in these metrics. Those who progressed using the arthroplasty outcome had prolonged rectus femoris and lateral hamstrings muscle activation compared with the no arthroplasty group.

Nevertheless, some FMs may experience complicated grief (CG) reactions, with symptoms lasting months or years, and CG is particularly prominent among FMs of those who die in the intensive care unit (ICU). The purpose of this study was to examine how FMs experience grief, particularly CG, to inform future early screening and support programs in the ICU. This was a multicentre qualitative study focusing on semi-structured interviews with FMs who displayed symptoms of CG. Family members of patients who died in the ICU and who had a six-month inventory of CG score > 25 were included. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with FMs post-loss, with follow-up interviews three months after the initial interviews. Major themes identified following thematic analysis from eight participants with CG included 1) ante-mortem experience: the impact of the ICU experience prior to death of a loved on subsequent grief; 2) post-mortem experience: unpredictable post death reactions; 3) coping strategies: techniques used to reduce the severity of grief reactions; 4) sources of support: focusing on resources that the FM draws from for emotional support; and 5) perspectives on future ICU bereavement screening and support programs: advice that FM participants provided for future bereavement support.

The objectives were to characterise and compare the amino acid composition among different aquatic species, dietary habits, and environmental conditions. Benthic macroinvertebrates from different functional feeding groups (FFG), bulk zooplankton, biofilm, and fishes representing 1 families (21 genera or species) were collected from temperate lakes in eastern Canada during the summers of 201 and 2014. Fifteen protein-bound amino acids, including thiols, were measured in whole invertebrates, biofilm, or fish muscle. We hypothesised that the amino acid composition will differ among species and systems. Multiple discriminant analyses revealed significant differences in the amino acid composition among species—based on varying percentages of cysteine (as cysteic acid) and histidine—and among FFG/trophic designations—based on histidine and lysine—where the primary consumers were more variable than the predators. Overall, the results suggest that patterns were based on phylogenetics, biological characteristics, and the FFG/trophic designations of biota. The within-taxon variability in composition was also related to differences among lakes. Characteristics of their environment, including lake pH and the food web structure (abundance and composition of taxa), probably influenced their dietary habits and amino acid composition of diet.

Methods We use Yin’s (2014) embedded single-case study design, which allows for an in-depth exploration to qualitatively assess how, since the regulation of midwives in 1994, the Ontario health system has assigned roles to and integrated midwives as a service delivery option. Kingdon’s agenda setting and 3i + E theoretical frameworks are used to analyze two recent key policy directions (decision to fund freestanding midwifery-led birth centres and the Patients First primary care reform) that presented opportunities for the integration of midwives into the health system. Data were collected from key informant interviews and documents. Results Nineteen key informant interviews were conducted, and 50 documents were reviewed in addition to field notes taken during the interviews. Our findings suggest that while midwifery was created as a self-regulated profession in 1994, health-system transformation initiatives have restricted the profession’s integration into Ontario’s health system. The policy legacies of how past decisions influence the decisions possible today have the most explanatory power to understand why midwives have had limited integration into interprofessional maternity care. The most important policy legacies to emerge from the analyses were related to payment mechanisms. In the medical model, payment mechanisms privilege physician-provided and hospital-based services, while payment mechanisms in the midwifery model have imposed unintended restrictions on the profession’s ability to practice in interprofessional environments.

Despite being a critically important element in HIT etiology, relatively little is known about the specific molecular mechanism of PF4-heparin interactions. This work uses native mass spectrometry to investigate PF4 interactions with relatively short heparin chains (up to decasaccharides). The protein is shown to be remarkably unstable at physiological ionic strength in the absence of polyanions; only monomeric species are observed, and the extent of multiple charging of corresponding ions indicates a partial loss of conformational integrity. The tetramer signal remains at or below the detection threshold in the mass spectra until the solution's ionic strength is elevated well above the physiological level, highlighting the destabilizing role played by electrostatic interactions vis-a-vis quaternary structure of this high-pI protein. The tetramer assembly is dramatically facilitated by relatively short polyanions (synthetic heparin-mimetic pentasaccharide), with the majority of the protein molecules existing in the tetrameric state even at physiological ionic strength. Each tetramer accommodates up to six pentasaccharides, with at least three such ligands required to guarantee the higher-order structure integrity. Similar results are obtained for PF4 association with longer and structurally heterogeneous heparin oligomers (decamers). These longer polyanions can also induce PF4 dimer assembly when bound to the protein in relatively low numbers, lending support to a model of PF4/heparin interaction in which the latter wraps around the protein, making contacts with multiple subunits. Taken together, these results provide a more nuanced picture of PF4-glycosaminoglycan interactions leading to complex formation.

The effects of this legislation on suicide and homicide rates were examined over the years 1981 to 2016. Models were constructed using difference-in-difference analysis of firearms and non firearms death rates from 1981 to 2016. In addition, negative binomial regression was used to test for an association between rates of suicide by Canadian Province and firearms prevalence, using licensing rates as a proxy for prevalence. No associated benefit from firearms legislation on aggregate rates of male suicide was found. In men aged 4 to 5 an associated shift from firearms suicide after 199 and 199 to an increase in hanging resulted in overall rate ratios of 0.994 (95%CI, 0.978,1.010) and 0.99 (95%CI, 0.980,1.005) respectively.

However, none of them are capable of immobilizing a freely mobile animal such as C. elegans worm using a passive immobilization mechanism. Here, a microfluidic microinjector was developed to passively immobilize a freely mobile animal such as C. elegans and simultaneously perform microinjection by using a simple and fast mechanism for needle actuation. The entire process of the microinjection takes ~30 s which includes 1 s for worm loading and aligning, 5 s needle penetration, 5 s reagent injection and 5 s worm unloading. The device is suitable for high-throughput and can be potentially used for creating transgenic C. elegans.",2020-03-11,Micromachines,https://openalex.org/V96702057,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11030295,295,295,11,3,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W829305659,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11030295,journal-article,829305659

However, the process of ethical decision-making within the broader context of reasoning is yet to be clearly explicated.Objective: The purpose of this study was to advance a theoretical understanding of the process by which occupational therapists make ethical decisions in day-to-day practice.Method: A constructivist grounded theory approach was adopted, incorporating in-depth semi-structured interviews with 18 occupational therapists from a range of practice settings and years of experience. Initially, participants nominated as key informants who were able to reflect on their decision-making processes were recruited. Theoretical sampling informed subsequent stages of data collection. Participants were asked to describe their process of ethical decision-making using scenarios from clinical practice. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a systematic process of initial then focused coding, and theoretical categorization to construct a theory regarding the process of ethical decision-making.Findings: An ethical decision-making prism was developed to capture three main processes: Considering the Fundamental Checklist, Consulting Others, and Doing What's Right.

Here, we examined trajectories of shyness from childhood to adulthood in three groups ( N = 254), with varying degrees of prenatal adversity as indicated by the number of stressful exposures: extremely low birth weight (ELBW; &lt;1000 g) survivors prenatally exposed to exogenous corticosteroids (ELBW+S, n = 56); ELBW survivors not prenatally exposed to exogenous corticosteroids (ELBW+NS, n = 56); and normal birth weight (NBW, n = 142) controls. Multilevel modeling revealed that the ELBW+S individuals exhibited the highest levels of childhood shyness, which remained stable into adulthood. The ELBW+NS and NBW controls had comparably low levels of childhood shyness; however, the ELBW+NS individuals experienced patterns of increasing shyness, while NBW controls displayed decreases in shyness into adulthood. We speculate that individuals exposed to multiple prenatal stressors (i.e., ELBW+S) may be developmentally programmed to be more sensitive to detecting social threat, with one manifestation being early developing, stable shyness, while increasing shyness among ELBW+NS individuals may reflect a later developing shyness influenced by postnatal context.

Fluvial systems in southern Ontario are regularly affected by widespread early-spring flood events primarily caused by rain-on-snow events. Recent studies have shown an increase in winter floods in this region due to increasing winter temperature and precipitation. Streamflow simulations are associated with uncertainties mainly due to the different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, global climate models (GCMs) or the choice of the hydrological model. The internal variability of climate, defined as the chaotic variability of atmospheric circulation due to natural internal processes within the climate system, is also a source of uncertainties to consider. Uncertainties of internal variability can be assessed using hydrological models fed by downscaled data of a global climate model large ensemble (GCM-LE), but GCM outputs have too coarse of a scale to be used in hydrological modeling. The Canadian Regional Climate Model Large Ensemble (CRCM5-LE), a 50-member ensemble downscaled from the Canadian Earth System Model version  Large Ensemble (CanESM2-LE), was developed to simulate local climate variability over northeastern North America under different future climate scenarios. In this study, CRCM5-LE temperature and precipitation projections under an RCP8.5 scenario were used as input in the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to simulate streamflow at a near-future horizon (2026–2055) for four watersheds in southern Ontario. To investigate the role of the internal variability of climate in the modulation of streamflow, the 5 members were first grouped in classes of similar projected change in January–February streamflow and temperature and precipitation between 1961–1990 and 2026–2055. Then, the regional change in geopotential height (Z500) from CanESM2-LE was calculated for each class. Model simulations showed an average January–February increase in streamflow of 1 % (±8.7) in Big Creek, 30.5 % (±10.8) in Grand River, 29.8 % (±10.4) in Thames River and 31. % (±13.3) in Credit River. A total of 14 % of all ensemble members projected positive Z500 anomalies in North America's eastern coast enhancing rain, snowmelt and streamflow volume in January–February. For these members the increase of streamflow is expected to be as high as 31. % (±8.1) in Big Creek, 48.3 % (±11.1) in Grand River, 4 % (±9.6) in Thames River and 53.7 % (±15) in Credit River. Conversely, 14 % of the ensemble projected negative Z500 anomalies in North America's eastern coast and were associated with a much lower increase in streamflow: 8.3 % (±7.8) in Big Creek, 18. % (±5.8) in Grand River, 17.8 % (±6.4) in Thames River and 18. % (±6.5) in Credit River. These results provide important information to researchers, managers, policymakers and society about the expected ranges of increase in winter streamflow in a highly populated region of Canada, and they will help to explain how the internal variability of climate is expected to modulate the future streamflow in this region.",2020-06-12,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,https://openalex.org/V93121129,,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3077-2020,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2946165402,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3077-2020,journal-article,2946165402

This study reviews and reports our single-center experience with hybrid aortic arch repair over the span of a decade.A total of 4 patients who underwent hybrid arch repair from 200 to 201 were identified. Key endpoints included the presenting pathology, perioperative details, and postoperative outcomes.The mean age was 64.9 years at the commencement of surgery (61.4% men [n = 27] and 38.6% women [n = 16]). Presenting pathologies included aneurysms (77%), dissections (16%), pseudoaneurysms (5%), and transections (2%). While most procedures were multistaged, single-stage interventions were completed for 16.3% (n = 7) of patients. Emergent surgeries were performed in 23.3% of cases; the remaining 76.7% of cases were elective. The proximal extents of endovascular repair were zone  (n = 4), zone  (n = 12), zone  (n = 20), and zone  (n = 1). The remaining  patients had had aberrant or anomalous distal origins of a great vessel that required debranching. Technical success rates of surgical revascularizations and subsequent endovascular stenting were both 100%. The 30-day perioperative event rates for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events were 7.0% (n = 3), 4.7% (n = 2), and 9.3% (n = 4), respectively. At the end of 2-year follow-up, total mortality and stroke rates were 11.6% (n = 5) and 7.0% (n = 3), respectively. The 2-year primary patency of the revascularizations was 97.8%, and the associated primary-assisted patency was 100%. Secondary interventions were necessary for 32% (n = 12) of the patients, 67% of which (n = 8) were warranted because of endoleaks. The remaining secondary interventions were required to resolve device migration (n = 1), stent graft stenosis (n = 1), and disease progression (n = 2).Hybrid approaches are viable alternatives to entirely open surgical treatments of acute and chronic aortic arch pathology and may be particularly attractive for high-risk patients.

Most methods focus on aspects of the process of diagnostic reasoning, such as the relation between case features and diagnostic hypotheses. Inevitably, detailed elucidation of aspects of the process requires substantial time per case and limits the number of cases that can be examined given a limited testing time. Shifting assessment to the outcome of diagnostic reasoning, accuracy of the diagnosis, may serve as a reliable measure of diagnostic competence and would allow increased sampling across cases. The present study is a retrospective analysis of  large studies, conducted by  research teams, that all used a series of brief written cases to examine the outcome of diagnostic reasoning—the diagnosis. The studies involved over 60 clinicians ranging from final year medical students to practicing emergency physicians. For  studies with usable reliability data, reliability for a 2 h test ranged from .6 to .94. On average speeded tests were more reliable (.85 vs. .73).To achieve a reliability of .7 required an average test time of 1.11 h for speeded tests and 1.99 for unspeeded tests.

The primary end point was the proportion of patients who met at least one criterion.Between January 201 and May 2017, 838 patients were entered in the database; 29 had inadequate risk data; 282 (35%) met at least one criterion for genetic testing (at-risk population). Most (83%) met just one criterion. The criterion of non-clear cell histology contributed the largest proportion of at-risk patients (59%), followed by age ≤ 4 years (28%).

Twenty patients (35%) of the patients at risk and tested for hereditary RCC were found to harbour a germline mutation.Application of the Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria to a large prospective database resulted in 35% of patients being identified at risk for hereditary RCC who could qualify for genetic testing. However, the true incidence of hereditary RCC in this population is unknown as most patients did not have documented genetic testing carried out and, thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria cannot be determined.

This offers opportunities to reduce a DC’s energy budget by considering alternatives to traditional cooling methods, such as perimeter or in-row air-conditioners, which suffer from inherent airflow deficiencies, e.g., hot air recirculation and cold air bypass. Due to these deficiencies, not enough cold air is supplied to the ITE, leading to hot spots that reduce equipment life significantly. Rack mountable cooling units (RMCUs), i.e., air-handlers mounted within the same enclosure containing the ITE, do not face this problem due to their proximity to servers. However, a proper understanding of airflow and temperature distribution inside an enclosure containing an RMCU has not yet been developed, preventing its widespread adoption. We investigate the temperature and airflow for various ITE configurations to determine the efficacy of an RMCU inside an enclosed rack. Experiments reveal that the principal factor influencing the temperature distribution is the leakage of warm air through passive servers, a hitherto unreported facet, which is dependent on the locations of these servers, IT load density and distribution, and cold chamber depth. This is also illustrated through a neural network model. The results help us to devise a design strategy to optimize ITE configurations with desirable temperature distributions, and to inform server workload assignments.",2020-06-01,Thermal science and engineering progress,https://openalex.org/V4210220034,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2019.100395,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968209916,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2019.100395,journal-article,2968209916

The extent of that energy reduction depends on the nature of the tasks, and on the choice of the multiple access scheme. In this paper, we first address the uplink communication resource allocation for offloading systems that exploit the full capabilities of the multiple access channel (FullMA). For indivisible tasks we provide a closed-form optimal solution of the energy minimization problem when a given set of users with different latency constraints are offloading, and a tailored greedy search algorithm for finding a good set of offloading users. For divisible tasks we develop a low-complexity algorithm to find a stationary solution. To highlight the impact of the choice of multiple access scheme, we also consider the TDMA scheme, which, in general, cannot exploit the full capabilities of the channel, and we develop low-complexity optimal resource allocation algorithms for indivisible and divisible tasks under that scheme. The energy reduction facilitated by FullMA is illustrated in our numerical experiments. Further, those results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms in terms of energy consumption and computational cost.",2020-03-01,Signal Processing,https://openalex.org/V154637859,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.107322,107322,107322,168,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2974970557,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.107322,journal-article,2974970557

The proposed electrothermal model calculates power loss and junction temperature by representing the three-phase dc–dc converter dynamics within a drive cycle using a three-phase state-space average model. The three-phase state-space average model is modified to represent converter dynamics when one or two phases are off , in addition to the phase transition dynamics. The existing electrothermal models can either represent converter dynamics but are too slow for long simulations like drive cycles, or they reduce the simulation time at the expense of junction temperature accuracy. Furthermore, the existing electrothermal models in the literature are for inverters and single-phase dc–dc converters.

'Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience, Strengthening Quality through Health Connectors for Diabetes Management' (Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM) integrates volunteer 'health connectors' into a community- and primary care-based program supporting client self-management in Hamilton, Canada. Volunteers supported clients through goal setting, motivation, education and connections to community resources and primary care. This study aimed to create and apply a volunteer program evaluation framework to explore: (a) volunteer training effectiveness (learning online content, in-person training, self-efficacy in role tasks, training overall); (b) feasibility of program implementation (process measures, reflections on client encounters, understanding of volunteer roles/responsibilities, client perspectives on volunteer program); and (c) effects of volunteering on volunteers (health outcomes, self-efficacy, value of volunteering). A concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods design was used. Data were collected in 2016, sources included: volunteer online training quizzes, focus groups, self-efficacy survey, Veterans RAND 12-Item (VR-12) survey, in-person training feedback forms and narratives of client visits; client interviews; and quantitative implementation data. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, paired samples t tests, and effect size (Cohen's d). Qualitative data used descriptive thematic analysis. Nineteen volunteers and 12 clients participated in this evaluation. Findings demonstrate the volunteer program evaluation framework in action. Online training increased knowledge. In-person training received largely positive evaluations. Self-efficacy was high post-training and higher after volunteering. VR-12 sub-scale means increased descriptively. Volunteers understood themselves as healthcare system connectors, feeling fulfilled with their contributions and learning new skills.

Specimens were deformed at room-temperature and subjected to interrupted annealing at 700 °C for different time. Microhardness was performed for each as-deformed/annealed condition, including the initial as-received material. The dislocation structures, as well as, the spatial and size distribution of precipitates have been studied by transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that the nucleation of precipitates is inhomogeneous due to heterogeneities within the as-deformed microstructure. The main feature is the formation of microbands (about 0.1 μm–0.5 μm in thickness) and dislocation tangles/cell structures. The formation of precipitates was observed only after the first pass during the multi-pass deformation and annealing process.

These properties include coating hardness and elastic modulus, adhesion to substrate, roughness, defects, and most importantly residual stress. In general, the properties of a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating can be controlled by adjusting deposition parameters such as substrate bias voltage and nitrogen pressure. Therefore, a coating can be tailored to withstand a specific wear mode which is dominant in machining the workpiece material. In this work a strategy is suggested to decrease adhesion wear and formation of built-up edge during machining of compacted graphite iron (CGI). This strategy involves deposition of thick TiAlN coating with low residual stress in order to promote cohesive failure within the coating. For this purpose, monolayer Ti40Al60N PVD coatings with high thickness (5–10 μm) were deposited under various deposition parameters. A comprehensive coating characterization was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindentation, and scratch test. Tool life of selected coatings were then tested under dry finishing of compacted graphite iron, and wear pattern was investigated with optical and scanning electron microscope. The results showed that coating under low compressive residual stress is successful in reducing sticking and built-up edge formation. This phenomenon happens with gradual cohesive failure of the coating under adhesion wear, resulting in a higher tool life under adhesive wear.",2020-02-01,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,https://openalex.org/V77056576,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-019-04854-0,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997935476,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-019-04854-0,journal-article,2997935476

While rigorous evaluations of AMR interventions are the ideal, they are far from the current reality. Additionally, poor reporting and documentation of AMR interventions impede efforts to use evidence to inform future evaluations and policy interventions. Objectives To critically evaluate reporting quality gaps in AMR intervention research. Methods To evaluate the reporting quality of studies, we conducted a descriptive synthesis and comparative analysis of studies that were included in a recent systematic review of government policy interventions aiming to reduce human antimicrobial use. Reporting quality was assessed using the SQUIRE 2.0 checklist of 18 items for reporting system-level interventions to improve healthcare. Two reviewers independently applied the checklist to 6 studies identified in the systematic review. Results None of the studies included complete information on all 18 SQUIRE items (median score = 10, IQR = 8–11). Reporting quality varied across SQUIRE items, with 3% to 100% of studies reporting the recommended information for each SQUIRE item. Only 20% of studies reported the elements of the intervention in sufficient detail for replication and only 24% reported the mechanism through which the intervention was expected to work.

However, little is known about whether VSAs influence stream communities and whether this connectivity is affected by forest management. To address this, we used multiple biotic and abiotic indicators to (1) examine the influence of VSAs on riparian vegetation and stream ecosystems by comparing VSA and non-VSA reaches and (2) explore how forest management may affect the influence of VSAs on stream ecosystems. We detected some significant differences between VSA and non-VSA reaches in the riparian vegetation (greater understory and lower tree density) and stream ecosystem indicators (greater dissolved organic matter aromaticity, microbial biomass, peroxidase activity and collector-gatherer density, and lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations, algal biomass, and predatory macroinvertebrate density), which suggests that VSAs may create a more heterotrophic ecosystem locally. However, we show some evidence that forest management activities (specifically, road density) can alter the influence of VSAs and eliminate the differences observed at lower forest management intensities, and that the most hydrologically connected areas seem more sensitive to disturbance. Therefore, we suggest that the heterogeneity in hydrological connectivity along riparian zones should be considered when planning forest harvesting operations and road building (e.g., wider riparian buffers around VSAs).",2020-06-01,Ecological Applications,https://openalex.org/V166870025,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2077,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001850708,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2077,journal-article,3001850708

Their prediction and management has largely focused on a subset of SOI compounds referred to as thiosalts (SnOx2−), with thiosulfate (S2O32−) presumed to be the dominant thiosalt species, yet no published study to date has determined if SnOx2−and, specifically S2O32−, dominate SOIs in these waters. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine sulfur mass balance across a range of mining impacted waters; (2) evaluate whether SnOx2−compounds dominate the SOI pool for these waters; and (3) compare current industry analytical methods for thiosalts determination with a new approach proposed here. From 201 to 2018, 5 water samples were collected from four Canadian base metal mine water management systems in Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland. These samples were characterized for total sulfur (TotS) as well as individual sulfur species (∑H2S, S0, SO32−, S2O32−, S3O62−, S4O62−, and SO42−). Thiosulfate was consistently found to represent only a minor component of TotS, with an average relative percentage of ≈ 4% across all samples. The reactive sulfur pool, (Sreact), defined here as all sulfur compounds capable of oxidation, was significant and variable, averaging 30 ± 25% of the S budget. A direct comparison of Sreact concentrations to thiosalts concentrations determined by either of the two currently available analytical methods (indirect acid titration method or direct S2O32− method by ion chromatography) indicated that Sreact was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for a selected suite of samples (n = 6) collected in 2018. These results indicate that currently available methods may underreport the concentrations of oxidizable sulfur compounds in tailings reservoir water caps and receiving environmental waters.

Data from eight observational studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and random-effects meta-analysis was subsequently conducted. Results Eight observational studies (all eight reporting on healthy dietary patterns and three on unhealthy dietary patterns) met the inclusion criteria and data were extracted to include in the meta-analysis. Consumption of a healthy dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk of COPD (pooled OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94). Consumption of unhealthy dietary patterns was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84–1.76); however, the results were not statistically significant and had high heterogeneity (I  =91%). Conclusion Our results suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a lower prevalence of COPD, while unhealthy dietary patterns are not. More studies, particularly adequately powered longitudinal studies, are needed to further elucidate the effects of healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns on risk of COPD.",2020-04-01,ERJ Open Research,https://openalex.org/V2738738902,European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00168-2019,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023362865,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00168-2019,journal-article,3023362865

Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) is a multi-component intervention involving trained community volunteers functioning as extensions of primary care teams, supporting care based on older adults’ health goals and needs. This study aimed to gain an understanding of volunteer experiences within the program and client and health care provider perspectives on the volunteer role. Methods This study used a qualitative descriptive approach embedded in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Participants included Health TAPESTRY volunteers, health care providers, volunteer coordinator, and program clients, all connected to two primary care practice sites in a large urban setting in Ontario, Canada. Data collection included semi-structured focus groups and interviews with all participants, and the completion of a measure of attitudes toward older adults and self-efficacy for volunteers. Qualitative data were inductively coded and analyzed using a constant comparative approach. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results Overall, 3 volunteers and 6 other participants (clients, providers, volunteer coordinator) were included. Themes included: 1. Volunteer training: “An investment in volunteers”; 2. Intergenerational volunteer pairing: “The best of both worlds”; 3. Understanding the volunteer role and its scope: “Lay people involved in care”; 4. Volunteers as extensions of primary care teams: “Being the eyes where they live”; 5. The disconnect between volunteers and the clinical team: “Is something being done?”; 6. “Learning… all the time”: Impacts on volunteers; and 7. Clients’ acceptance of volunteers. Conclusions This study showed that it is possible to integrate community volunteers into the primary care setting, adding human connections to deepen the primary care team’s understanding of their patients. Program implementation suggestions that emerged included: using role play in training, making volunteer role boundaries and specifications clear, and making efforts to connect volunteers and the primary care team they are supporting. This exploration of stakeholder voices has the potential to help improve volunteer program uptake and acceptability, as well as volunteer recruitment, retention, and training.

Based on weekday travel in the Halifax Regional Municipality, we develop four separate models of tour complexity, each corresponding to a specific type of tour. The average number of trips per tour is regressed against built environment characteristics while household, personal, and tour-specific characteristics and residential self-selection are controlled. We apply ordinary least squares regression and spatial lag models and use a comprehensive set of density, diversity, design, and accessibility metrics near home and workplace. The results indicate that higher accessibility and mixed land-use is associated with simpler home-based, non-work tours. Workers residing away from opportunities make complex tours near workplaces located in high accessibility areas. Auto users make more complex tours. Also, most workers make complex commute tours compared to home-based or work-based non-work tours. In general, individuals compensate for the poor accessibility of residential locations by making complex tours, relying on auto, and chaining non-work trips with commuting. The significant role of attitudinal variables is also observed, thus revealing the presence of residential self-selection in trip-chaining behavior.",2020-04-01,Transportation,https://openalex.org/V62009534,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-018-9914-3,737,761,47,2,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2886459483,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-018-9914-3,journal-article,2886459483

Male respondents aged 15-49 were selected. Ordinal regression was used to analyze the relationship between three sexual risk behaviors-condom use with non-cohabiting partners, number of non-cohabiting partners, and partner type-and circumcision status (traditionally circumcised before and after the VMMC scale-up, medically circumcised before and after the scale-up, and not circumcised), while controlling for social demographic covariates. We found evidence that some sexual risky behavior, specifically lower condom use and higher number of sexual partners, was associated with traditional circumcision. This finding suggests that messages about the protective effect of male circumcision may not have reached men with traditional circumcision. We suggest that WHO's VMMC campaign should include communities where traditional male circumcision is popular.

It is unclear whether this applies to bariatric surgery. This study aims to determine whether there is a surrogate volume effect of common laparoscopic general surgery procedures on all-cause bariatric surgical morbidity. This was a population-based study of all patients aged ≥ 18 who received a bariatric procedure in Ontario from 200 to 2015. The main outcome of interest was all-cause morbidity during the index admission. All-cause morbidity included any documented complication which extended length of stay by 24 h or required reoperation. Bariatric cases included laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Non-bariatric cases included three common laparoscopic general surgery procedures. 13,836 bariatric procedures were performed by 2 surgeons at nine centers of excellence. A reduction in all-cause morbidity was seen when bariatric surgeons exceeded 7 cases annually (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98, P = 0.023), with further reduction in increasing bariatric volume. However, the volume of non-bariatric surgeries did not significantly affect bariatric all-cause morbidity rates amongst bariatric surgeons, even when exceeding 10 cases (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61–1.12, P = 0.222). The present study suggests that experience and skills acquired in performing non-bariatric laparoscopic general surgery does not appear to affect all-cause morbidity in bariatric surgery. Therefore, only a surgeon’s bariatric procedure volume should considered be a quality marker for outcomes after bariatric surgery.",2020-03-01,Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques,https://openalex.org/V47192491,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06897-6,1278,1284,34,3,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2953311571,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06897-6,journal-article,2953311571

Therefore, the correct physio-chemical modeling of the contact regions in OTFTs is necessary. In this work, a versatile model for the contact region of OTFTs is proposed, since it describes the current-voltage characteristics of different kinds of contacts. It reproduces the behavior of Schottky barrier or space-charge limited contacts. It is a simple unified model since only a single parameter is necessary in order to distinguish between both kinds of contacts. The model is easily integrated in a generic compact model for the current-voltage characteristics of OTFTs. The resulting compact model, used in combination with an evolutionary parameter extraction procedure, allows to extract the intrinsic parameters and the current-voltage curves at the contact of single short-channel transistors. There is no need to use transistors with multiple channel lengths to accurately characterize the contact region or the active channel of the transistor. The model is tested with published experimental data of OTFTs with Schottky barrier or space-charge limited contacts. Finally, the method has been used as a diagnostic tool to analyze how an ammonia sensor reacts to different concentrations of the ammonia gas. Interestingly, alterations in the contact region have been detected when the gas concentration varies, transforming the space-charge limited contact of a pristine OTFT into a Schottky barrier contact under the exposure of gas.",2020-02-01,Organic Electronics,https://openalex.org/V99846442,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105523,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982548103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105523,journal-article,2982548103

A useful model for understanding collective, consensus-driven decision-making is the fluid nest selection dynamics of ant colonies. Certain ant species oscillate between occupying multiple nests simultaneously (polydomy) and reuniting at a single location (monodomy), but little is known about how colonies achieve a consensus around these dynamics. To investigate the factors underpinning the splitting-reunification dynamics of ants, we manipulated the availability and quality of nest sites for the ant Temnothorax rugatulus and measured the likelihood and speed of reunification from contrasting starting conditions. We found that pursuing reunification was more likely for smaller colonies, that rates of initial splitting were lower when colonies could coordinate their activity from a central hub, and that diluting colonies among additional sites did not impair reaching consensus on a single nest. We further found mixed support for a specific threshold of social density that prevents reunification (i.e., prolonged polydomy) and no evidence that nest quality influences reunification behavior. Together our data reveal that consensus driven decisions can be influenced by both external and intrinsic group-level factors and are in no way simple stereotyped processes.",2020-01-01,Behavioural Processes,https://openalex.org/V128158437,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.103994,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982847882,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.103994,journal-article,2982847882

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from two blinded cluster randomized control trials of influenza vaccines in Hutterite colonies. In trial 1, children received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or hepatitis A vaccine. In trial 2, children received trivalent live attenuated (TLAIV) or TIV. We assessed four outcomes (total number of symptoms, number of respiratory symptoms, number of systemic symptoms, and duration of symptoms) among children with PCR-confirmed influenza. We utilized two-sample t tests to quantify the relationship between vaccine group and outcome. We performed multivariable strain-specific analyses, controlling for age and season. RESULTS TIV vs. Hep A vaccine: Among vaccinated children, 20 confirmed influenza infections were observed across 301 person-seasons. Vaccine type (TIV vs. Hep A vaccine) did not significantly affect the number of respiratory or systemic symptoms, nor duration of symptoms (P > .05). TLAIV vs. TIV: Among 118 children who received a study vaccine, 16 confirmed influenza infections were observed. TLAIV recipients experienced fewer total, respiratory, and systemic symptoms compared to TIV recipients (P < .05 for all). TLAIV-associated attenuation of symptom severity was observed in influenza B or A/H1N1 infections, but not H3.

Efficient phosphate (Pi) use by plants would increase crop productivity under Pi-limiting conditions and reduce our reliance on Pi applied as fertilizer. An ecotype of Eutrema salsugineum originating from the Yukon, Canada, shows no evidence of decreased relative growth rate or biomass under low Pi conditions and, as such, offers a promising model for identifying mechanisms to improve Pi use by crops. We evaluated traits associated with efficient Pi use by Eutrema (Yukon ecotype) seedlings and 4-week-old plants, including acquisition, remobilization, and the operation of metabolic bypasses. Relative to Arabidopsis, Eutrema was slower to remobilize phosphorus (P) from senescing leaves, primary and lateral roots showed a lower capacity for rhizosphere acidification, and root acid phosphatase activity was more broadly distributed and not Pi responsive. Both species produced long root hairs on low Pi media, whereas Arabidopsis root hairs were well endowed with phosphatase activity. This capacity was largely absent in Eutrema. In contrast to Arabidopsis, maximal in vitro rates of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities were not responsive to low Pi conditions suggesting that Eutrema has a constitutive and likely preferential capacity to use glycolytic bypass enzymes. Rhizosphere acidification, exudation of acid phosphatases, and rapid remobilization of leaf P are unlikely strategies used by Eutrema for coping with low Pi. Rather, equipping an entire root system for Pi acquisition and utilizing a metabolic strategy suited to deficient Pi conditions offer better explanations for how Eutrema has adapted to thrive on alkaline, highly saline soil that is naturally low in available Pi.",2020-01-01,Planta,https://openalex.org/V193523036,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03314-z,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990100928,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-019-03314-z,journal-article,2990100928

As part of this response, depressive symptoms promote analytical rumination, a prolonged and distraction-resistant style of thinking that functions to address the triggering problem. Analytical rumination involves analytical thinking about why the problem happened (i.e., causal analysis) and how it can be solved or alleviated (i.e., problem-solving analysis). Previous research analyzing cross-sectional data suggests that causal analysis is directly related to depressive symptoms and precedes problem-solving analysis, but this finding should be supported with experimental methods. We used an expressive writing paradigm to investigate the temporal order of the emotional symptoms of depression, causal analysis, and problem-solving analysis in a non-clinical sample. In two studies, we randomized participants to write about their personal problems or a neutral topic (i.e., control writing). All participants reported on their emotions during writing, and they retrospectively reported on their thoughts after writing. Consistent with our predictions, expressive writing reliably increased self-reported sadness and causal analysis but not problem-solving analysis. Linguistic analyses partially supported our predictions. Relative to control writing, expressive writing contained more words related to causal thoughts and problem-solving. Since causal analysis and sadness increased over the short time frame of the writing intervention, while problem-solving analysis was unaffected, the results support our prediction that causal analysis precedes problem-solving analysis.

This exposure increases the risk of children suffering both short-term and long-term impacts, including effects on their behaviour, social development, physical and mental health, educational attainment and quality of life. In addition, children living in environments where there is DV are at higher risk of maltreatment. Adult relatives and friends of the family often observe the experiences of children in situations of DV, and have the potential to shed light in a way that children and survivors may struggle to articulate, or be reluctant to acknowledge or disclose. Such accounts are largely absent from existing research, and yet bring a perspective which can broaden our understanding of the impact that DV has on children. This paper reports a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected during 21 in-depth interviews with people across the United Kingdom who were a friend or family member of a woman experiencing DV. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken and the themes generated were as follows: 'the context of DV: a chaotic and unpredictable home life'; 'the roles children assume within households where there is DV including: witness of, victim of and conduit of violence and abuse',; 'the impacts of DV on children'; and 'children's coping and resilience'.

We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 parents whose children were at risk of developmental delay to examine their perceptions of their child's development, their use of community services promoting development, and their recommendations to optimize those services. Results Four themes were identified: (a) Vision of child development influencing help-seeking behaviours: Natural or Supported?, (b) Internal and external sources contributing to parents' level of developmental concern, (c) Using internal resources and struggling to access external resources, and (d) Satisfaction with services accessed and recommendations to access more support. Parents' vision of child development along with sources of parental concern appeared to influence the level of concern, enhancing our understanding of how parents become concerned. The level of concern and parents' knowledge and perceived access to resources seemed to influence their decision whether or not to consult health care professionals. Parents provided many suggestions to improve services to promote child development and support families. Discussion Results highlight the importance of supporting parents in recognizing if their child is at risk of delay and increasing awareness of available resources. It appears particularly important to ensure that health care professionals and community-based support services are accessible to provide parents with the support they need, especially when they have concerns.",2020-01-01,Child Care Health and Development,https://openalex.org/V140531128,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12731,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2993014902,https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12731,journal-article,2993014902

Treatment approaches vary widely across clinics and may not reflect evidence-based care. Integrated care pathways (ICPs) are implementation tools to facilitate bridging the gap between rigorous but often complex clinical practice guidelines and what is actually practiced. We describe the development of an ICP for the treatment of Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD-A) based on the best-available clinical practice guidelines and derived in collaboration with clinicians, administrators, youth partners and caregivers. METHODS With clinician and health service manager input, we took the recommendations from a high quality clinical practice guideline (the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Clinical Practice Guideline for Depression in Children and Young People) and translated them into an ICP. Feedback from youth partners and clinicians was iteratively incorporated into the current version of the pathway using a collaborative approach. RESULTS The current iteration of the pathway at a Canadian tertiary care teaching hospital is described. All youth (and caregivers, if applicable) are offered a multi-family psychoeducation session, a 16-session Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and team reviews every 4 weeks that include measurement-based care. Conditional branches of the pathway include a medication algorithm and an 8-session group for caregivers.

Optimizing medication self-management is important for persons with SCI/D to improve outcomes; however, there is a lack of research on how healthcare/service providers and persons with SCI/D experience medication self-management. Objective To explore attitudes and experiences of medication self-management from the perspectives of persons with SCI/D and providers, and to explore the extent to which the Taxonomy of Everyday Self-management Strategies (TEDSS) framework captured participants’ experiences with medication self-management. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone until data saturation was reached. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative approaches. The TEDSS framework was adapted and applied deductively. Results Fifty-one individuals participated in this study, 3 providers and 1 persons with SCI/D. Disease controlling strategies was the domain discussed in most detail by all participants. In this domain, participants discussed managing medications and treatments, monitoring/managing side effects, and controlling complications. Process strategies (problem-solving, decision-making) and resource strategies (seeking support) were the next most frequently discussed domains. Among all participant groups, there was a lack of detailed discussion of social interactions, health behaviour, and internal strategies. Medication self-management support was not extensively discussed by any group. Conclusion This study highlighted the complex nature of medication self-management. While persons with SCI/D and providers discussed similar components of the TEDSS framework, providers had minimal reflections on the impact of medication self-management on everyday life. This study identified the need for explicit discussions between providers and persons with SCI/D, involving all components of self-management and self-management support in order to improve medication self-management.",2020-12-01,Research in Social & Administrative Pharmacy,https://openalex.org/V50431791,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.01.014,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004182665,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.01.014,journal-article,3004182665

Chronic disease management (CDM) can be a challenge, as the context of care provision and the way care is provided impact care delivery. This scoping review aimed to identify types of chronic diseases studied in intervention studies in NHs, influential contextual factors addressed by interventions and future CDM research considerations. Design The scoping review followed guidelines by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien (2010). Six reviewers screened citations for inclusion. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Data sources We searched four databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed and Scopus, in March 2018. Eligibility criteria Studies were included if (1) aim of intervention was to improve CDM, (2) intervention incorporated the chronic care model (CCM), (3) included NH residents, (4) analysed the efficacy of the intervention and (5) sample included adults over age 6 years. Studies were limited to English or French language and to those published after 1996, when the CCM was first conceptualised. Data extraction and synthesis Extracted information included the type of chronic disease, the type and number of CCM model components used in the intervention, the method of delivery of the intervention, and outcomes. Results On completion of the review of 1 91 citations, 1 studies were included. Most interventions targeted residents living with dementia. There was significant heterogeneity noted among designs, outcomes, and type and complexity of intervention components. There was little evaluation of the sustainability of interventions, including feasibility. Conclusions Research was heavily focused on management of dementia. The most commonly included CCM components were multidisciplinary care, evidence-based care, coordinated care and clinical information systems.

The role of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a participant in related signaling in other contexts, remains unknown in allergy. We detect novel activation of TAK1 at Ser412 in response to IgE-mediated activation under SCF-c-kit potentiation in a mast cell-driven response characteristic of allergic inflammation, which is potently blocked by TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (OZ). We, therefore, interrogated the role of TAK1 in a series of mast cell-mediated responses using IgE-sensitized murine bone marrow-derived mast cells, stimulated with allergen under several TAK1 inhibition strategies. TAK1 inhibition by OZ resulted in significant impairment in the phosphorylation of MAPKs p38, ERK, and JNK; and mediation of the NF-κB pathway via IκBα. Impaired gene expression and near abrogation in release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, IL-13, and chemokines CCL1, and CCL2 was detected. Finally, a significant inhibition of mast cell degranulation, accompanied by an impairment in calcium mobilization, was observed in TAK1-inhibited cells. These results suggest that TAK1 acts as a signaling node, not only linking the MAPK and NF-κB pathways in driving the late-phase response, but also initiation of the degranulation mechanism of the mast cell early-phase response following allergen recognition and may warrant consideration in future therapeutic development.",2020-04-01,Journal of Leukocyte Biology,https://openalex.org/V199011235,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.2a0220-401rrr,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008351465,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.2a0220-401rrr,journal-article,3008351465

They can develop post-concussion syndrome (PCS), which includes sleep abnormalities such as obstructive sleep apnea. It is unclear how specific sleep problems manifest in PCS and how it relates to cognition and symptomology. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on PCS patients seen at the University Health Network (UHN) Concussion Clinic and sent for sleep study. Neuropsychology tests, concussion features, PCS symptoms, and demographics were abstracted from clinical charts. Sleep measures were abstracted from the overnight sleep study. Data were analyzed using chi-squared tests and linear regression. Results: Fifty-one patients completed the sleep study; 78% of these were diagnosed with sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea reported significantly more memory symptoms. A trend existed for higher total symptom number. Age was significantly different between the two groups. Women and men were equally at risk of being diagnosed with sleep apnea. Conclusions: Sleep apnea is common in PCS patients complaining of non-restorative sleep and/or waking up with headaches.

We performed a multicenter feasibility study to examine our ability to identify and obtain consent from eligible APS patients and to obtain 95% adherence with daily rivaroxaban administration, in order to inform and power a larger study. Clinical outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis were also collected. Methods APS patients with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) were recruited over 2 years (Oct 2014–Sept 2016) and followed for ≥  year. Patients were assessed clinically every  months and had pill counts performed every  months. Numbers of patients fulfilling study criteria, as well as those consenting to participate, were tracked, and percentage adherence based on pill counts was recorded. These data were compared against the feasibility endpoints. Rates of thrombosis and bleeding were calculated. Criterion for feasibility was obtaining consent from 13 of 15 identified APS patients over 2 years. Results Ninety-six eligible patients were identified, and 1 declined participation. Eighty-two patients were followed for a mean of  months, representing 129.8 patient-years. Average rivaroxaban adherence was 95.0%. During follow-up, there were  thromboembolic events (2 cerebrovascular and 2 VTE). There were no episodes of major bleeding. Conclusions Adequately powered comparative trials using patient-important outcomes in APS are unlikely to be successful due to inability to recruit sufficient numbers of study subjects. This study does not reveal a higher than expected risk of recurrent thromboembolic disease compared to historical cohorts; however, this is an uncontrolled study in relatively low-risk APS patients.

In this investigation, π-CFRP anchors are used in an attempt to delay the onset of premature debonding and to achieve higher strength in beams retrofitted with a 1.2 mm thick and 50 mm wide CFRP laminate. This investigation consisted of testing six large scale T-beams with a 4500 mm span, 400 mm height and 500 mm flange width under four-point bending. Two beams were tested without retrofit as control beams, one beam with the laminate epoxy bonded to the beam and the remaining three beams with the laminate epoxy bonded and anchored using CFRP π-anchors. One of the beams with 30 anchors exhibited a 46% increase in the debonding load over the beam without anchors while the laminate attained a maximum strain equal to 80% of its ultimate strain capacity, a 94% increase compared to the maximum strain reached in the companion beam strengthened with only the epoxy bonded laminate. The displacement ductility ratio of the latter beam at debonding exceeded 4.

Nevertheless, the functional connectivity of neural circuitry associated with delay discounting and the ways in which the social environment may influence frontostriatal connectivity remain largely unknown, particularly in African Americans. Building on recent literature implicating frontostriatal connectivity during active delay discounting decision making and at rest, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the association between delay discounting and frontostriatal resting state connectivity (rsFC). We also examined the capacity of social relationships with parents and peers to longitudinally predict frontostriatal rsFC. The study cohort was composed of 9 rural African American emerging adults followed over a 6-year period. Greater (i.e., more positive) frontostriatal rsFC was associated with decreased delay discounting (i.e., less impulsive decision making). In addition, peer relationships at ages 2 and 2 significantly predicted frontostriatal rsFC at age 2 above and beyond parental influence. A significant indirect effect of peer affiliation on delay discounting through frontostriatal rsFC also emerged.

DNA methylation (DNAm) might enable foetal adaptations to environmental adversities through important gene loci. NEGR1 is involved in both energy balance and behaviour regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between placental DNAm at the NEGR1 gene locus and childhood anthropometric and neurodevelopmental profiles in preschoolers. We analysed 27 mother-child dyads from Gen3G, a prospective birth cohort from Sherbrooke. At 3yo (40.4 ± 3.0 months), we measured body mass index (BMI) and the mothers reported on offspring neurobehavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). We quantified DNAm levels at 3 CpGs at the NEGR1 locus using the MethylationEPIC Array in placental biopsies. DNAm at four CpGs located before NEGR1 second exon predicted child's BMI z-score (cg26153364: β=-0.1 ± 0.04; p=0.008, cg23166710: β=0.1 ± 0.08; p=0.03) and SDQ total score (cg04932878: β=0.2 ± 1.0; p= 3.0x10-4, cg16525738: β=-0.1 ± 0.18; p=0.01, cg23166710: β=-0.1 ± 0.36; p= 0.04), explaining 4.2% (p=0.003) and 7.3% (p= 1.3 x 10-4) of BMI-z and SDQ variances. cg23166710 was associated with both childhood phenotypes and correlated with NEGR1 placental expression (r=-0.22, p=0.04), suggesting its possible functional role. Together, maternal metabolic characteristics during pregnancy with NEGR1 DNAm levels explained 7.4% (p=4.2 x 10-4) of BMI-z and 14.2% (p=2.8 x 10-7) of SDQ variance at 3yo.

However, in pregnant women with suspected DVT and an initial negative US, serial US is generally recommended. We aimed to determine the ability of single negative US to exclude DVT in symptomatic pregnant women. Methods Two authors independently reviewed the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception until February 2019. We assessed the risk of bias using the CLARITY group tool for prognostic studies and performed a random effects meta-analysis to report the pooled false negative rate of a single leg ultrasound. Results Eight studies (seven prospective and one retrospective) were included. An overlap among study populations was identified in four of the manuscripts. Two authors performed data re-extraction from these hard copy research charts. Risk of bias was low for the included populations and method of measurement, and low or high for completeness of follow up. A total of 635 pregnant patients with symptoms of DVT had an initial negative US examination. Of those, six were diagnosed with DVT during repeat serial testing (0.94%) and three developed DVT or PE during 3-month follow-up after serial ultrasonography (0.47%). The pooled false-negative rate of a single ultrasound was 1.27% (95% confidence interval, 0.42-2.56), I2 = 27%.

A deletion of one copy of the entire ATM gene was identified by routine panel testing and further characterized by chromosomal microarray analysis. An 11q22.3 microdeletion of approximately 96 kb was identified that is predicted to result in loss of 1 genes including ATM. The deletion was identified in two additional family members including a presymptomatic daughter and an affected sibling. A normal disomic complement of the 11q22.3 region was detected in a third family member with a history of prostate and pancreatic cancer. Additional family members were not available for testing. Given available evidence that ATM haploinsufficiency can increase cancer risk, we predict that the observed copy number loss has likely contributed to hereditary cancer in this family. However, absence of the familial microdeletion in at least one affected family member suggests that ATM deletions are unlikely the sole contributing factor influencing tumor development in affected individuals. This case highlights 11q22.3 microdeletions of the ATM gene region as a possible risk factor for hereditary cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The same case provides a further cautionary tale for over interpretation of cancer risk associated tumor suppressor microdeletions and suggests that the variant may not be sufficient for tumor development or may modify the cancer risks associated with other, yet unidentified hereditary cancer genes.",2020-01-01,Cancer genetics,https://openalex.org/V4210168666,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2019.10.003,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980086543,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2019.10.003,journal-article,2980086543

Clinical presentation A 50-yr-old male presented with left sided trigeminal neuralgia refractory to medical management. The patient underwent retromastoid craniectomy for possible microvascular decompression. Intra-operatively, the trigeminal nerve appeared to be focally enlarged with a sausage-like configuration. We selectively resected 1 fascicle which was predominantly involved. Histopathological examination revealed onion bulb formations composed of Schwann cells around centrally placed axons. A diagnosis of HIN was made. Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusion This is the third case of isolated trigeminal nerve HIN in the literature.

Preparations were stimulated with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10−6 M) in order to maintain stable rates of H+, Na+, and K+ transport across the distal caecum. Transepithelial potential (TEP), basolateral membrane potential (Vb), and H+, Na+ and K+ fluxes all declined after the addition of a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VA) inhibitor, n-ethlymaleimide (NEM), consistent with a primary role for VA in energizing ion transport across the distal gastric caecum. Amiloride also inhibited H+, Na+, and K+ fluxes, consistent with an apically expressed VA that is coupled to a cation:H+ antiporter (AeNHE8), analogous to the coupling of apical VA and cation:nH+ antiporter in Malpighian tubules. A working model of transport of H+, Na+ and K+ across the distal gastric caecum proposes that coupling of VA and AeNHE8 in the apical membrane leads to the removal of intracellular Na+ or K+, thus creating favourable ion gradients to promote the activity of two transporters in the basal membrane, cation:H+ antiporter (AeNHE3) and a bumetanide-sensitive cation chloride cotransporter (CCC).",2020-02-01,Journal of Insect Physiology,https://openalex.org/V98276404,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103997,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996554726,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103997,journal-article,2996554726

Although this framework was initially developed to account for the perceptual benefits associated with feature conjunction repetitions, the present series of experiments examines how the core processes of this framework may also help explain behavior in tasks that require explicit remembering of visual information over the short term. Building off our previous work (Fiacconi & Milliken, 2012, 2013), here we introduce a procedure that affords the opportunity to examine the contributions of object-file review processes to both speeded performance and visual short-term memory (VWM) within the same task. Across two experiments we demonstrate a novel coupling between memory accuracy and speeded performance, such that the conditions that promote faster performance also tend to produce better memory, and vice versa. These findings are discussed in relation to the object-file framework and suggest that the object-file review processes known to guide behavior in speeded performance tasks may also have important mnemonic consequences.

Important subterranean conditions contributing to the suitability of overwintering habitat for S. catenatus includes the availability of an unflooded space and temperatures above 0 °C which is conceptualized as the resilience zone. Here, we show that the timing and duration of resilience zone loss varies between years and among sites in response to variable weather conditions. Peatland habitat occupied by snakes lost the resilience zone fewer times and for shorter durations than unconfirmed habitat. In some cases occupied habitat continuously provided a resilience zone, suggesting that snakes may only be able to tolerate short periods of unsuitable conditions. As expected, larger precipitation events resulted in greater reduction of the resilience zone size. In particular, rain on snow events resulted in the greatest change in resilience zone size and could increase the risk of mortality events. With extreme weather-related events predicted to increase with climate change, long-term conservation of climate-sensitive species should focus on protecting habitats that are naturally resilient to changing and variable weather conditions and identifying vulnerable habitats that would benefit from additional research on adaptive management strategies.",2020-06-01,Global Ecology and Conservation,https://openalex.org/V2765061010,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00923,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000223993,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00923,journal-article,3000223993

Worked examples, which show the learner the logic behind the solving of a problem, can decrease extraneous load. However, there is little research to guide the optimal formatting of worked examples.In a crossover design, first-year medical students were randomised to worked examples of bradycardias with salient features first and tachycardias with discriminatory features second (n = 33) or worked examples of bradycardias with discriminatory features first and tachycardias with salient features second (n = 32). After each learning phase, participants completed a testing phase. Diagnostic accuracy and reported cognitive load were compared between the two worked example formats, as well as with data for a group of historical controls, consisting of medical students interpreting electrocardiogram rhythms without worked examples. Each module concluded with a questionnaire in which the learner was asked to rate his or her perceptions of the difficulty of the core content, the clarity with which the information was presented, and perceived learning.Worked examples highlighting salient and discriminatory features were associated with similar levels of diagnostic accuracy (56% and 60%, respectively; P = .32).

Here, we show that four genes identified for an Inappropriate Vulval cell Proliferation (ivp) phenotype in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae exhibit distinct functions and genetic interactions when compared with their orthologs in C. elegans. Specifically, we show that the four C. briggsae ivp genes encode the noncanonical histone HTZ-1/H2A.z and three nematode-specific proteins predicted to function in the nucleus. The mutants exhibit ectopic vulval precursor cell proliferation (the multivulva [Muv] phenotype) due to inappropriate expression of the lin-3/EGF gene, and RNAseq analysis suggests a broad role for these ivp genes in transcriptional repression. Importantly, although the C. briggsae phenotypes have parallels with those seen in the C. elegans synMuv system, except for the highly conserved HTZ-1/H2A.z, comparable mutations in C. elegans ivp orthologs do not exhibit synMuv gene interactions or phenotypes.

The standard injury assessment tool is the ""legform,"" a device that mimics the human lower limb under impact loads. These devices are designed to identify the impact load that will cause the onset of injury, rather than replicate the type and severity of fracture. Thus, this study is the first to determine if composite tibias made by Sawbones (Pacific Research Labs, Vashon, WA, USA) designed for orthopedic biomechanics research, could also potentially be used for traffic safety research by simulating both the damage tolerance of human cadaveric tibias for peak force and bending moment and the fracture patterns themselves, thereby more accurately predicting injury type during real-world pedestrian-vehicle collisions.Methods: Synthetic tibias (n = 6) and human cadaveric tibias (n = 6) were impacted at midshaft at 8.3 m/s (i.e., 3 km/h) under 3-point bending using a pneumatic impacting apparatus. Fracture force, bending moment, and fracture patterns were compared between the two groups, and Weibull survivability curves generated for force and moment results, to identify injury risk thresholds.Results: There was no difference for synthetic vs. cadaveric tibias regarding impact force (4271+/-938 N vs. 4889+/-993 N, p = 0.44) or bending moment at fracture (275+/-64 Nm vs. 302+/-107 Nm, p = 0.69). Force-time curves for all tibias were similar in shape based on the first three Principal Components (p > 0.14). Weibull survivability curves had differences in shape and in the 10% risk of fracture limits, with force thresholds of 287 N for the synthetic vs. 338 N for the cadaveric, and bending moment limits of 18 Nm for the synthetic compared to 15 Nm for the cadaveric. All fracture patterns were clinically realistic, but not consistent between groups. The coefficient of variation for synthetic tibias was >0.2 for both peak force and bending moment, which precludes their use as a reproducible test surrogate for injury prediction.Conclusions: Synthetic composite tibias offer the potential for developing a frangible test surrogate, and matched cadaveric response in several respects. However, the repeatability was not high enough for them to be used in their present form for injury prediction.",2020-02-05,Traffic Injury Prevention,https://openalex.org/V196493665,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2020.1714603,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004556409,https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2020.1714603,journal-article,3004556409

The bivariate random-effects model is currently widely used to synthesize a pair of test sensitivity and specificity using logit transformation across studies. This model assumes a bivariate normal distribution for the random-effects. However, this assumption is restrictive and can be violated. When the assumption fails, inferences could be misleading. In this paper, we extended the current bivariate random-effects model by assuming a flexible bivariate skew-normal distribution for the random-effects in order to robustly model logit sensitivities and logit specificities. The marginal distribution of the proposed model is analytically derived so that parameter estimation can be performed using standard likelihood methods. The method of weighted-average is adopted to estimate the overall logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity. An extensive simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed model compared to other standard models. Overall, the proposed model performs better in terms of confidence interval width of the average logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity compared to the standard bivariate linear mixed model and bivariate generalized linear mixed model. Simulations have also shown that the proposed model performed better than the well-established bivariate linear mixed model in terms of bias and comparable with regards to the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the between-study (co)variances.

Given its single-member plurality electoral system and ethno-geographically segregated electoral landscape, what kind of ethnic parties are likely to be electable? This paper addresses these questions by examining how Myanmar’s electoral system affects the electability of small ethnic parties and party system stability. Specifically, we compare the mechanical and psychological effects of the electoral system on ethnic parties and voters since the creation of an ethnically segregated geographical landscape after 2008. For mechanical effects, we compare the degree of disproportionality, extra or ‘bonus’ seats, and how malapportionment affects small ethnic parties. For psychological effects, we examine how electoral experiences shape voting behavior and ethnic party strategy. Our findings, based on limited electoral data and recent party developments, indicate that, in addition to the mechanical effects of electoral institutions, the electoral success of ethnic parties are dependent on the geographic distribution of seats, concentration of voter support, strategic fielding of candidates in underpopulated constituencies, and co-ordination with other parties to prevent vote splitting.",2020-03-03,The European Journal of Development Research,https://openalex.org/V104805611,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-020-00264-1,431,456,32,2,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010090103,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-020-00264-1,journal-article,3010090103

Research has revealed that assigning a failing grade in a practice profession is not always a straightforward task; however, passing students who are incompetent in their nursing practice could have a deleterious impact on the quality and delivery of patient care. METHODS The author interviewed eight clinical instructors who had failed unsatisfactory students to gain an in-depth understanding of each instructor's experience in evaluating these students. Gadamer's hermeneutic principles were used to interpret the interview texts and dialogue with the participants through the hermeneutic circle of understanding, use of the researcher's prior experience and openness to new understanding. FINDINGS The experiences of the clinical instructors in this study suggest that they have struggled with their emotions, particularly when they were novices, during the multiple personal, professional and organisational challenges that they have encountered within their teaching roles and responsibilities. DISCUSSION The difficulties and challenges highlighted in this study may offer insight for academic stakeholders in nursing schools on how to mitigate these issues through developing an onboarding orientation and mentorship programme that will support faculty member development in the evaluation of unsatisfactory student performance.",2020-02-01,The Clinical Teacher,https://openalex.org/V2280673,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13019,58,63,17,1,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2929070398,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13019,journal-article,2929070398

Intersecting social identities may have an impact on the perception of burden by family caregivers of older persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction of social factors on the burden of caring for older adults with MCC. A total of 194 caregivers of older adults with MCC were recruited from Alberta and Ontario. Survey data were collected at two time points, six months apart. Additive and multiplicative models were analysed using a generalised linear model to determine the level of caregiver burden. Medium-high social interference (impact on social life) was associated with higher burden when adjusted for age, gender, education, and employment status. The overall results of the five-way interaction suggest that males in general had lower burden scores than females. Irrespective of their education and employment status, females had generally higher burden scores.

Patients were included if they had a thyroid nodule that had an ultrasound assessment with subsequent fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) as well as surgical resection. Patients were excluded if they had previous head and neck surgery. Patients were stratified into those who had a formal modified TIRADS report by the radiologist versus those who had an ultrasound report without TIRADS reporting. FNAB results were reported as per Bethesda Thyroid Cytology Criteria, and the final pathology report was nominalized as malignant or benign.One hundred twenty-four consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria listed above were included within the study. Thirty one patients (25%) had a modified TIRADS report from the radiologist, whereas 9 patients (75%) did not. There was no statistical significance between the two groups in terms of: gender (P = .24), age (P = .77), FNAB results (P = .95), final surgical pathology (P = .90), or incidental findings of malignancy (P = .09). Comparative analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the concordance of FNAB and a final pathological diagnosis of malignancy (P = .91).Despite the known diagnostic utility of the TIRADS in relation to FNAB results and its widespread use, this study shows that the overall detection of malignancy is not statistically different in those who received a modified TIRADS report.3 Laryngoscope, 130: 2087-2091, 2020.",2020-01-11,Laryngoscope,https://openalex.org/V86387881,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28476,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000324983,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28476,journal-article,3000324983

They rely on surrogates to make decisions for them. Who should be the decision-maker when an infant’s biological parents are also minors? In this paper, we analyse a case in which the biological mother is a child. The central questions raised by the case are whether minor parents should make medical decisions on behalf of an infant, and if so, what are the limits to this decision-making authority? In particular, can they refuse treatment that might be considered best for the infant? We examine different ethical arguments to underpin parental decision-making authority; we argue that provided that minor parents are capable of fulfilling their parental duties, they should have a right to make medical decisions for their infant. We then examine the ethical limits to minor parents’ decision-making authority for their children. We argue that the restricted authority that teenagers are granted to make medical decisions for themselves looks very similar to the restricted autonomy of all parents. That is, they are permitted to make choices, but not harmful choices. Like all parents, minor parents must not abuse or neglect their children and must also promote their welfare. They have a moral right to make medical decisions for their infants within the same ‘zone of parental discretion’ that applies to adult parents.

We find that when the lottery task is conducted using tokens (with monetary value), there is a significant break-even effect but an insignificant house-money effect. However, when the lottery task is conducted using a digital media of exchange, what we label “e-coins,” there is a significant house-money effect and no break-even effect. Finally, with cash, there are both significant break-even and house-money effects.

Due to advances in fetal and neonatal medicine, the first generation of ELBW survivors have survived to adulthood and become parents. However, no studies have investigated the transmission of their stress vulnerability to their offspring. We explored this phenomenon using a population-based cohort of ELBW survivors and normal birth weight (NBW) controls. Using data from three generations, we examined whether the shyness and parenting stress of ELBW and NBW participants (Generation 2) mediated the relation between the parenting style of their parents (Generation 1) and shyness in their offspring (Generation 3), and the extent to which exposure to perinatal adversity (Generation 2) moderated this mediating effect. We found that among ELBW survivors, parenting stress (in Generation 2) mediated the relation between overprotective parenting style in Generation 1 (grandparents) and child shyness in Generation 3.

Objective The purpose of this study was to understand if and how dissemination of mobility information through the Portal impacts physical activity (PA) in older adults. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, participants (n=510) were assigned to a 12-week mobility-focused KT intervention or self-serve control group. The intervention included weekly email alerts and a study-specific social media hashtag linking to mobility-focused Portal materials. The control group was able to access the Portal on their own but did not receive targeted KT strategies. Participants completed questionnaires (including the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity to quantify PA) at baseline, end of the study, and 3-month follow-up. Results Participants were predominantly female (430/510, 84.3%), mean age 64.7 years, with no baseline differences between groups. Over half (277/510, 54.3%) of the participants were classified as “active” at baseline. There was no significant between-group difference in the PA category. Overall, both groups increased their PA with improvements maintained at 3-month follow-up (P&lt;.001). In planned subgroup analyses, the KT intervention had a significant effect for those with poor or fair baseline self-rated health (P=.03). Conclusions No differences were found between those who received the targeted intervention and a control group with self-serve access to the Portal, except in subgroups with low self-rated health. Both groups did report increases in PA that were sustained beyond participation in a research study. Findings suggest that different KT strategies may be needed for different types of users, with more intense interventions being most impactful for certain groups (ie, those with lower self-rated health).
