Decision-makers in multinational enterprises have undertaken various types of actions to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic. In most cases these actions relate in some way to managing distance and to rethinking boundaries, whether at the macro- or firm-levels. Managing distance and rethinking boundaries have been the primary focus of much IB research since the IB field was established as a legitimate area of academic inquiry. The pandemic has led to increased cross-border distance problems (e.g., as the result of travel bans and reduced international mobility), and often also to new intra-firm distancing challenges imposed upon previously co-located employees. Prior IHRM research has highlighted the difficulties presented by distance, in terms of employee selection, training, support, health and safety, as well as leadership and virtual collaboration. Much of this thinking is applicable to solve pandemic-related distance challenges. The present, extreme cases of requisite physical distancing need not imply equivalent increases in psychological distance, and also offer firms some insight into the unanticipated benefits of a virtual workforce – a type of workforce that, quite possibly, will influence the ‘new normal’ of the post-COVID world. Extant IHRM research does offer actionable insight for today, but outstanding knowledge gaps remain. Looking ahead, we offer three domains for future IHRM research: managing under uncertainty, facilitating international and even global work, and redefining organizational performance.",2020-06-02,Journal of International Business Studies,https://openalex.org/V38024979,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41267-020-00335-9,697,713,51,5,1,196,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032823759,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41267-020-00335-9,journal-article,3032823759

All potential pharmacological interventions have failed in clinical trials, meaning that symptom management is the only treatment option. The water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is expressed in astrocytes and mediates water flux across the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers. Here we show that AQP4 cell-surface abundance increases in response to hypoxia-induced cell swelling in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Calmodulin directly binds the AQP4 carboxyl terminus, causing a specific conformational change and driving AQP4 cell-surface localization. Inhibition of calmodulin in a rat spinal cord injury model with the licensed drug trifluoperazine inhibited AQP4 localization to the blood-spinal cord barrier, ablated CNS edema, and led to accelerated functional recovery compared with untreated animals. We propose that targeting the mechanism of calmodulin-mediated cell-surface localization of AQP4 is a viable strategy for development of CNS edema therapies.",2020-05-14,Cell,https://openalex.org/V110447773,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.037,784,799.e19,181,4,1,169,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3025713031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.037,journal-article,3025713031

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods— Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results— A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions— We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management.

Oxidized carbon materials have proven to be promising catalysts due to their low cost and facile synthetic procedures. However, the nature of the active sites is still controversial, and direct experimental evidence is presently lacking. Here, we activate a carbon material with dangling edge sites and then decorate them with targeted functional groups. We show that quinone-enriched samples exhibit high selectivity and activity with a H 2 O 2 yield ratio of up to 97.8 % at 0.75 V vs. RHE. Using density functional theory calculations, we identify the activity trends of different possible quinone functional groups in the edge and basal plane of the carbon nanostructure and determine the most active motif. Our findings provide guidelines for designing carbon-based catalysts, which have simultaneous high selectivity and activity for H 2 O 2 synthesis.",2020-05-05,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15782-z,,,11,1,1,127,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022855257,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15782-z,journal-article,3022855257

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Data sources Ovid MEDLINE(R), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley) and reference lists of relevant articles up to 2 January 2019. Inclusion criteria Randomised trials comparing different levels of sodium intake undertaken among adult populations with estimates of intake made using 24 hour urinary sodium excretion. Data extraction and analysis Two of three reviewers screened the records independently for eligibility. One reviewer extracted all data and the other two reviewed the data for accuracy. Reviewers performed random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. Results 13 studies with 1 19 participants were included. The mean reductions (reduced sodium v usual sodium) of 24 hour urinary sodium, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 1 mmol (95% confidence interval 1 to 145, P&lt;0.001), 4.26 mm Hg (3.62 to 4.89, P&lt;0.001), and 2.07 mm Hg (1.67 to 2.48, P&lt;0.001), respectively. Each 5 mmol reduction in 24 hour sodium excretion was associated with a 1.1 mm Hg (0.6 to 1.54; P&lt;0.001) reduction in SBP and a 0.3 mm Hg (0.0 to 0.63; P=0.03) reduction in DBP. Reductions in blood pressure were observed in diverse population subsets examined, including hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals. For the same reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium there was greater SBP reduction in older people, non-white populations, and those with higher baseline SBP levels. In trials of less than  days’ duration, each 5 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium excretion was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.70; P=0.002) SBP fall, less than half the effect observed in studies of longer duration (2.13 mm Hg; 0.8 to 3.40; P=0.002). Otherwise, there was no association between trial duration and SBP reduction. Conclusions The magnitude of blood pressure lowering achieved with sodium reduction showed a dose-response relation and was greater for older populations, non-white populations, and those with higher blood pressure. Short term studies underestimate the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure.

First defined in 2005 during the World Congress of Gastroenterology, CCM criteria consisted of echo- cardiographic parameters to identify subclinical cardiac dysfunction in the absence of overt structural abnormalities. Significant advancements in cardiovascular imaging over the past 1 years, including the integration of myocardial deformation imaging into routine clinical practice to identify subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction, have rendered the 2005 CCM criteria obsolete. Therefore, new criteria based on contemporary cardiovascular imaging parameters are needed. In this guidance document, assembled by a group of multidisciplinary experts in the field, new core criteria based on contemporary cardiovascular imaging parameters are proposed for the assessment of CCM.

However, costly biomass harvesting, insufficient biomass productivity, and energy-intensive extraction methods are major bottlenecks restricting their large-scale development. To break through such limitations, researchers have focused on the technologies towards consolidating microalgal-bacterial consortia, which exhibit numerous advantages related to economy, energy, and environment, due to the cooperative interactions between microalgae and bacteria. This paper recapitulates the most recent work on microalgal-bacterial interaction mechanisms, and describes the diverse biotechnological applications of microalgal-bacterial consortia. Based on this review, the interaction mechanisms cover substrate exchange, cell-to-cell signaling, and horizontal gene transfer. Nutrient availability, growth phase, and cultivation conditions are major factors affecting their interactions. In terms of wastewater treatment, attached microalgal-bacterial consortia are economically feasible and technically superior compared to suspended microalgal-bacterial consortia. Appropriate carrier, bioreactor type, operation mode, operational factor, and further perspectives for engineering attached microalgal-bacterial consortia are critically assessed. Bacteria play an important role in promoting microalgal growth, enhancing bio-flocculation and facilitating cell wall disruption, and thus expanding the application potential of microalgal biofuel production. The current state of other promising biotechnological applications of microalgal-bacterial consortia (particularly mitigation of CO2 emissions, microalgal bloom control, and electricity generation) and the appropriate strategies to enhance their practical applications are discussed.

Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between prediagnosis and postdiagnosis PA and survival (cancer-specific, all-cause, and cardiovascular disease mortality) for all cancers and by tumor site. Secondary objectives were to examine the associations within population subgroups, by PA domain, and to determine the optimal dose of PA related to survival.PubMed, EMBASE, and SportsDiscus databases were searched from inception to November 1, 2018.

However, poor room temperature Li-ion conductivity of polymer-based solid electrolyte is the biggest challenge for their practical utilization. Here, a flexible composite polymer-ceramic electrolyte (CPE) comprising of PVDF and garnet-type Li6.5La2.5Ba0.5ZrTaO12 for room temperature all-solid-state-Li-S battery (ASLSB) is demonstrated. The PVDF-garnet CPE exhibits a high Li-ionic conductivity of 0.34 mS cm−1 at 20 °C. PVDF-garnet-based CPEs are not electrochemically stable and undergoes severe dehydro-fluorination upon galvanostatic cycling with Li electrode. For the first time, PVDF-garnet-based CPEs are modified with LiF additive, evidenced by steady galvanostatic cycling at 0.2 mA cm−2 for more than 800 h. The effect of LiF addition on the stability of PVDF-based CPEs is explained by XPS studies and electrochemical measurements. ASLSB fabricated with the modified CPE displays a high specific capacity of 936 mA h g−1 with 0.1C rate at 20 °C, along with very good stable performances over 80 continuous cycles. The ASLSB also shows very good rate capability and high Coulombic efficicency.

We discuss this tool’s main tenets, advantages, and disadvantages.

In rodents, elevation of the endocannabinoid anandamide due to inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) facilitates fear extinction and protects against the anxiogenic effects of stress. We recently reported that elevated anandamide levels in people homozygous for a loss-of-function FAAH mutation are associated with a similar phenotype, suggesting a translational validity of the preclinical findings. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine study, healthy adults were randomized to an FAAH inhibitor (PF-04457845,  mg orally, once daily; n = 16) or placebo (n = 29) for 1 days. On days  and 10, participants completed a task battery assessing psychophysiological indices of fear learning, stress reactivity, and stress-induced affective responses. Results FAAH inhibition produced a 10-fold increase in baseline anandamide. This was associated with potentiated recall of fear extinction memory when tested 2 hours after extinction training. FAAH inhibition also attenuated autonomic stress reactivity, assessed via electrodermal activity, and protected against stress-induced negative affect, measured via facial electromyography. Conclusions Our data provide preliminary human evidence that FAAH inhibition can improve the recall of fear extinction memories and attenuate the anxiogenic effects of stress, in a direct translation of rodent findings.

The search strategy included a publication date limit from 196 through March 2019.Inclusion criteria were a measure of screen use; a measure of language skills; and statistical data that could be transformed into an effect size. Exclusion criteria were qualitative studies; child age older than 1 years; and language assessment preverbal.The following variables were extracted: effect size, child age and sex, screen measure type, study publication year, and study design.

The potential risks of cell-free ARGs to the receiving environment were discovered. High influent antibiotic concentration could inhibit the microbial activity of MBR sludge, whereas good antibiotic removal could be maintained because of relatively long solid retention time and high biomass retention. Approximately 61.8%-77.5% of the total antibiotics were degraded, and 22.5%-38.2% of the total antibiotics were adsorbed by MBR sludge on average. The individual antibiotic removal presented intense discrepancy because of the chemical construction and distribution coefficient of antibiotics. Aeromonas exhibited specific antibiotic resistance to ampicillin and erythromycin, Escherichia became the predominant genera in kanamycin-ARB and tetracycline-ARB, and Klebsiella and Bacteroides were the particular genera that exhibited distinct antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin. A significant correlation was found between cell-free ARG abundance and ARB content, and relatively high effluent cell-free ARG abundance facilitated the proliferation and transmission of ARB.

The most successful seismic applications of these complex pattern-identifying networks will, presumably, be those that also leverage the deterministic physical models on which we normally base our seismic interpretations. If this is true, algorithms belonging to theory-guided data science, whose aim is roughly this, will have particular applicability in our field. We have developed a theory-designed recurrent neural network (RNN) that allows single- and multidimensional scalar acoustic seismic forward-modeling problems to be set up in terms of its forward propagation. We find that training such a network and updating its weights using measured seismic data then amounts to a solution of the seismic inverse problem and is equivalent to gradient-based seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI). By refining these RNNs in terms of optimization method and learning rate, comparisons are made between standard deep-learning optimization and nonlinear conjugate gradient and limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimized algorithms. Our numerical analysis indicates that adaptive moment (or Adam) optimization with a learning rate set to match the magnitudes of standard FWI updates appears to produce the most stable and well-behaved waveform inversion results, which is reconfirmed by a multidimensional 2D Marmousi experiment.

Many Gram-negative bacteria use the type six secretion system (T6SS) to deliver toxic effectors directly into neighbouring cells. Defence against effectors requires cognate immunity proteins. However, here we show immunity-independent protection mediated by envelope stress responses in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae against a V. cholerae T6SS effector, TseH. We demonstrate that TseH is a PAAR-dependent species-specific effector highly potent against Aeromonas species but not against its V. cholerae immunity mutant or E. coli. A structural analysis reveals TseH is probably a NlpC/P60-family cysteine endopeptidase. We determine that two envelope stress-response pathways, Rcs and BaeSR, protect E. coli from TseH toxicity by mechanisms including capsule synthesis. The two-component system WigKR (VxrAB) is critical for protecting V. cholerae from its own T6SS despite expressing immunity genes. WigR also regulates T6SS expression, suggesting a dual role in attack and defence. This deepens our understanding of how bacteria survive T6SS attacks and suggests that defence against the T6SS represents a major selective pressure driving the evolution of species-specific effectors and protective mechanisms mediated by envelope stress responses and capsule synthesis.",2020-02-24,Nature microbiology,https://openalex.org/V2764926557,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0672-6,706,714,5,5,1,56,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008894341,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0672-6,journal-article,3008894341

However, the mechanism underlying the heart failure protective effects of empagliflozin remains largely unknown. Cardiac fibroblasts play an integral role in the progression of structural cardiac remodelling and heart failure, in part, by regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. The objective of this study was to determine if empagliflozin has a direct effect on human cardiac myofibroblast-mediated ECM remodelling.Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated via explant culture from human atrial tissue obtained at open heart surgery. Collagen gel contraction assay was used to assess myofibroblast activity. Cell morphology and cell-mediated ECM remodelling was examined with the use of confocal microscopy. Gene expression of profibrotic markers was assessed with the use of reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Empagliflozin significantly attenuated transforming growth factor β1-induced fibroblast activation via collagen gel contraction after 72-hour exposure, with escalating concentrations (0.5 μmol/L,  μmol/L, and  μmol/L) resulting in greater attenuation. Morphologic assessment showed that myofibroblasts exposed to empagliflozin were smaller in size with shorter and fewer number of extensions, indicative of a more quiescent phenotype. Moreover, empagliflozin significantly attenuated cell-mediated ECM remodelling as measured by collagen fibre alignment index.

These consequences are apparent even in situations that are distinct from the stress context, but how the brain links prior stressful experience to subsequent behaviors remains poorly understood. By assessing innate defensive behavior in a looming-shadow task, we show that the initiation of an escape response is preceded by an increase in the activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN neurons). This anticipatory increase is sensitive to stressful stimuli that have high or low levels of outcome control. Specifically, experimental stress with high outcome control increases CRHPVN neuron anticipatory activity, which increases escape behavior in an unrelated context. By contrast, stress with no outcome control prevents the emergence of this anticipatory activity and decreases subsequent escape behavior.

Cancer survivors’ follow-up care has been severely affected due to increased risk of infection associated with hospital attendance, limited workforce availability and other resource constraints, implementation of new protocols to screen patients impacting workflow, and concerns of patients and health care providers about risk of infection [1]. Evidence-based recommendations on how to manage cancer survivors in a pandemic are lacking and much of the general guidance (such as CDC guidelines) [2] suggests that clinic visits for cancer survivors, including routine surveillance visits to detect cancer recurrence, should be postponed [3]. Such a situation is problematic especially if the pandemic is long lasting, leaving important survivorship issues and concerns unaddressed. In the absence of appropriate guidelines, cancer survivors are at increased risk of inappropriate or inconsistent follow-up care that could have far-reaching and even life-threatening results.",2020-08-01,Supportive Care in Cancer,https://openalex.org/V50055314,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05544-4,3485,3488,28,8,1,50,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032774725,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05544-4,journal-article,3032774725

Videoconferencing, a telehealth subfield, has been mainly used for the medication management and delivery of psychological treatments for mood, adjustment and anxiety disorders, and to a lesser extent for psychotic disorders. Objectives The focus of this scoping review is on studies using videoconferencing for intervention for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and those who may be considered to be in the very early stages of psychosis (clinical high risk). The aim of this review is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and clinical benefits of videoconferencing interventions and compare them with face-to-face interventions for this population. Methods A scoping review of peer-reviewed original research on the use of videoconferencing for intervention purposes in individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder or at clinical high risk. Results Out of 13,750 citations, 6 articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation, resulting in 1 eligible studies ( N = 43 individuals). There was no study reporting on videoconferencing interventions for individuals at clinical high risk. All the studies reported that videoconferencing implementation was feasible, and most of them described high acceptance by individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. However, selection bias of studies was high, and overall methodological quality was poor.

2020,4,4,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2983534366,Real-time precise point positioning with a low-cost dual-frequency GNSS device,"In recent years, there is an increasing demand for precise positioning with low-cost GNSS devices in support of applications from self-driving cars to unmanned aerial vehicles. Although single-frequency GNSS devices are still dominant in the low-cost market to date, some GNSS manufacturers have released low-cost dual-frequency GNSS devices, which are able to track new civilian signals such as L2C or L5. With dual-frequency GNSS measurements, the ionospheric delays can be eliminated by forming ionospheric-free combinations to further improve the positioning accuracy and reliability with low-cost GNSS devices. Extensive work has been conducted in the past for precise point positioning using high-end dual-frequency GNSS receivers. For low-cost GNSS-based PPP, there are some issues that need to be addressed. One is that current low-cost dual-frequency receivers can track only civil signals but not all GPS satellites currently transmit L2C or L5 civil signals. This means that fewer dual-frequency GNSS measurements are available for position determination. Another is that the measurement quality of low-cost receivers is not as good as high-end receivers. The above will not only increase the convergence time but also affect the obtainable positioning accuracy. We propose a new method in which not only the conventional dual-frequency ionospheric-free code and phase measurements, but also the single-frequency ionosphere-corrected code measurements with precise ionospheric products, are adopted for position determination. To be more specific, ionospheric-free code and phase combinations are applied to satellites with the second civil signal, while the single-frequency ionosphere-corrected code measurement is applied to all observed satellites. Both stationary and automotive experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the new method. The field test results show that it can quickly reach half-meter accuracy in horizontal at a much faster convergence speed than the conventional DF-PPP which would usually take several minutes to reach a similar accuracy. This indicates that the new method is more suitable for mass-market applications with low-cost GNSS devices.",2020-01-01,Gps Solutions,https://openalex.org/V173595373,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-019-0922-3,,,24,1,0,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983534366,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-019-0922-3,journal-article,2983534366

In response, there is increasing application of ACEs questionnaires in clinical practice and population health surveys. Such efforts are often justified as approaches to identify ACEs, components of trauma-informed care, and/or measures to determine prevalence within epidemiological research. Unfortunately, such measures are often used without evaluating the strengths and limitations of the measures themselves. One of the most commonly used ACEs questionnaires is a ten-question version (ACEs-10), that is composed of two clusters - one asking about different types of child maltreatment, and the other asking select questions about household challenges. Unfortunately, both this questionnaire and its derivatives have substantial drawbacks that warrant careful consideration about their use. Problems include limited item coverage, collapsing of items and response options, a simplistic scoring approach, and the lack of psychometric assessment. These deficiencies are inconsistent with the standards expected for use of measures in healthcare services and research. Given these deficiencies, we recommend that these limitations are addressed before further use of ACEs-10, and its derivatives, for either clinical or research purposes.",2020-03-01,Child Abuse & Neglect,https://openalex.org/V53055215,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104331,104331,104331,101,,1,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997994161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104331,journal-article,2997994161

Pyrolysis was carried out at two different temperatures (800 °C and 1000 °C) to synthesize carbonaceous materials with two different morphologies. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are predominantly seen in the samples synthesized at lower temperature (800 °C), whereas carbon globules (CGs) are observed for the samples synthesized at higher temperature (100 °C). The PVDF-CNT composites show superior microwave shielding behavior than the PVDF-CG composites, which is attributed to the enhanced absorption of the microwave through Ohmic conduction and interfacial polarization loss. The 1-D structure of CNTs provides the required conduction path for the electrons and forms a network to trap the microwave within them via multiple scattering. The microwave absorption behavior of the composites predominantly results from the metallic nature of the embedded nanoparticles, the graphitic layer encapsulating them and the graphitic walls of the CNTs.

Enduring changes in synaptic efficacy are highly sensitive to stress, yet whether changes to astrocyte bioenergetic control of synapses contributes to stress-impaired plasticity is unclear. Here we show in mice that stress constrains the shuttling of glucose and lactate through astrocyte networks, creating a barrier for neuronal access to an astrocytic energy reservoir in the hippocampus and neocortex, compromising long-term potentiation. Impairing astrocytic delivery of energy substrates by reducing astrocyte gap junction coupling with dominant negative connexin 43 or by disrupting lactate efflux was sufficient to mimic the effects of stress on long-term potentiation. Furthermore, direct restoration of the astrocyte lactate supply alone rescued stress-impaired synaptic plasticity, which was blocked by inhibiting neural lactate uptake. This gating of synaptic plasticity in stress by astrocytic metabolic networks indicates a broader role of astrocyte bioenergetics in determining how experience-dependent information is controlled.",2020-04-24,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15778-9,,,11,1,1,49,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018483640,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15778-9,journal-article,3018483640

We explore insufficient and inappropriate treatment of collinearity and use simulations to illustrate the potential impact on results. We also show how IB researchers doing quantitative work can avoid collinearity issues that lead to spurious and unstable results. Our six principal insights are the following: first, multicollinearity does not introduce bias. It is not an econometric problem in the sense that it would violate assumptions necessary for regression models to work. Second, variance inflation factors are indicators of standard errors that are too large, not too small. Third, coefficient instability is not a consequence of multicollinearity. Fourth, in the presence of a higher partial correlation between the variables, it can paradoxically become more problematic to omit one of these variables.

As opposed to other position fixing navigation techniques, inertial navigation performs the navigation in a relative sense with respect to the initial navigation state of the moving platform. Hence, inertial navigation systems are not prone to jamming, or spoofing. Inertial navigation systems have developed vastly, from their occurrence in the 1940s up to date. The accuracy of the inertial sensors has improved over time, making inertial sensors sufficient in terms of size, weight, cost, and accuracy for navigation and guidance applications. Within the past few years, inertial sensors have developed from being purely mechanical into incorporating various technologies and taking advantage of numerous physical phenomena, from which the dynamic forces exerted on a moving body could be computed accurately. Besides, the evolution of inertial navigation scheme involved the evolution from stable-platform inertial navigation system, which were mechanically complicated, to computationally demanding strap-down inertial navigation systems. Optical sensory technologies have provided highly accurate inertial sensors, at smaller sizes. Besides, the vibratory inertial navigation technologies enabled the production of Micro-electro-machined inertial sensors that are extremely low-cost, and offer extremely low size, weight and power consumption, making them suitable for a wide range of day-to-day navigation applications. Recently, advanced inertial sensor technologies have been introduced to the industry such as nuclear magnetic resonance technology, cold-atom technology, and the re-introduction of fluid-based inertial sensors. On another note, inertial sensor errors constitute a huge research aspect in which it is intended for inertial sensors to reach level in which they could operate for substantially long operation times in the absence of updates from aiding sensors, which would be a huge leap. Inertial sensors error modeling techniques have been developing rapidly trying to ensure higher levels of navigation accuracy using lower-cost inertial sensors. In this review, the inertial sensor technologies are covered extensively, along the future trends in the inertial sensors’ technologies. Besides, this review covers a brief overview on the inertial error modeling techniques used to enhance the performance of low-cost sensors.",2020-12-01,Satellite Navigation,https://openalex.org/V3035671286,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43020-019-0001-5,,,1,1,1,48,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032120116,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43020-019-0001-5,journal-article,3032120116

A prominent feature of intracerebral haemorrhage is neuroinflammation, particularly the excessive representation of pro-inflammatory CNS-intrinsic microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages that infiltrate from the circulation. The pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages produce injury-enhancing factors, including inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases and reactive oxygen species. Conversely, the regulatory microglia/macrophages with potential reparative and anti-inflammatory roles are outcompeted in the early stages after intracerebral haemorrhage, and their beneficial roles appear to be overwhelmed by pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. In this review, we describe the activation of microglia/macrophages following intracerebral haemorrhage in animal models and clinical subjects, and consider their multiple mechanisms of cellular injury after haemorrhage. We review strategies and medications aimed at suppressing the pro-inflammatory activities of microglia/macrophages, and those directed at elevating the regulatory properties of these myeloid cells after intracerebral haemorrhage. We consider the translational potential of these medications from preclinical models to clinical use after intracerebral haemorrhage injury, and suggest that several approaches still lack the experimental support necessary for use in humans.

METHODS Data were extracted from Crohn's disease patients started on dual biologic therapy at two referral centres. Biologics utilised include infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, certolizumab and golimumab. The primary outcome was endoscopic improvement (>50% reduction in Simplified Endoscopic Score-Crohn's disease [SES-CD] or explicitly stated). Endoscopic remission (SES-CD < 3 or stated), clinical response (Crohn's disease-patient-reported outcome-2 score [PRO2] reduced by 8), clinical remission (PRO2 < 8), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also assessed.

Vancomycin forms an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with the d-Ala-d-Ala region of Lipid II, interfering with the peptidoglycan layer maturation process. Resistance to vancomycin involves degradation of this natural precursor and its replacement with d-Ala-d-lac or d-Ala-d-Ser alternatives to which vancomycin has low affinity. Through extensive research over 30 years after the initial discovery of vancomycin resistance, remarkable progress has been made in molecular understanding of the enzymatic cascades responsible. Progress has been driven by structural studies of the key components of the resistance mechanisms which provided important molecular understanding such as, for example, the ability of this cascade to discriminate between vancomycin sensitive and resistant peptidoglycan precursors. Important structural insights have been also made into the molecular evolution of vancomycin resistance enzymes. Altogether this molecular data can accelerate inhibitor discovery and optimization efforts to reverse vancomycin resistance. Here, we overview our current understanding of this complex resistance mechanism with a focus on the structural and molecular aspects.",2020-03-01,Protein Science,https://openalex.org/V156919612,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3819,654,669,29,3,1,44,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998110188,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3819,journal-article,2998110188

In other words, some other variants in the genome (genetic modifiers) may alleviate (suppress) or exacerbate (enhance) the severity of the disease, resulting in the variability of phenotypic outcomes. Thus, to truly understand the disease, we need to consider how the disease-causing variants interact with the rest of the genome in an individual.

This study aimed to identify the principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts reported in different types of reviews of research partnerships in order to obtain a better understanding of the scope of the research partnership literature. Methods This review of reviews is part of a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to synthesise the research partnership literature with five conceptually linked literature reviews. The main research question was ‘What principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts are reported in different types of research partnership approaches?’. We included articles describing a literature review of research partnerships using a systematic search strategy. We used an adapted version of the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool to assess quality. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2018. Principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts were extracted from the included reviews and analysed using direct content analysis. Results We included 8 reviews using terms describing several research partnership approaches (e.g. community-based participatory research, participatory research, integrated knowledge translation). After the analyses, we synthesised 1 overarching principles and 1 overarching strategies and grouped them into one of the following subcategories: relationship between partners; co-production of knowledge; meaningful stakeholder engagement; capacity-building, support and resources; communication process; and ethical issues related to the collaborative research activities. Similarly, we synthesised 2 overarching outcomes and impacts on researchers, stakeholders, the community or society, and the research process. Conclusions This review of reviews is the first that presents overarching principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts of research partnerships. This review is unique in scope as we synthesised literature across multiple research areas, involving different stakeholder groups. Our findings can be used as a first step to guide the initiation and maintenance of research partnerships and to create a classification system of the key domains of research partnerships, which may improve reporting consistency in the research partnership literature.

However, it remains unclear whether shorter door-to-needle times translate into better long-term outcomes. Objective To examine whether shorter door-to-needle times with intravenous tPA for acute ischemic stroke are associated with improved long-term outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study included Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older who were treated for acute ischemic stroke with intravenous tPA within 4.5 hours from the time they were last known to be well at Get With The Guidelines–Stroke participating hospitals between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2016, with 1-year follow-up through December 31, 2017. Exposures Door-to-needle times for intravenous tPA. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were 1-year all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, and the composite of all-cause mortality or readmission. Results Among the 61 426 patients treated with tPA within 4.5 hours, the median age was 8 years and 43.5% were male. The median door-to-needle time was 65 minutes (interquartile range, 49-88 minutes). The 48 666 patients (79.2%) who were treated with tPA and had door-to-needle times of longer than 45 minutes, compared with those treated within 45 minutes, had significantly higher all-cause mortality (35.0% vs 30.8%, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.09-1.18]), higher all-cause readmission (40.8% vs 38.4%; adjusted HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.12]), and higher all-cause mortality or readmission (56.0% vs 52.1%; adjusted HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.06-1.12]). The 34 367 patients (55.9%) who were treated with tPA and had door-to-needle times of longer than 60 minutes, compared with those treated within 60 minutes, had significantly higher all-cause mortality (35.8% vs 32.1%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.1 [95% CI, 1.07-1.14]), higher all-cause readmission (41.3% vs 39.1%; adjusted HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.04-1.10]), and higher all-cause mortality or readmission (56.8% vs 53.1%; adjusted HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10]). Every 15-minute increase in door-to-needle times was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.02-1.05]) within 9 minutes after hospital arrival, but not after 9 minutes (adjusted HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.99-1.03]), higher all-cause readmission (adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), and higher all-cause mortality or readmission (adjusted HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]).

We prepared nanocomposites by dispersing of varying microstructure and magnetic properties Barium-Lead hexaferrite (BaxPb1−xFe12O19; x = 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.0) particles and polyaniline (PANI) (light weight conducting species) a in microwave transparent paraffin wax matrix. The EMI shielding behavior of the nanocomposites was studied in the 8–18 GHz frequency band. The hexaferrite powder samples used in the nanocomposites were synthesized by the sol–gel method followed by calcination at 1000°C. The electron micrographs confirm that the pure Pb-hexaferrite sample (x = 0) contains well defined hexagonal plate-like particles. With increase in Ba-content in the samples, the hexagonal particles transform to smaller spherical particles, and the magnetic properties such as coercivity and saturation magnetization change. These modifications in the morphology and magnetic properties of the samples facilitate high attenuation of microwave radiation in our developed nanocomposites. The conducting species (PANI) reflects the microwave from its surface but absorbs it through conduction-loss (Ohmic absorption), whereas the (non-conducting) magnetic Ba-Pb hexaferrite particles absorb the microwave through ferromagnetic resonance but scatter it from their surface due to impedance mismatch. The scattered waves normally increase the electromagnetic smog outside the specimen. To reduce this EM-smog, the Ba-Pb hexaferrite-PANI-Wax nanocomposites provide a synergy among all the electrical and magnetic properties, which leads to very high attenuation through absorption of the scattered electromagnetic wave. Our work demonstrates that the nanocomposites containing Ba-Pb hexaferrite particles are not only efficient in shielding microwave radiation but also help in controlling the electromagnetic-smog.",2020-03-01,Journal of Electronic Materials,https://openalex.org/V127985767,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07478-y,1618,1629,49,3,0,41,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2965991721,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07478-y,journal-article,2965991721

In recent years supply chain finance (SCF) has become promising solutions to alleviate SMEs' financing problem, which takes advantage of supply chain integrity and relies on core enterprises to promote SMEs' financing. In this paper, by taking the risk of financing participants into account, we set up a framework of SCF based on a general supply chain contract. We discuss the equilibrium strategies under three financing modes respectively and the bank's decision-making, thereafter we analyze the financing mode decision under the general financing framework. We show that the wholesale price decision is related to the initial working capital of the retailer. Also, the critical initial working capital is affected by demand distribution, supply chain contract and interest rate. Moreover, reasonable wholesale price can eliminate SCF risk and guide the retailer's ordering and the bank's interest rate decision.

The application of artificial intelligence in AGS modelling has shown promising results but is still at its early stages. This work investigated, for the first time, the capabilities of two artificial intelligence algorithms for the development of predictive models for AGS reactors based on influent characteristics and operational conditions: adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). The model structure adopted a two-stage modular approach. The models predicted the performance of the reactors for the unseen data with an average R2, nRMSE, sMAPE, and MASE of 9 %, 0.21, 0.06, and 0.2 for ANFIS, and 9 %, 0.07, 0.006, and 0.0 for SVR. The results showed that SVR provides more accurate predictions than ANFIS, in terms of prediction errors, and correctly predicting different types of failures.

It is recognized that environmental factors and individual lifestyles play important roles in disease susceptibility, but the link between these external risk factors and our genetics has been unclear. However, the discovery of sequence-independent heritable DNA changes (epigenetics) have helped us to explain the link between genes and the environment. Multiple diverse epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and the expression of non-coding RNA molecules affect the expression of genes that produce important changes in cellular differentiation and function, influencing the health and adaptability of the organism. CVDs such as congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are now being viewed as much more complex and dynamic disorders. The role of epigenetics in these and other CVDs is currently under intense scrutiny, and we can expect important insights to emerge, including novel biomarkers and new approaches to enable precision medicine.

However, our understanding of structure-function relationships for this emerging class of RNAs has been limited to secondary structures. Here, we report the 3-D atomistic structural study of epigenetic lncRNA, Braveheart (Bvht) , and its complex with CNBP (Cellular Nucleic acid Binding Protein). Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we elucidate the ensemble of Bvht RNA conformations in solution, revealing that Bvht lncRNA has a well-defined, albeit flexible 3-D structure that is remodeled upon CNBP binding. Our study suggests that CNBP binding requires multiple domains of Bvht and the RHT/AGIL RNA motif. We show that RHT/AGIL, previously shown to interact with CNBP, contains a highly flexible loop surrounded by more ordered helices.

Both intrinsic changes in the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population and extrinsic factors in the lesion microenvironment of older subjects contribute to this decline. Microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages are critical for successful remyelination, releasing growth factors and clearing inhibitory myelin debris. Several studies have implicated delayed recruitment of macrophages/microglia into lesions as a key contributor to the decline in remyelination observed in older subjects. Here we show that the decreased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36 of aging mouse microglia and human microglia in culture underlies their reduced phagocytic activity. Overexpression of CD36 in cultured microglia rescues the deficit in phagocytosis of myelin debris. By screening for clinically approved agents that stimulate macrophages/microglia, we have found that niacin (vitamin B3) upregulates CD36 expression and enhances myelin phagocytosis by microglia in culture. This increase in myelin phagocytosis is mediated through the niacin receptor (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2). Genetic fate mapping and multiphoton live imaging show that systemic treatment of 9–12-month-old demyelinated mice with therapeutically relevant doses of niacin promotes myelin debris clearance in lesions by both peripherally derived macrophages and microglia. This is accompanied by enhancement of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell numbers and by improved remyelination in the treated mice.

The method is based on graphene exfoliation in inorganic electrolytes (e.g. (NH4)2HPO4 and (NH4)2SO4 and different combinations of these salts) where the electrolyte composition was found to have a significant impact on the yield, morphology, structure, and high-temperature stability of the graphene sheets. The graphene prepared using (NH4)2HPO4 electrolyte showed the lowest level of defects in comparison to the other electrochemically exfoliated graphene and an exceptional high-temperature stability in air, at temperatures of up to 750 °C; much higher than typical high surface area carbon materials which are unstable around 400 °C–500 °C in air. The addition of (NH4)2SO4 to the (NH4)2HPO4 electrolyte improved the exfoliation process and increased the production of single layer graphene sheets from 19% to ∼50%. These hybrid electrolytes also led to nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur tri-doped graphene sheets with a fewer defects and high-temperature stability in air. This simple process offers a promising approach for large scale preparation of doped graphene with fewer defects and exceptional properties for various applications.",2020-02-01,Carbon,https://openalex.org/V188605413,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.042,681,692,157,,1,37,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981888852,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.042,journal-article,2981888852

REM sleep exhibits a plethora of transient neurophysiological features, such as eye movements, muscle twitches, and changes in autonomic activity, however, despite its heterogeneous nature, it is usually conceptualized as a homogeneous sleep state. We propose here that differentiating and exploring the fine microstructure of REM sleep, especially its phasic and tonic constituents would provide a novel framework to examine the mechanisms and putative functions of REM sleep. In this review, we show that phasic and tonic REM periods are remarkably different neural states with respect to environmental alertness, spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, information processing, and seem to contribute differently to the dysfunctions of REM sleep in several neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The gendered nature of energy transitions is often implicit and unexplored. As a corrective, this paper explores energy pathways by applying concepts from innovations and gender studies. We examine gender perspectives and niche energy innovations which could disrupt the regime. The regime represents the mainstream pathway that includes the dominant gender perspective and energy system. We explore different gender perspectives of energy transition pathways by applying an Alternative Pathways framework that includes: (1) on-stream pathways that exist within the mainstream pathway to promote equal opportunities for women and men, as well as niches for energy innovations without challenging the high-carbon energy regime; (2) off-stream pathways that depart from the mainstream and promote differences across different genders while creating niches outside the energy regime; and (3) transformative pathways that are fundamentally different from the previous mainstream and includes all gender perspectives in a new energy regime. Applying this framing, in Canada, we explored Indigenous perspectives in the oil sands sector; in Kenya, we studied largescale renewable energy impacting Indigneous communities; in Spain, we evaluate the movement away from fossil fuels and towards renewable technologies. The framework helped to identify that mainstream pathways represented the dominant male perspective while woman's perspective were largely left out.

It carries a poor prognosis, in part because its pathogenesis is not well understood. The type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR3) is the principal intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+ ) release channel in cholangiocytes, and its increased expression has been related to the pathogenesis of malignancies in other types of tissues, so we investigated its role in CCA. ITPR3 expression was increased in both hilar and intrahepatic CCA samples as well as in CCA cell lines. Deletion of ITPR3 from CCA cells impaired proliferation and cell migration. A bioinformatic analysis suggested that overexpression of ITPR3 in CCA would have a mitochondrial phenotype, so this was also examined. ITPR3 normally is concentrated in a subapical region of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cholangiocytes, but both immunogold electron microscopy and super-resolution microscopy showed that ITPR3 in CCA cells was also in regions of ER in close association with mitochondria. Deletion of ITPR3 from these cells impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and led to cell death. Conclusion: ITPR3 expression in cholangiocytes becomes enhanced in CCA.

However, manual inspection of the images produced is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. The success of deep learning systems using camera trap images has been previously explored in preliminary stages. These studies, however, are lacking in their practicality. They are primarily focused on extremely large datasets, often millions of images, and there is little to no focus on performance when tasked with species identification in new locations not seen during training. Our goal was to test the capabilities of deep learning systems trained on camera trap images using modestly sized training data, compare performance when considering unseen background locations, and quantify the gradient of lower bound performance to provide a guideline of data requirements in correspondence to performance expectations. We use a dataset provided by Parks Canada containing 47,279 images collected from 3 unique geographic locations across multiple environments.

Combined efforts from many theoretical and experimental studies on the lipid-protein interaction profile of several GPCRs hint at an intricate relationship of these receptors with their surrounding membrane environment, with several lipids emerging as particularly important. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the lipid-protein interaction profiles of 28 different GPCRs, spanning different levels of classification and conformational states and totaling to 1 ms of simulation time. We find a close relationship with lipids for all GPCRs simulated, in particular, cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids, but the number, location, and estimated strength of these interactions is dependent on the specific GPCR as well as its conformational state. Although both cholesterol and PIP lipids bind specifically to GPCRs, they utilize distinct mechanisms. Interactions with PIP lipids are mediated by charge-charge interactions with intracellular loop residues and stabilized by one or both of the transmembrane helices linked by the loop. Interactions with cholesterol, on the other hand, are mediated by a hydrophobic environment, usually made up of residues from more than one helix, capable of accommodating its ring structure and stabilized by interactions with aromatic and charged/polar residues. Cholesterol binding to GPCRs occurs in a small number of sites, some of which (like the binding site on the extracellular side of transmembrane 6/7) are shared among many class A GPCRs. Combined with a thorough investigation of the local membrane structure, our results provide a detailed picture of GPCR-lipid interactions.

We, therefore, investigated the possible contribution of five major species of gram-negative bacteria found to be altered in presence during disease progression and evaluate their pathogenicity through LPS. We demonstrated that LPS from these different species had individual capacities to induce NF-κB and pro-inflammatory IL- production from HEK-TLR4 cells in a TLR4 dependent manner. Additional work using human intestinal colonic epithelial cell monolayers (Caco-2) demonstrated that the cells responded to the serotype specific LPS in a distinct manner, inducing many inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-1 in significantly altered proportions. Furthermore, the permeability of Caco-2 monolayers, as a test for their ability to alter intestinal permeability, was also differentially altered by the serotype specific LPS modulating trans-epithelial electrical resistance, small molecule movement, and tight junction integrity.

Intriguingly, the phylogenies of campylobacterotal CBB cycle genes suggest they were acquired in multiple transfers from Gammaproteobacteria closely related to sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts associated with the mussels, as well as from Betaproteobacteria.

We also found key CBB cycle genes in free-living Campylobacterota, suggesting that the CBB cycle may be more widespread in this phylum than previously known. Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics confirmed high expression of CBB cycle genes in mussel-associated ""Ca. Thiobarba"". Direct stable isotope fingerprinting showed that ""Ca.

Here, we combine advances in amplicon and metagenomic sequencing with culture-enriched molecular profiling to study the human microbiota. Using the cystic fibrosis lung as an example, we cultured an average of 82.13% of the operational taxonomic units representing 99.3% of the relative abundance identified in direct sequencing of sputum samples; importantly, culture enrichment identified 63.3% more operational taxonomic units than direct sequencing. We developed the PLate Coverage Algorithm (PLCA) to determine a representative subset of culture plates on which to conduct culture-enriched metagenomics, resulting in the recovery of greater taxonomic diversity—including of low-abundance taxa—with better metagenome-assembled genomes, longer contigs and better functional annotations when compared to culture-independent methods.

Novel mechanistic insights emerged at all scales of the system, from the specific nature of proarrhythmic drug interaction with the hERG channel, to the fundamental cellular and tissue-level arrhythmia mechanisms. Applications of machine learning indicate necessary and sufficient parameters that predict arrhythmia vulnerability. We expect that the model framework may be expanded to make an impact in drug discovery, drug safety screening for a variety of compounds and targets, and in a variety of regulatory processes.",2020-04-10,Circulation Research,https://openalex.org/V10652568,Ovid Technologies Wolters Kluwer -American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.119.316404,947,964,126,8,1,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009375540,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.119.316404,journal-article,3009375540

In shale rocks, the widespread existence of organic matter and the significant variation of total organic carbon (TOC) content lead to huge uncertainty on shale wettability. Therefore, this work systematically examines the dependence of shale wettability on TOC content (ranging from 1.2 wt% to 20.05 wt%). Multiple relations were probed experimentally, namely: 1) the effect of TOC content on n-dodecane (n-C12) contact angles for shale-methane (CH4)-n-C12 systems at 5 MPa and 50 °C; 2) the effect of TOC content on n-C12 contact angles for shale-carbon dioxide (CO2)-n-C12 systems at 5 MPa and 50 °C; 3) the effect of TOC content on brine contact angles for shale-brine-n-C12 systems at 0.1 MPa and 50 °C; 4) the effect of pressure (0.1 MPa–25 MPa), temperature (25 °C and 50 °C) and TOC content on brine contact angles for shale-CH4-brine systems. The results demonstrate that for shale-CH4-n-C12, shale-CO2-n-C12 and shale-brine-n-C12 systems, the affinity of n-C12 to shale increases with increasing TOC content. However, for shale-CH4-brine systems, the affinity of CH4 to shale increases firstly, then flatten out and afterwards increases again; while shale wettability shifted from water-wet to CH4-wet with TOC content increase. In addition, a larger pressure renders shale less hydrophilic while a higher temperature causes shale more hydrophilic. The temperature influence is reduced with TOC content increase. The results can aid in better understanding of shale wettability at reservoir conditions.",2020-10-01,Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,https://openalex.org/V19016632,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107374,107374,107374,193,,0,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023959747,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107374,journal-article,3023959747

Limited information is available on the spatiotemporal variation, sources, and health risks of VOCs in the coastal cities of Canada, where the population density is much higher than inland areas. In this study, we investigated ambient VOCs levels, their potential sources and associated health risks in two coastal cities in Metro Vancouver during 2012-2016. Levels of the total measured VOCs were relatively higher in an industrial region in Port Moody (56.7 μg/m3) than an urban area of Burnaby south (38.0 μg/m3). A clear seasonality was observed for VOCs species with significantly higher levels in winter than in summer except for isoprene. Alkanes were the most dominant compounds at both sites accounting for up to 59.4% of the total measured VOCs, followed by halocarbons, aromatics, and alkenes. Industrial-related emissions (30.5%) and traffic-related emissions (35.8%) were the major sources contributing to ambient VOCs in Port Moody and Burnaby south, respectively, as calculated by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. A hybrid health risk assessment strategy using deterministic and stochastic approaches revealed that non-cancer risks of ambient VOCs exposure were all below the safe level of 1 at both cities, while the cumulative cancer risks of toxic VOCs exposure in Port Moody (9.2 × 10-5) and Burnaby south (7.6 × 10-5) were significantly higher than the provincial acceptable risk level (1.0 × 10-5). Surprisingly, the probabilities for cumulative cancer risks of VOCs exceeding the US EPA tolerable risk level (1.0 × 10-4) were 33.7% and 18.6% in Port Moody and Burnaby south, respectively. From a risk management perspective, greater emphasis on the reduction of emissions of carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene is highly recommended in both cities of Metro Vancouver.",2020-03-01,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135970,135970,135970,706,,0,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996719910,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135970,journal-article,2996719910

We examine lung cancer incidence rates in young women vs. young men in 4 countries across five continents. Lung and bronchial cancer cases by 5-year age group (ages 30-64) and 5-year calendar period (1993-2012) were extracted from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Female-to-male incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated by age group and birth cohort. Among men, age-specific lung cancer incidence rates generally decreased in all countries, while in women the rates varied across countries with the trends in most countries stable or declining, albeit at a slower pace compared to those in men. As a result, the female-to-male IRRs increased among recent birth cohorts, with IRRs significantly greater than unity in Canada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United States. For example, the IRRs in ages 45-49 year in the Netherlands increased from 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8) to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.7) in those born circa 194 and 1963, respectively. Similar patterns, though nonsignificant, were found in 2 additional countries. These crossovers were largely driven by increasing adenocarcinoma incidence rates in women. For those countries with historical smoking data, smoking prevalence in women approached, but rarely exceeded, those of men. In conclusion, the emerging higher lung cancer incidence rates in young women compared to young men is widespread and not fully explained by sex differences in smoking patterns. Future studies are needed to identify reasons for the elevated incidence of lung cancer among young women.",2020-02-05,International Journal of Cancer,https://openalex.org/V5382288,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.32809,811,819,147,3,0,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004708148,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.32809,journal-article,3004708148

This study examines similarities and differences across health literacy, food literacy, nutrition literacy and health-promoting media literacy to highlight how each literacy type theorizes the relationship between education and health. A meta-review of existing scoping and systematic reviews examining literacy conceptualizations was conducted to examine the four literacies.

However, it is not feasible to manipulate granulation via direct addition of AHL chemicals or AHL-producing strains. Here, several strains with high AHL-producing capacity were successfully isolated from AGS. These QS strains were cultivated, mixed as a consortium, and then divided into two groups: AHLs supernatant and bacterial cells encapsulated in sodium alginate (CEBs). The potential of QS regulation, via doses of AHLs supernatant and CEBs, in accelerating granulation was evaluated. Results clearly indicated that short-term (days 21-70) addition of AHLs supernatant led to a rapid specific growth rate (0.08 d-1), compact structure without filamentous bacteria overgrowth, excellent settlement performance (SVI10 37.2 mL/g), and a high integrity coefficient (4.4%) of the granules. Sustainable release of AHLs (mainly C6- and C8-HSL) was induced by exogenous AHLs, possibly attributed to the enrichment of the genera Aeromonas and Pseudomonas. Further, tryptophan and aromatic protein substances were produced to maintain structural stability, suggesting that short-term QS regulation had long-term positive effects on the characteristics of AGS. By comparison, the addition of CEBs posed negligible or negative impact on the granulation, as evidenced by the rupture of smaller aggregates and poor characteristics of AGS. Overall, augmentation of the signaling content via addition of AHLs supernatant from QS strains is an economical and feasible regulation strategy to accelerate granulation and sustain long-term structural stability.",2020-02-01,Water Research,https://openalex.org/V52566953,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115193,115193,115193,169,,0,33,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980510815,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115193,journal-article,2980510815

There are some drawbacks associated with steam-driven heavy oil recovery methods such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), steam flooding, and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). These cons include the high greenhouse gas footprint, low heavy oil/bitumen recovery, and difficulty in stop operation in emergency conditions. There exists a need for an improved method for recovering residual oils after applying steam injection. One of the potential technologies for doing this is chemical assisted heavy oil recovery, especially alkaline and surfactant additives. But the challenging question is how to develop a chemical-based oil recovery method considering long-term steam-rock interactions. Several associated issues of chemical additives, including adsorption behavior of surfactant at reservoir conditions and thermal stability of surfactant at steam chamber temperature, make this question more complex. This paper addresses all these concerns and provides solid knowledge regarding this technology. We delve into newly formulated chemicals for coupling with thermal oil recovery techniques that are still limited to lab-scale research, with the need for further studies. This critical review also provides the opportunities and challenges associated with chemical assisted heavy oil/bitumen production in a post-steam injection scenario.

It is known that the activity of skin is regulated by human brain. In this research, for the first time we investigate the relation between the activities of human skin and brain by mathematical analysis of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Method For this purpose, we employ fractal theory and analyze the variations of fractal dimension of GSR and EEG signals when subjects are exposed to different olfactory stimuli in the form of pleasant odors. Results Based on the obtained results, the complexity of GSR signal changes with the complexity of EEG signal in case of different stimuli, where by increasing the molecular complexity of olfactory stimuli, the complexity of EEG and GSR signals increases. The results of statistical analysis showed the significant effect of stimulation on variations of complexity of GSR signal. In addition, based on effect size analysis, fourth odor with greatest molecular complexity had the greatest effect on variations of complexity of EEG and GSR signals.

During the course of these infections, P. aeruginosa undergoes a number of genetic adaptations. One such adaptation is the loss of swimming motility functions. Another involves the formation of the rugose small colony variant (RSCV) phenotype, which is characterized by overproduction of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl. Here, we provide evidence that the two adaptations are linked. Using random transposon mutagenesis, we discovered that flagellar mutations are linked to the RSCV phenotype. We found that flagellar mutants overexpressed Pel and Psl in a surface-contact dependent manner. Genetic analyses revealed that flagellar mutants were selected for at high frequencies in biofilms, and that Pel and Psl expression provided the primary fitness benefit in this environment. Suppressor mutagenesis of flagellar RSCVs indicated that Psl overexpression required the mot genes, suggesting that the flagellum stator proteins function in a surface-dependent regulatory pathway for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Finally, we identified flagellar mutant RSCVs among CF isolates. The CF environment has long been known to select for flagellar mutants, with the classic interpretation being that the fitness benefit gained relates to an impairment of the host immune system to target a bacterium lacking a flagellum. Our new findings lead us to propose that exopolysaccharide production is a key gain-of-function phenotype that offers a new way to interpret the fitness benefits of these mutations.",2020-06-12,PLOS Genetics,https://openalex.org/V103870658,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008848,e1008848,e1008848,16,6,1,33,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034732466,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008848,journal-article,3034732466

The effectiveness of combining PAA and H2O2 at various proportions while irradiating with UVC were also evaluated. UVC/PAA (λ = 25 nm) was effective in degrading all four pharmaceuticals and followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Increasing PAA dosage or UVC intensity resulted in a linear increase in pseudo-first order rate coefficient. Both PAA in dark conditions and UVA/PAA (λ = 36 nm) were marginally effective to degrade SFX and ineffective to degrade VEN, CBZ and FLU; indicating the need for UVC irradiation for activation of PAA. For similar oxidant dosages of 5 mg/L UVC/H2O2 was found to be faster than UV/PAA for VEN, CBZ and FLU by 55%, 75% and 33%, respectively. Under similar conditions, SFX was degraded 24% faster by UV/PAA. Increase in the proportion of H2O2 to PAA in UVC/PAA/H2O2 improved kinetics of degradation compared to PAA alone.

In the USA, women and members of historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups continue to be underrepresented across STEM disciplines. One vehicle for generating and sustaining interest in STEM is providing youth long-term access to informal science education (ISE) institutions. Here, we incorporate triangulation methods, collecting and synthesizing both qualitative and quantitative data, to examine how participation in a longitudinal ISE out-of-school time (OST) program facilitated by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) impacted the STEM trajectories of 6 alumni. Findings revealed that 83.2% of alumni engaged in a STEM major, and 63.1% in a STEM career, the majority whom were females and/or members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Based on interviews with a purposeful sample of 2 AMNH alumni, we identified four program design principles that contributed to persistence in STEM: (1) affording multiple opportunities to become practitioners of science; (2) providing exposure to and repeated experiences with STEM professionals such as scientists, educators, and graduate students to build social networks; (3) furnishing opportunities for participants to develop shared science identities with like-minded individuals; and (4) offering exposure to and preparation for a variety of STEM majors and STEM careers so that youth can engage in discovering possible selves.

Here, we show how continuous translocation of gut microbial components affects iron homeostasis and facilitates susceptibility to inflammation-associated sepsis. A sub-lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide results in higher mortality in Mucin 2 deficient ( Muc2 −/− ) mice, and is associated with elevated circulatory iron load and increased bacterial translocation. Translocation of gut microbial components attenuates hepatic stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 activity, a key enzyme in hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The resulting reduction of hepatic saturated and unsaturated fatty acid levels compromises plasma membrane fluidity of red blood cells, thereby significantly reducing their life span. Inflammation in Muc2 −/− mice alters erythrophagocytosis efficiency of splenic macrophages, resulting in an iron-rich milieu that promotes bacterial growth.

The antagonistic pleiotropy theory proposes that aging is largely due to the natural selection of genes and pathways that increase fitness and decrease mortality early in life but contribute to deleterious effects and pathologies later in life. Cellular senescence is one such mechanism, which results in a permanent cell cycle arrest that has been described as a mechanism to limit cancer cell growth. However, recent studies have also suggested a dark side of senescence in which a build-up of senescent cells with age leads to increased inflammation due to a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This phenotype that includes many cytokines promotes tumorigenesis and can exhaust the pool of immune cells in the body. Studies clearing senescent cells from mice using the p16-based transgene INK-ATTAC have shown that senescent cells can impact both organismal aging and lifespan.

Altered bile acid metabolism is a common but frequently undiagnosed cause. Methods We performed a systematic search of publication databases for studies of assessment and management of bile acid diarrhea (BAD). The certainty (quality) of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome questions were developed through an iterative process and were voted on by a group of specialists. Results The certainty of evidence was generally rated as very low. Therefore, 1 of 1 recommendations are conditional. In patients with chronic diarrhea, consideration of risk factors (terminal ileal resection, cholecystectomy, or abdominal radiotherapy), but not additional symptoms, was recommended for identification of patients with possible BAD. The group suggested testing using 75selenium homocholic acid taurine (where available) or 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, including patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, functional diarrhea, and Crohn's disease without inflammation. Testing was suggested over empiric bile acid sequestrant therapy (BAST). Once remediable causes are managed, the group suggested cholestyramine as initial therapy, with alternate BAST when tolerability is an issue. The group suggested against BAST for patients with extensive ileal Crohn's disease or resection and suggested alternative antidiarrheal agents if BAST is not tolerated. Maintenance BAST should be given at the lowest effective dose, with a trial of intermittent, on-demand administration, concurrent medication review, and reinvestigation for patients whose symptoms persist despite BAST.

Integrated pore characterization methods including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low-temperature N2 and CO2 adsorption, and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) analyses were comparatively conducted in both areas in order to examine shale gas reservoir pore size variations and thus the possible microscopic pore structure controls on shale gas enrichment. The Lower Cambrian shales in both Deformed Zone (DZ) and Non-deformed Zone (NDZ) were deposited in the deep-water shelf and show similar organic matter richness and thermal maturity. The majority of organic matter (OM)-hosted pores in DZ samples are in nanoscale size range with the dominance of micro-fractures within the OM or at the interface of OM and minerals. In contrast, OM-hosted meso-(2–50 nm) to macropores (>50 nm) are the dominant pore types in the NDZ samples. OM-hosted micropores ( The Dabashan arc-like fold-thrust belt took place by the end of the Late Triassic, while the Lower Cambrian shales have reached thermal maturity peak. OM-hosted meso-(2–50 nm) to macropores (>50 nm) in DZ samples are most probably collapsed during structural deformation related to tectonic compression, while micropores due to their smaller size survived the tectonic stress. The OM-hosted micropores are the main storage space for adsorbed gas in the DZ area. The dominance of micro-pores in DZ and lack of connection between those pores and matrix pores led to higher gas content in DZ samples. On the contrary, the well-connected OM-hosted pore network in NDZ allows easier gas flow in the rock matrix that eventually led to significant gas leakage during uplift and exhumation and lower gas content in this zone.

Subaerial and subaqueous calving is an important component of glacier mass loss but they have been difficult to track due to spatiotemporal resolution limitations in remote sensing data and few field observations. In this study, we used near-daily   resolution PlanetScope imagery in conjunction with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) survey to quantify calving events and derive an empirical area–volume relationship to estimate calved glacier volume from planimetric iceberg areas. A calving event at Thulagi Glacier in 201 was observed by satellite from before and during the event to nearly complete melting of the icebergs, and was observed in situ midway through the melting period, thus giving insights into the melting processes. In situ measurements of Thulagi Lake’s surface and water column indicate that daytime sunlight absorption heats mainly just the top metre of water, but this heat is efficiently mixed downwards through the top tens of metres due to forced convection by wind-blown icebergs; this heat then is retained by the lake and is available to melt the icebergs. Using satellite data, we assess seasonal glacier velocities, lake thermal regime and glacier surface elevation change for Thulagi, Lower Barun and Lhotse Shar glaciers and their associated lakes. The data reveal widely varying trends, likely signifying divergent future evolution. Glacier velocities derived from 1960/70s declassified Corona satellite imagery revealed evidence of glacier deceleration for Thulagi and Lhotse Shar glaciers, but acceleration at Lower Barun Glacier following lake development.

However, in this article, lidar point clouds are understood from a new and universal perspective, i.e., geometric primitives embedded in versatile objects in the physical world. In lidar point clouds, the basic unit is the point coordinate. Geometric primitives that consist of a group of discrete points may be viewed as one kind of abstraction and representation of lidar data at the entity level. We categorize geometric primitives into two classes: shape primitives, e.g., lines, surfaces, and volumetric shapes, and structure primitives, represented by skeletons and edges. In recent years, many efforts from different communities, such as photogrammetry, computer vision, and computer graphics, have been made to finalize geometric primitive detection, regularization, and in-depth applications. Interpretations of geometric primitives from multiple disciplines try to convey the significance of geometric primitives, the latest processing techniques regarding geometric primitives, and their potential possibilities in the context of lidar point clouds. To this end, primitive-based applications are reviewed with an emphasis on object extraction and reconstruction to clearly show the significances of this article. Next, we survey and compare methods for geometric primitive extraction and then review primitive regularization methods that add real-world constrains to initial primitives.

Changes were estimated for mild, moderate, severe and extreme droughts for the four climatic seasons; winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and for the two major growing seasons; rabi (November to April) and kharif (May to October). Nineteen general circulation models (GCMs) of Couple Model Intercomparison Project 5 were used. The model output statistics approach was used to downscale GCM simulated rainfall for eighteen climate stations in Bangladesh. Changes in the SAF curve were computed for three periods (2010–2039, 2040–2069 and 2070–2099). The uncertainty band of the SAF relationship curve was then computed using the Bayesian bootstrap method at the 95% confidence level. The results reveal that moderate and severe drought categories have the highest return period and are likely to affect the region more than other types of droughts. The kharif season drought was found to be most pronounced and affected significant portions of the country during all return periods and severity categories. Projections also show that monsoon and kharif droughts would increase across Bangladesh in regards of severity and return period.

BACKGROUND WON is a common consequence of severe pancreatitis and typically occurs 3 to  weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis. When symptomatic, it can require intervention. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with WON undergoing surgical management at 3 high-volume pancreatic institutions was performed. Surgical indications, intervention timing, technical methodology, and patient outcomes were evaluated. Patients undergoing intervention <30 days were excluded. Differences across centers were evaluated using a P value of <0.05 as significant. RESULTS One hundred seventy-eight total patients were analyzed (mean WON diameter = 14 cm, 64% male, mean age = 5 years) across 3 centers. The majority required inpatient admission with a median preoperative length of hospital stay of 2 days (25% required preoperative critical care support). Most (96%) patients underwent a TGN. The median duration of time between the onset of pancreatitis symptoms and operative intervention was 6 days. Thirty-nine percent of the necrosum was infected. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 38% and 2%, respectively. The median postoperative length of hospital length of stay was  days, with the majority of patients discharged home. The median length of follow-up was 2 months, with 91% of patients having complete clinical resolution of symptoms at a median of  weeks. Readmission to hospital and/or a repeat intervention was also not infrequent (20%). CONCLUSION Surgical TGN is an excellent 1-stage surgical option for symptomatic WON in a highly selected group of patients. Precise surgical technique and long-term outpatient follow-up are mandatory for optimal patient outcomes.",2020-01-01,Annals of Surgery,https://openalex.org/V157664895,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer)  - Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000003048,163,168,271,1,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2894268321,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000003048,journal-article,2894268321

The GSBRs were operated with alternating (AN/O/AX/O_SBR and AN/O_SBR) and purely-aerobic (O_SBR) operation modes. Mineral-rich aerobic granules with hydroxyapatite (HAp) core were cultivated in all the three GSBRs. The highest nitrogen removal efficiency (75%) was achieved in AN/O/AX/O_SBR and O_SBR and the lowest (22%) in AN/O_SBR, establishing a quasi-linear relationship with organic loading rate (OLR). Phosphorus removal efficiencies of 55-63% were achieved in the GSBRs despite different influent PO4-P concentrations. Heterotrophic nitrification and biologically-induced phosphate precipitation (BIPP) became the dominant nutrient depletion pathways, contributing 61-84% and 39-96% to overall ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus removal, respectively. A direct relation was noted between heterotrophic nitrification efficiency (ηHeterotrophic nitrification) and nutrient availability, as nitrification efficiencies of 1 and 64% were observed for COD:Ninf of  and 20, respectively. Whereas, BIPP efficiency (ηBIPP) established inverse relation with (COD:P)inf and (Ca:P)inf and direct relation with phosphorus concentration beyond microbial growth requirement. Core heterotrophic nitrifiers and bio-calcifying species were identified as {Thauera and Flavobacterium} and {Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Corynebacterium}, respectively. Ca-P crystallization was proposed to be via phosphate precipitation on calcite surfaces.

Objective The objective of this work is to establish whether vitamin D doses up to 10 000 IU/day are safe and well tolerated. Design The Calgary Vitamin D Study was a 3-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting A single-center study was conducted at the University of Calgary, Canada. Participants Participants included healthy adults (n = 373) ages  to  years with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D  to 1 nmol/L. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to vitamin D 400, 4000, or 10 000 IU/day. Calcium supplementation was initiated if dietary calcium intake was less than 12 mg/day. Main Outcome Measures In these prespecified secondary analyses, changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, 24-hour urine calcium excretion, and incidence of adverse events were assessed. Between-group differences in adverse events were examined using incident rate differences and logistic regression. Results Of 3 participants (400: 124, 4000: 125, 10 000: 124), 49% were male, mean (SD) age was  (4) years, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 78.0 (19.5) nmol/L. Serum calcium, creatinine, and 24-hour urine calcium excretion did not differ between treatments. Mild hypercalcemia (2.56-2.64 mmol/L) occurred in  (4%) participants (400: 0%, 4000: 3%, 10 000: 9%, P = .002); all cases resolved on repeat testing. Hypercalciuria occurred in  (23%) participants (400: 17%, 4000: 22%, 10 000: 31%, P = .01). Clinical adverse events were experienced by 3 (97.9%) participants and were balanced across treatment arms. Conclusions The safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10 00 IU/day. Hypercalciuria was common and occurred more frequently with higher doses.

As modern crocodilians and birds lay hard-shelled eggs, this eggshell type has been inferred for non-avian dinosaurs. Known dinosaur eggshells are characterized by an innermost membrane, an overlying protein matrix containing calcite, and an outermost waxy cuticle2-7. The calcitic eggshell consists of one or more ultrastructural layers that differ markedly among the three major dinosaur clades, as do the configurations of respiratory pores. So far, only hadrosaurid, a few sauropodomorph and tetanuran eggshells have been discovered; the paucity of the fossil record and the lack of intermediate eggshell types challenge efforts to homologize eggshell structures across all dinosaurs8-18. Here we present mineralogical, organochemical and ultrastructural evidence for an originally non-biomineralized, soft-shelled nature of exceptionally preserved ornithischian Protoceratops and basal sauropodomorph Mussaurus eggs. Statistical evaluation of in situ Raman spectra obtained for a representative set of hard- and soft-shelled, fossil and extant diapsid eggshells clusters the originally organic but secondarily phosphatized Protoceratops and the organic Mussaurus eggshells with soft, non-biomineralized eggshells. Histology corroborates the organic composition of these soft-shelled dinosaur eggs, revealing a stratified arrangement resembling turtle soft eggshell. Through an ancestral-state reconstruction of composition and ultrastructure, we compare eggshells from Protoceratops and Mussaurus with those from other diapsids, revealing that the first dinosaur egg was soft-shelled. The calcified, hard-shelled dinosaur egg evolved independently at least three times throughout the Mesozoic era, explaining the bias towards eggshells of derived dinosaurs in the fossil record.",2020-06-17,Nature,https://openalex.org/V137773608,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2412-8,406,410,583,7816,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036946317,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2412-8,journal-article,3036946317

However, the characteristic VOC species emitted from different sources are of different ozone formation potentials (OFP). Without an in-depth understanding of the relative OFP contributions from specific sources, the effectiveness of the existing approach for controlling ground-level O 3 at the regional scale is limited. This study collected and analyzed five years (2012–2016) of monitoring data for 5 most photochemically reactive VOC species at Port Moody, an industrial city in Metro Vancouver, Canada that has experienced elevated O 3 levels in its ambience. Source-specific contributions to OFP were quantified for major VOC emitters to deliberate the underlying causes of elevated O 3 recently observed in this populated region. Six sources were identified using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, consisting of fuel production and combustion, fuel evaporation, vehicle exhaust, industrial coatings/solvents, petrochemical source, and other industrial emission. Although the top three contributors to total VOCs are fuel production and combustion (34.5%), fuel evaporation (21.4%), and vehicle exhaust (20.6%), the top three contributors to OFP are fuel production and combustion (27.1%), vehicle exhaust (23.7%), and industrial coatings/solvents (17.2%). Additionally, potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis was conducted to generate the geographical distribution of VOC and OFP sources in different seasons. The results revealed that, in the Metro Vancouver area, the OFP hotspots have been significantly different from the VOC emission hotspots. In general, regional sources, especially those located in the northeastern direction of Metro Vancouver, have greater influence on the VOCs levels. However, OFP has been predominantly affected by transportation and industrial sources at the local scale. Therefore, to formulate effective strategies for reducing ground-level O 3 , the seasonal and spatial variations of major OFP sources should be assessed by the regulatory authorities. • The ozone formation potentials (OFP) of VOC sources were estimated in Metro Vancouver. • Metro Vancouver was consistently under VOC-limited regime. • The geographical origins of ozone formation were firstly calculated and visualized in the study area. • The OFP hotspots significantly differed from the VOC emission hotspots. • Transportation and industrial sources at the local scale predominantly affected OFP.",2020-06-15,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137698,137698,137698,721,,0,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012533478,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137698,journal-article,3012533478

This adaptive process was likely not without deleterious consequences to health. Today, osteoarthritis occurs in 250 million people, with risk variants enriched in non-coding sequences near chondrocyte genes, loci that likely became optimized during knee evolution. We explore this relationship by epigenetically profiling joint chondrocytes, revealing ancient selection and recent constraint and drift on knee regulatory elements, which also overlap osteoarthritis variants that contribute to disease heritability by tending to modify constrained functional sequence. We propose a model whereby genetic violations to regulatory constraint, tolerated during knee development, lead to adult pathology. In support, we discover a causal enhancer variant (rs6060369) present in billions of people at a risk locus <i>(GDF5</i>-<i>UQCC1</i>), showing how it impacts mouse knee-shape and osteoarthritis.

During early Leishmania infection of the skin, IFN-γ- or STAT6-mediated changes in phagocyte activation were counteracted by changes in IFN-γ-mediated recruitment of permissive CCR2+ monocytes. Monocytes were required for early parasite expansion and acquired an alternatively activated phenotype despite the Th dermal environment required for their recruitment. Surprisingly, STAT6 did not enhance intracellular parasite proliferation, but rather modulated the size and permissiveness of the monocytic host cell reservoir via regulation of IFN-γ and IL-10. These observations expand our understanding of the Th1-Th2 paradigm during infection.",2020-05-13,Cell Host & Microbe,https://openalex.org/V207313999,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.011,752,768.e7,27,5,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016668977,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.011,journal-article,3016668977

In pathological conditions, mitochondrial stress leads to neuronal death, which is regulated by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein localized to mitochondria either in the outer membrane (OM) or inner membrane (Matrix), which have distinct roles in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting bioenergetics, respectively. While the anti-apoptotic role for Mcl1 is well characterized, the protective function of MCL-1 Matrix remains poorly understood. Here, we show MCL-1 OM and MCL-1 Matrix prevent neuronal death through distinct mechanisms. We report that MCL-1 Matrix functions to preserve mitochondrial energy transduction and improves respiratory chain capacity by modulating mitochondrial oxygen consumption in response to mitochondrial stress. We show that MCL-1 Matrix protects neurons from stress by enhancing respiratory function, and by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Taken together, our results provide novel insight into how MCL-1 Matrix may confer neuroprotection under stress conditions involving loss of mitochondrial function.",2020-05-05,Cell Death and Disease,https://openalex.org/V185208586,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2498-9,,,11,5,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022457072,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2498-9,journal-article,3022457072

In nine SCS studies, neurostimulation had positive effects on pain. In three studies, neurostimulation did not significantly reduce pain. For PNS/PNFS, five studies found improvements in pain offered by neurostimulation; pain outcomes were not reported in two studies. In the TENS study, neurostimulation reduced headaches per month and medication consumption. Overall, 2 studies were of low or unclear risk of bias,  were high risk of bias, and the TENS study was not appropriate for assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.A robust body of evidence examining SCS and PNS was identified.

Materials and methods: We studied biomarkers of intestinal permeability in 12 people with MS (57 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 6 progressive MS) and in a group of healthy controls for comparison. Serum/plasma concentrations of zonulin (a regulator of enterocyte tight junctions), tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP)/ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), D-lactate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein were measured. Results: Zonulin concentrations were significantly higher when a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Gad+ RRMS) and were correlated with tight junction proteins. IBABP and D-lactate were elevated in people with RRMS compared to controls, but did not discriminate between Gad+ and Gad– subgroups. Baseline zonulin concentrations were associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS. Conclusions: People with MS have altered biomarkers of intestinal barrier integrity. Zonulin concentrations are associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS and closely mirror BBB breakdown in RRMS. Zonulin may mediate breakdown of both the intestinal barrier and the BBB in gut dysbiosis through the regulation of tight junctions.

We assessed the timing and risk factors associated with readmission to the hospital for VTE among patients with IBD. Methods We collected data from the Nationwide Readmissions Database on IBD index admissions resulting in readmission to the hospital for VTE within 60 days, from 201 through 2014. We used univariable and multivariable regression to assess risk factors associated with VTE readmission with unadjusted risk ratio (RR) and adjusted RR (aRR) as measures of effect. Time to VTE readmission was assessed in 10-day intervals, for up to 9 days. Results We identified 872,122 index admissions of patients with IBD; 116 resulted in readmission with VTE. More than 90% of readmissions occurred within 60 days of discharge from the index admission. Factors associated with hospital readmission with VTE included prior VTE, longer length of hospital stay, comorbidities, having a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy at index admission, and age older than 1 years. Additional risk factors included Clostridium difficile infection at index admission (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.17–1.85) and discharge to a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility (aRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.14-1.70) or discharge with home health services (aRR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.41–1.94). Conclusions Among patients admitted to the hospital with IBD, most readmissions with VTE occur within 60 days of discharge. Readmission with VTE is associated with C difficile infection and discharge to a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or with home health services.

All patient populations were included.Vancomycin AUC:MIC or AUC was related to patient clinical outcome.Searches of medical databases using relevant terms were performed. Screening, study reviewing, data extracting and assessing data quality was performed independently by two reviewers. Studies were stratified by type of primary outcome for calculation of pooled sensitivity, specificity and construction of hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves.Nineteen studies including 169 patients were meta-analysed. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.7 (95% CI 0.67-0.84) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.53-0.71) respectively for the seven studies with primary outcome of mortality and 0.6 (95% CI 0.53-0.75), 0.5 (95% CI 0.48-0.67) for studies with composite or clinical cure outcome (n = 12). HSROC curves suggested considerable heterogeneity. An additional 1 studies were described but could not be included for meta-analysis because data were not available.

Given the important contribution of caregiver emotion socialization, parenting programs targeting these socialization practices represent an effective method of preventative intervention for childhood difficulties with emotion regulation. This review examines emotion socialization parenting programs that target the development of emotion regulation in young children aged 0-6. Through a systematic search of multiple databases, 111 articles were retrieved for title, abstract, and full-text screening. After screening, 1 articles remained and were summarized using a narrative approach. Herein, we provide an overview of  main intervention frameworks: Tuning in to Kids (TIK), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), and Emotion Enhanced Triple P (EETP). Overall, these emotion socialization programs have demonstrated efficacy in their ability to improve parenting behaviors related to the coaching of young children's emotion regulation; however, there has been limited examination of their effectiveness in promoting children's emotion regulation. Future research is required to address this limitation, with rigorous parenting intervention studies incorporating valid assessments of children's emotion regulation in order to promote children's development of adaptive emotion regulation.

Across Central Asia, which is especially vulnerable to climate change due to aridity, the ability of global climate projections to capture the complex dynamics of mountainous environments is particularly limited. Over montane Central Asia, agropastoralism constitutes a major portion of the rural economy. Extensive herbaceous vegetation forms the basis of rural economies in Kyrgyzstan. Here we focus on snow cover seasonality and the effects of terrain on phenology in highland pastures using remote sensing data for 2001–2017. First, we describe the thermal regime of growing season using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, analyzing the modulation by elevation, slope, and aspect. We then characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from modeling the land surface phenology using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series together with MODIS LST data. Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from MODIS snow cover composites—first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates (SCD)—on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height (PH; the maximum modeled NDVI) and thermal time to peak (TTP; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between SCD and PH occurred in over 1664 km2 at p  8% of 68,881 km2 of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and PH, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and PH, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence PH; (3) significant negative correlations between TTP and SCD appeared in 1840 km2 at p",2020-04-01,Remote Sensing of Environment,https://openalex.org/V141808269,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111675,111675,111675,240,,1,25,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004051460,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111675,journal-article,3004051460

The endothelium as a target to reduce diabetes-associated vascular disease,"Over the past 6 years, our knowledge of the role of the endothelium in the regulation of cardiovascular function and dysfunction has advanced from the assumption that it is a single layer of cells that serves as a barrier between the blood stream and vascular smooth muscle to an understanding of its role as an essential endocrine-like organ. In terms of historical contributions, we pay particular credit to (1) the Canadian scientist Dr. Rudolf Altschul who, based on pathological changes in the appearance of the endothelium, advanced the argument in 195 that “one is only as old as one’s endothelium” and (2) the American scientist Dr. Robert Furchgott, a 199 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine, who identified the importance of the endothelium in the regulation of blood flow. This review provides a brief history of how our knowledge of endothelial function has advanced and now recognize that the endothelium produces a plethora of signaling molecules possessing paracrine, autocrine, and, arguably, systemic hormone functions.

It is unclear whether endoscopist feedback on these indicators improves performance. We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether associations exist between endoscopist feedback and colonoscopy performance. Methods We conducted a search through May 201 for studies reporting on endoscopist feedback and associations with ADR or other colonoscopy quality indicators. Pooled rate ratios (RRs) and weighted mean differences were calculated using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were performed to assess for potential methodological or clinical factors associated with outcomes. Results From 132 initial studies, 1 studies were included in the meta-analysis for ADR, representing 33,184 colonoscopies. Endoscopist feedback was associated with an improvement in ADR (RR, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.34). Low performers derived a greater benefit from feedback (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.18-2.23) compared with moderate performers (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.29), whereas high performers did not derive a significant benefit (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.13). Feedback was not associated with increases in withdrawal time (weighted mean difference, +0.43 minutes; 95% CI, −0.50 to +1.36 minutes) or improvements in cecal intubation rate (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01).

Nanoparticles (NPs) have been recently recognized as effective asphaltenes adsorbents and deposition deterrents. The objective of this work is to provide a critical review and highlight the limitations of literature findings on NP use for asphaltenes adsorption and subsequent oxidation. Literature reports showed that asphaltenes uptake by NPs increases with increasing asphaltenes aromaticity and polarity. Moreover, NPs exhibit a higher selectivity to asphaltenes in the presence of other oil constituents such as resins. Composite NPs are superior asphaltenes deposition inhibitors owing to a synergy arising from attaching inorganic NPs to a hydrocarbon. It is worth noting that most of the asphaltenes uptake values were collected from model solutions, and were calculated based on UV–Vis measurements, which have been recently shown not to be very reliable. Acidic NPs and small size NPs are considered better asphaltenes adsorbents, whereas basic NPs and large size NPs are reported as better asphaltenes oxidation promoters. In situ combustion, which is an important enhanced oil recovery method, can be improved in the presence of NPs. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the rapid oxidation of adsorbed asphaltenes; namely mass transfer enhancement and catalytic effect. There is a stronger evidence in support of enhanced asphaltenes exposure to the mass of flowing air. Lastly, the impact of different reservoir conditions on asphaltenes adsorption is presented.

Viscosity reducer (VR) flooding and nitrogen foam flooding are two effective methods of enhancing heavy oil recovery with satisfactory results. In this paper, a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of various factors on the performance of the novel viscosity reducer (VR-A). On this basis, A visualized model was adopted to investigate the synergistic development effect of thermal and chemical flooding, which vividly reflected the interaction of chemical agents with crude oil and their migration characteristics in porous media, as well as the mechanisms of enhancing oil recovery on the pore-scale. The results showed that VR-A could achieve excellent viscosity reduction effect on heavy oil under the influence of various factors, which could be combined with thermal flooding to effectively recover heavy oil. As for the pore-scale level, after the VR-A solution was injected, the interfacial tension between the oil and water was decreased, the wettability of the surface of the particle was changed, and two types of oil-in-water emulsions (spherical emulsions and flocculent emulsions) with a lower viscosity were formed, which were easy to flow with the fluid in pores and throats and could temporarily block the high-permeability area. In the process of foam flooding, the phenomena of bubble coalescence and breakup occurred constantly, and bubbles trapped in the porous media could improve the sweep efficiency of the subsequent fluid. The ultimate oil recovery of the development method combining thermal and chemical flooding in the visualized displacement experiment is 76.9%, 39.7% higher than that of pure thermal flooding.

Here, we show that selective block of Panx1 in single postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons from male rat or mouse brain slices causes intermittent, seconds long increases in the frequency of sEPSC following Schaffer collateral stimulation. The increase in sEPSC frequency occurred without an effect on evoked neurotransmission. Consistent with a presynaptic origin of the augmented glutamate release, the increased sEPSC frequency was prevented by bath-applied EGTA-AM or TTX. Manipulation of a previously described metabotropic NMDAR pathway (i.e., by preventing ligand binding to NMDARs with competitive antagonists or blocking downstream Src kinase) also increased sEPSC frequency similar to that seen when Panx1 was blocked. This facilitated glutamate release was absent in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) KO mice and prevented by the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine, suggesting it required presynaptic TRPV1. We show presynaptic expression of TRPV1 by immunoelectron microscopy and link TRPV1 to Panx1 because Panx1 block increases tissue levels of the endovanilloid, anandamide. Together, these findings demonstrate an unexpected role for metabotropic NMDARs and postsynaptic Panx1 in suppression of facilitated glutamate neurotransmission.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The postsynaptic ion and metabolite channel, pannexin-1, is regulated by metabotropic NMDAR signaling through Src kinase.

There are currently no pediatric ERAS ® Society guidelines. We created an ERAS ® guideline designed to enhance quality of care in neonatal intestinal resection surgery. Methods A multidisciplinary guideline generation group defined the scope, population, and guideline topics. Systematic reviews were supplemented by targeted searching and expert identification to identify 3514 publications that were screened to develop and support recommendations. Final recommendations were determined through consensus and were assessed for evidence quality and recommendation strength. Parental input was attained throughout the process. Results Final recommendations ranged from communication strategies to antibiotic use. Topics with poor-quality and conflicting evidence were eliminated. Several recommendations were combined. The quality of supporting evidence was variable. Seventeen final recommendations are included in the proposed guideline.

Modelling was also conducted on a low-grade X6 steel pipe for comparison. Parametric effects, including internal pressure, R-ratio, cyclic frequency and dimension of the corrosion defect (primarily the defect depth), were determined. The cyclic loading greatly increases the von Mises stress and strain at the corrosion defect and reduces the threshold internal pressure to cause plastic deformation at the defect. As the internal pressure increases, both the von Mises stress and the strain increase and the high stress/strain zones expand along the defect length direction. The local stress and strain at the corrosion defect increase with decreased R-ratio and cyclic frequency, resulting in a reduction of failure pressure of the pipeline. An increased defect depth enhances local stress and strain concentrations, reducing failure pressure of the pipeline. A novel method is developed to assess corrosion defect during ILI tool operation and predict the failure pressure of pipelines under cyclic loading for the first time of its kind.",2020-09-01,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,https://openalex.org/V125705681,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103445,103445,103445,81,,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3037657209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103445,journal-article,3037657209

On the one hand, there are resources perceived as ‘being part of the family in the long run’, and therefore unique and worthy of nurturing. On the other hand, there are resources perceived as ‘with the family only for the short run’, and therefore having commodity-type status and being fungible. The concept of bifurcation bias describes this frequently observed, affect-based phenomenon of separating all resources utilized by the firm into two categories. Bifurcation bias has been argued to be particularly damaging in the context of internationalization, whereby accurate assessment and complex recombination of resources is critical. In this paper, we extend the analysis of bifurcation bias in family firms. We examine how the personal values of family firm owners and non-family members, as well as the dominant cultural values in the relevant, surrounding societies (both home and host), can influence the magnitude and dysfunctional effects of this phenomenon. Infusing values-based analysis into assessing how bifurcation bias plays out in family firms, can improve our understanding of family firm heterogeneity, has implications for empirical research, and may help invalidate some overgeneralized narratives in research on family-firm international behaviour.",2020-06-01,Asia Pacific Journal of Management,https://openalex.org/V107036887,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10490-018-9598-4,449,477,37,2,1,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2948875556,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10490-018-9598-4,journal-article,2948875556

In mixed-use watersheds, elevated nitrogen loads from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent or agricultural runoff often drive the eutrophication of waterways. Accordingly, the objective of this research was to identify sources of riverine nitrate (NO3), a deleterious dissolved species of nitrogen, with a combined isotopic tracing technique in the Bow River and the Oldman River in Alberta, Canada. Riverine NO3 and boron (B) concentrations, mean daily flux and δ15NNO3, δ18ONO3, and δ11B values were determined at 1 mainstem sites during high and low discharge periods in 201 and 2015. The data for mainstem sites were then compared to results for effluent from seven WWTPs, eight synthetic fertilizers, cow manure, and three predominantly agricultural tributary sites to estimate point and non-point NO3 sources. The NO3 flux, δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 values indicated the city of Calgary's Bonnybrook WWTP effluent accounts for the majority of the NO3 flux in the Bow River downstream of Calgary. δ15NNO3 and δ11B values in the Bow River highlighted an increase in agricultural NO3 loading downstream of irrigation return-flows. A three-fold decrease in the NO3:B flux ratio indicated NO3-removal processes are active in the lower reaches of the Bow River. For the Oldman River, δ11B values revealed elevated nutrient loading from the Lethbridge WWTP effluent (10% of downstream B flux). Furthermore, the agricultural tributaries contributed 25% of the local B flux to the Oldman River. Overall, δ11B was proven to be an effective co-tracer for discriminating between urban and agricultural sources of NO3 in these large mixed-use watersheds. This combined isotope tracing approach has significant potential to identify point and non-point NO3 sources driving eutrophication around the world.",2020-02-10,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135043,135043,135043,703,,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989284371,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135043,journal-article,2989284371

In this work, weight-loss testing, electrochemical measurements and surface analysis techniques were used to investigate the pipeline steel corrosion in a Regina clay soil with varied soil layer thicknesses and gassing conditions (i.e., aerobic, CO 2 -containing and anaerobic). Results demonstrate that the steel corrosion is dependent on the soil layer thickness, where a maximum corrosion rate is recorded under the 5 mm thick soil due to the competitive impact of the blocking effect of the soil layer and its moisture-retaining ability on the corrosion. In thin soil layers, the corrosion is accelerated with the increasing soil thickness due to more water contained in the soil. With the further increase of the soil layer thickness, the blocking effect of the soil on diffusion of corrosive species is dominant. The corrosion of the steel also depends heavily on the gassing condition in the soil. Under the specific soil layer thickness, the steel suffers from the highest corrosion rate in aerobic soil, which is followed by the 5% CO 2 /N 2 -containing soil. The steel corrosion is negligible (0.006 mm/y only) when the soil is purged with N 2 . In addition to uniform corrosion, localized corrosion occurs on the steel under soil due to its heterogeneous nature at a much greater rate than the uniform corrosion. The maximum localized corrosion rates in 5% CO 2 /N 2 -containing 5 mm thick soil layer and in the  mm thick soil that is open to air are 1.03 mm/y and 0.7 mm/y, respectively.

Evidence from multiple environmental tracers,"Abstract Characterization of the rainfall infiltration mechanism, whether piston or preferential flow, through an unsaturated zone is necessary for groundwater resource assessment and for analysis of environmental geological hazards. However, several limitations and difficulties remain in determining the infiltration mechanism in arid and semiarid areas. This study combines the evaluations of soil water infiltration characteristics, recharge rate, and determination of groundwater age at a water table in a semiarid loess tableland to examine the recharge processes. The case study is the Xifeng loess tableland in the Loess Plateau of China, which has an unsaturated zone depth of 40–75 m and an obvious 1963-3H peak at a depth of 7.5 m. According to the piston flow, the soil water infiltration velocity is 0.12–0.14 m/yr, corresponding to a recharge rate of 37–41 mm/yr, based on the 1963-3H peak and chloride mass balance method. All of the groundwater from the water table and wells is old (tritium-free), with ages ranging from hundreds of years to 20,000 years, which suggests that no rapid modern recharge has occurred since the 1950s. The chloride content of soil water in the deep unsaturated zone, with an average value of 10.8 mg/L in the unsaturated zone below 30 m, overlaps with that in groundwater, at 4.0–10.9 mg/L. The comprehensive isotopic and chemical compositions for soil water and groundwater showed that piston flow was dominant during soil water infiltration at the field scale, resulting in the delay of modern water and related solutes entering the groundwater. Combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers, such as Cl, Br, 2H, 18O, 13C, 3H and 14C, can be regarded as a generic framework for studying the recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales.",2020-04-01,Journal of Hydrology,https://openalex.org/V55737203,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124532,124532,124532,583,,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997829865,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124532,journal-article,2997829865

Until now, the primary antiviral function of IFN-λs has been proposed to be at anatomical barrier sites. Here, we examine the regulation of IFN-λR1 expression and measure the downstream effects of IFN-λ3 stimulation in primary human blood immune cells, compared with lung or liver epithelial cells. IFN-λ3 directly bound and upregulated IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in freshly purified human B cells and CD8+ T cells, but not monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and CD4+ T cells. Despite similar IFNLR1 transcript levels in B cells and lung epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells bound more IFN-λ3, which resulted in a 50-fold greater ISG induction when compared to B cells. The reduced response of B cells could be explained by higher expression of the soluble variant of IFN-λR1 (sIFN-λR1), which significantly reduced ISG induction when added with IFN-λ3 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or liver epithelial cells. T-cell receptor stimulation potently, and specifically, upregulated membrane-bound IFNLR1 expression in CD4+ T cells, leading to greater antiviral gene induction, and inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.

This study demonstrates that we can tune MWCNT dispersion, nano localization, electrical conductivity, EMI SE and rheological properties of PS/PVDF/MWCNT nanocomposites by manipulating the mixing order of blend components. Premixing MWCNT with PS phase of PS/PVDF (50:50) blend reduces the agglomeration of MWCNT by 6% (via optical micrograph analysis), compared to the one-step mixing technique. Transmission electron microscope images of PS/PVDF blend nanocomposite show that MWCNT is located in the phase with which MWCNT is premixed. However, for the one-step mixing technique, the MWCNT mostly locates in PVDF with some agglomerates in PS phase.

With the global obesity epidemic, almost  in  patients with IBD are obese. Obesity is associated with greater difficulty in achieving remission, higher risk of disease relapse and higher burden and costs of hospitalization in patients with IBD. Obese patients also have inferior response to biologic therapy related to altered pharmacokinetics and obesity-mediated chronic inflammation. Surgical management of obese patients with IBD is also challenging. Similar to obesity, the prevalence of IBD in older patients is rising and it is anticipated that almost one-third of patients with IBD will be older than 6 years within the next decade. Older patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and management of these individuals warrants careful consideration of the risks of disease-related versus treatment-related complications, non-IBD-related extra-intestinal complications (eg, cardiovascular disease, malignancy), in the context of individual values, preferences, functional status and comorbidities. With evolving therapeutics, medical management of IBD surrounding pregnancy continues to be challenging. Overall, the management of pregnant patients requires a pro-active, multidisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on optimal disease control not just during, but prior to pregnancy. This often involves continuation of highly effective therapies, of which the vast majority are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, resulting in a reduction of risk of adverse maternal fetal outcomes.",2020-05-01,Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology,https://openalex.org/V6642600,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2019.11.009,1367,1380,18,6,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985969672,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2019.11.009,journal-article,2985969672

To better understand the complex thermal energy and water transport mechanisms involved, the influence of antecedent moisture content and macroporosity on infiltration into frozen soil was investigated. Ponded infiltration experiments on frozen macroporous and non‐macroporous soil columns revealed that dry macroporous soil produced infiltration rates reaching 10³ to 10⁴ mm day⁻¹, two to three orders of magnitude larger than dry non‐macroporous soil. Results suggest that rapid infiltration and drainage were a result of preferential flow through initially air‐filled macropores. Using recorded flow rates and measured macropore characteristics, calculations indicated that a combination of both saturated flow and unsaturated film flow likely occurred within macropores. Under wet conditions, regardless of the presence of macropores, infiltration was restricted by the slow thawing rate of pore ice, producing infiltration rates of 2.8 to 5.0 mm day⁻¹. Reduced preferential flow under wet conditions was attributed to a combination of soil swelling, due to smectite‐rich clay (that reduced macropore volume), and pore ice blockage within macropores. In comparison, dry soil column experiments demonstrated that macropores provided conduits for water and thermal energy to bypass the frozen matrix during infiltration, reducing thaw rates compared with non‐macroporous soils. Overall, results showed the dominant control of antecedent moisture content on the initiation, timing, and magnitude of infiltration and flow in frozen macroporous soils, as well as the important role of macropore connectivity. The study provides an important data set that can aid the development of hydrological models that consider the interacting effects of soil freeze–thaw and preferential flow on snowmelt partitioning in cold regions.",2020-01-30,Hydrological Processes,https://openalex.org/V75830442,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13629,795,809,34,3,0,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985983213,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13629,journal-article,2985983213

Our primary aim was to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between pharmacological cardioversion followed by electrical cardioversion (drug–shock), and electrical cardioversion alone (shock-only). Our secondary aim was to compare the effectiveness of two pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Methods We did a partial factorial trial of two protocols for patients with acute atrial fibrillation at 1 academic hospital emergency departments in Canada. We enrolled adult patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Protocol 1 was a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled comparison of attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide (1 mg/kg over 30 min) followed by electrical cardioversion if necessary (up to three shocks, each of ≥200 J), and placebo infusion followed by electrical cardioversion. For patients having electrical cardioversion, we used Protocol 2, a randomised, open-label, nested comparison of anteroposterior versus anterolateral pad positions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by study site) for Protocol 1 by on-site research personnel using an online electronic data capture system. Randomisation for Protocol 2 occurred 30 min after drug infusion for patients who had not converted and was stratified by site and Protocol 1 allocation. Patients and all research and emergency department staff were masked to treatment allocation for Protocol 1. The primary outcome was conversion to normal sinus rhythm for at least 30 min at any time after randomisation and up to a point immediately after three shocks. Protocol 1 was analysed by intention to treat and Protocol  excluded patients who did not receive electrical cardioversion. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891058. Findings Between July 18, 2013, and Oct 17, 2018, we enrolled 3 patients, and none were lost to follow-up. In the drug–shock group (n=204), conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 1 (96%) patients and in the shock-only group (n=192), conversion occurred in 1 (92%) patients (absolute difference 4%; 95% CI 0–9; p=0·07). The proportion of patients discharged home was 97% (n=198) versus 95% (n=183; p=0·60). 1 (52%) patients in the drug–shock group converted after drug infusion only. No patients had serious adverse events in follow-up. The different pad positions in Protocol  (n=244), had similar conversions to sinus rhythm (11 [94%] of 1 in anterolateral group vs 1 [92%] of 1 in anteroposterior group; p=0·68). Interpretation Both the drug–shock and shock-only strategies were highly effective, rapid, and safe in restoring sinus rhythm for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation, avoiding the need for return to hospital. The drug infusion worked for about half of patients and avoided the resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion. We also found no significant difference between the anterolateral and anteroposterior pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Immediate rhythm control for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation leads to excellent outcomes.

Calcium looping process has not yet been commercialized due to challenges associated with the activity loss of CaO sorbents resulting from sintering of the particles in cyclic operations. In the present study, zirconia-stabilized calcium oxide sorbents have been developed through the solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. The effects of preparation conditions (percentage of Zr stabilizer and fuel-to-metal oxide ratio) on the CO 2 capture performance were investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Sorbents with 20% calcium zirconate stabilizer and high fuel-to-metal oxide ratio exhibited an optimal combination of CO 2 uptake capacity and stability. Increasing the fuel ratio improved the CO 2 uptake capacity due to higher surface area and smaller particle size of the synthesized sorbents. However, increasing the ratio beyond six did not have any significant impact on the performance of the sorbent. Based on the results, the optimum fuel-to-metal oxide ratio for synthesis was six times the stoichiometric ratio. Two sorbents showing the best results (S20-4x and S20-6x) were tested in 50-cycle experiments under mild and harsh calcination conditions for long-term stability assessment. Sorbents displayed high uptake capacity (7.7 and 8.8 mol/kg, respectively, under mild conditions; and 5.0 and 6.5 mol/kg respectively, under harsh conditions) after 5 cycles, which is a significant improvement over the uptake of the benchmark limestone (4.1 and 1.7 mol/kg under mild and harsh conditions, respectively).

Having data on the burden of pediatric pertussis in a large population over time is important for establishing the true burden of disease in the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine era. Here, we describe age-specific epidemiology and morbidity and mortality rates in children hospitalized with pertussis over 1 years across Canada in the aP vaccine era. Methods Patients aged ≤16 years who were admitted to  of 1 pediatric tertiary-care hospitals across Canada between 199 and 201 with confirmed (laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked) or probable (clinically diagnosed) pertussis were included. Results Overall, 140 patients with pertussis were included. Infants aged &amp;lt;2 months had the highest mean annual incidences of pertussis hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (116.40 [95% confidence interval (CI), 85.32–147.49] and 33.48 [95% CI, 26.35–40.62] per 10 00 population, respectively). The overall proportion of children who required ICU admission was 25.46%, and the proportion was highest in infants aged &amp;lt;2 months (37.90%). Over the span of this study, 2 deaths occurred. Age of &amp;lt;1 weeks, prematurity, encephalopathy, and a confirmed pertussis diagnosis were independent risk factors for ICU admission.

To recommend profitable driving routes to taxi drivers, ASER takes the load balance between passengers and taxis into consideration and the shortest expected cruising distance is introduced to formulate potential cruising distance of taxis. Moreover, MapReduce and a novel data structure kdS-tree are applied to improve recommendation efficiency.

Panx1 permeability is often inferred from channel permeability to fluorescent dyes, but it is currently unknown whether dye permeability translates to permeability to other molecules. Cell shrinkage and C-terminal cleavage led to a Panx1 open-state with increased permeability to atomic ions (current), but did not alter ethidium uptake. Panx1 inhibitors affected Panx1-mediated ion conduction differently from ethidium permeability, and inhibitor efficiency towards a given molecule therefore cannot be extrapolated to its effects on the permeability of another. We conclude that ethidium permeability does not reflect equal permeation of other molecules and thus is no measure of general Panx1 activity. ABSTRACT Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a large-pore membrane channel connecting the extracellular milieu with the cell interior. While several activation regimes activate Panx1 in a variety of cell types, the selective permeability of an open Panx1 channel remains unresolved: does a given activation paradigm increase Panx1's permeability towards all permeants equally and does fluorescent dye flux serve as a proxy for biological permeation through an open channel? To explore permeant-selectivity of Panx1 activation and inhibition, we employed Panx1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293T cells. We report that different mechanisms of activation of Panx1 differentially affected ethidium and atomic ion permeation. Most notably, C-terminal truncation or cell shrinkage elevated Panx1-mediated ion conductance, but had no effect on ethidium permeability. In contrast, extracellular pH changes predominantly affected ethidium permeability but not ionic conductance. High [K+ ]o did not increase the flux of either of the two permeants. Once open, Panx1 demonstrated preference for anionic permeants, such as Cl- , lactate and glutamate, while not supporting osmotic water flow. Panx1 inhibitors displayed enhanced potency towards Panx1-mediated currents compared to that of ethidium uptake. We conclude that activation or inhibition of Panx1 display permeant-selectivity and that permeation of ethidium does not necessarily reflect an equal permeation of smaller biological molecules and atomic ions.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278759,361,379,598,2,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983139909,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278759,journal-article,2983139909

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent infection-induced coagulopathy and associated tissue damage. Using intravital microscopy, we found that Staphylococcus aureus infection induced neutrophil recruitment, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release in the liver. Mice pretreated with ASA, or animals receiving ASA 3 hours postinfection, had significantly reduced platelet aggregation and NET release. Additionally, ASA-treated mice had reduced intravascular thrombin activity and microvascular occlusion as compared with untreated S aureus–infected mice. This inhibition of coagulation was accompanied by decreased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma, indicating less liver damage. Finally, bacterial loads (colony-forming units per milliliter) in liver, lung, and spleen were not different between groups, and the phagocytic capacity of Kupffer cells was preserved following ASA treatment.

This paper details experiments performed in shale particle immersion and core plug imbibition, and it investigates changes in fluid properties during a shale well shut-in period at the Longmaxi formation in Southeast Chongqing, China. The results indicate that soluble salts in a shale formation are dissolved during fracturing fluid retention in a shale reservoir, causing the salinity and pH of the fracturing fluid to increase significantly and eventually resulting in the formation of a weakly alkaline solution. Furthermore, fracturing fluid retention significantly reduces the mechanical strength of shale. In the experiments, the elasticity modulus and Poisson's ratio of the shale decreased by 85% and 54%, respectively, which was immersed in the fracturing fluid for seven days. Two types of forces, repulsive hydration and electric double-layer repulsion, are shown to be the main factors that lead to the formation of a large number of microcracks. The repulsive hydration pressure force is in a short range, operating over only a few nanometers, while the electric double-layer repulsion force operates over a long distance and can act between clay mineral slices. As the concentration of the solution increases, the double-layer repulsive force increases, though the range over which it acts becomes shorter. The increase in the OH− concentration of the solution also accelerates crack propagation. These conclusions are conducive to developing reasonable rules for fracturing fluid flowback in shale gas wells.",2020-03-01,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,https://openalex.org/V125705681,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103163,103163,103163,75,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000577453,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103163,journal-article,3000577453

This study developed an innovative process to produce methanol by combining water electrolysis with tri-reforming of methane (TRM). The proposed design utilized carbon-free electricity to split water into O2 and H2; O2 is collected for partial oxidation reaction in the TRM and H2 is collected for stoichiometric number (SN) optimization. This process configuration eliminates the typical problems of H2 surplus or deficit associated with methanol synthesis and allows a substantial amount of CO2 to be converted. The main process flowsheet was developed with Aspen HYSYS process simulator and then the feasibility of this project was evaluated based on its technical, environmental, and economic performances. The estimated capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenditure (OPEX) and GHG emissions of the baseline plant are US$77 million, US$26 million/yr. and −0.14 kgCO2eq/kgMeOH, respectively. In particular, water electrolysis process accounted for 3 % of CAPEX and 5 % of OPEX. A discounted cash flow (DCF) model combined with sensitivity analyses showed that a breakeven point could be reached with a methanol price of US$491/ton.

However, the final properties of MWCNT-based nanocomposites greatly depend on the quality of MWCNT dispersion, and hence on the mixing technique. In the current work, for the first time, we show the effect of different mixing methods on nonlinear viscoelastic response and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of MWCNT/polymer nanocomposites. To do this, MWCNT/poly(styrene) (PS) nanocomposites were prepared by two frequently-used approaches, namely, melt mixing and solution mixing. Nonlinear rheological response of the samples reveals higher intra-cycle and inter-cycle viscoelastic nonlinearity for solution-mixed samples. Imaging analysis of the solution-mixed sample showed heterogeneous dispersion with highly interconnected networks of MWCNT in PS matrix. The interconnected network of MWCNT developed by solution mixing leads to significantly enhanced EMI shielding performance over melt-mixed nanocomposites containing big clusters of MWCNT in micro-scale but smaller agglomerates in nano-scale. Hence, an optimum state of dispersion (i.e., heterogeneous dispersion or small agglomerates connected with individual MWCNT) of MWCNT is necessary to achieve maximum EMI shielding performance.",2020-09-01,Materials today communications,https://openalex.org/V2765035490,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101010,101010,101010,24,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007985275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101010,journal-article,3007985275

However, the mechanism by which insecure attachment leads to addictive behaviors remains largely unknown. In the present research we tested whether emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between insecure attachment (anxious, avoidant) in substance use (alcohol, marijuana) and DSM-5 (Internet gaming) and non-DSM-5 (texting) behavioral dependencies. A sample (N = 712) of participants recruited from a university in the United States completed an online battery of instruments, assessing adult attachment style, emotion dysregulation, and self-reported DSM-5 symptoms adapted from substance use disorder criteria. In separate mediation analyses, anxious attachment was associated with self-reported DSM-5 symptoms for alcohol, marijuana, texting, but not Internet gaming; whereas emotion dysregulation was associated with self-reported DSM-5 symptoms of all four potentially addictive behaviors. Avoidant attachment was not associated with self-reported DSM-5 symptoms for any of the addictive behaviors. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between both anxious and avoidant attachment and self-reported DSM-5 symptoms for alcohol, marijuana, and texting. In contrast, emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between anxious but not avoidant attachment and Internet gaming. Insecure attachment, specifically anxious attachment and emotion dysregulation may be important psychological characteristics that increase the risk for alcohol, marijuana and texting, while Internet gaming corresponds with unique characteristics. Whereas attachment styles may be resistant to change, emotion dysregulation has been found to be modifiable and may provide a potential target in the treatment of substance use disorders and some behavioral dependencies for those who manifest attachment insecurities.",2020-08-01,Addictive Behaviors,https://openalex.org/V186215666,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106432,106432,106432,107,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014885313,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106432,journal-article,3014885313

The widening gap between the labour force participation of persons with versus without disability has been an enduring concern for many governments across the globe, which has led to policy initiatives such as labour market activation programs, welfare reforms, and equality laws. Despite these policies, persistently poor labour force participation rates for persons with developmental disabilities suggest that this population experiences pervasive barriers to participating in the labour force.Materials and methods: In this study, a two-phase qualitative research design was used to systematically identify, explore and prioritize barriers to employment for persons with developmental disabilities, potential policy solutions and criteria for evaluating future policy initiatives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives, a Nominal Group Technique and a modified Delphi technique were used to collect and analyze data.Results: Findings indicate that barriers to employment for persons with developmental disabilities are multi-factorial and policy solutions to address these barriers require stakeholder engagement and collaboration from multiple sectors.Conclusions: Individual, environmental and societal factors all impact employment outcomes for persons with developmental disabilities.

By using stereology and expression of cell cycle markers, we found that the placenta grows under normal conditions not just by hyperplasia of trophoblast cells but also through extensive polyploidy and cell hypertrophy. In response to feeding a low protein diet to mothers prior to and during pregnancy, to mimic chronic malnutrition, we found that this normal program was altered and that it was influenced by the sex of the conceptus. Male fetuses showed intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by embryonic day (E) 18.5, just before term, whereas female fetuses showed IUGR as early as E16.5. This difference was correlated with differences in the size of the labyrinth layer of the placenta, the site of nutrient and gas exchange. Functional changes were implied based on up-regulation of nutrient transporter genes. The junctional zone was also affected, with a reduction in both glycogen trophoblast and spongiotrophoblast cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of Phlda2 and reduced expression of Egfr. Polyploidy, which results from endoreduplication, is a normal feature of trophoblast giant cells (TGC) but also spongiotrophoblast cells. Ploidy was increased in sinusoidal-TGCs and spongiotrophoblast cells, but not parietal-TGCs, in low protein placentas.

We have shown that pMHCII-based nanomedicines displaying liver autoimmune disease-relevant yet ubiquitously expressed antigens can blunt various liver autoimmune disorders in a non-disease-specific manner without suppressing local or systemic immunity against infectious agents or cancer. Here, we show that such ubiquitous autoantigen-specific T cells are also awakened by extrahepatic tissue damage and that the corresponding TR1 progeny can suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and pancreatic β cell autoreactivity. In mice having EAE, nanomedicines displaying either ubiquitous or CNS-specific epitopes triggered the formation and expansion of cognate TR1 cells and their recruitment to the CNS-draining lymph nodes, sparing their liver-draining counterparts. Surprisingly, in mice having both liver autoimmunity and EAE, liver inflammation sequestered these ubiquitous or even CNS-specific TR1 cells away from the CNS, abrogating their antiencephalitogenic activity. In these mice, only the ubiquitous antigen-specific TR1 cells suppressed liver autoimmunity. Thus, the scope of antigen spreading in autoimmune disorders is larger than previously anticipated, involving specificities expected to be silenced by mechanisms of tolerance; the regulatory activity, but not the retention of autoreactive TR1 cells, requires local autoantigen expression.",2020-04-01,Journal of Clinical Investigation,https://openalex.org/V114430552,American Society for Clinical Investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci130670,1823,1829,130,4,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009853057,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci130670,journal-article,3009853057

Hair follicles chemotactically attract macrophages and T cells so that they are in range to regulate epithelial stem cell quiescence, proliferation and differentiation during physiologic and injured states. Disruption of this dynamic relationship leads to clinically significant forms of hair loss including scarring and non-scarring alopecias. In this review, we summarize key concepts behind immune-mediated hair regeneration, highlight gaps in the literature and discuss the therapeutic potential of exploiting this relationship for treating various immune-mediated alopecias.",2020-05-11,npj Regenerative Medicine,https://openalex.org/V2736947229,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41536-020-0095-2,,,5,1,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022261812,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41536-020-0095-2,journal-article,3022261812

The bulk and interfacial rheological parameters can be tuned by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) featuring different surface chemistries and polymers with different chemical or physical structures. Therefore, NPs and polymers can be used to formulate emulsions with different properties.The viscoelasticity at the oil-(aqueous phase) interface and the bulk viscoelasticity of aqueous phase were investigated in the presence of different fumed silica NPs (i.e., hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and slightly hydrophobic) and polymers with two different molecular weights. Bulk and interfacial viscoelastic properties were investigated, employing oscillatory rheological techniques. Furthermore, morphology and stability of the oil-in-(aqueous nanofluid) emulsions were explored utilizing bulk emulsification and single drop coalescence experiments.Introducing polymers into the aqueous nanofluids had opposite effects on bulk and interfacial viscoelasticity. Despite the significant increase in bulk viscoelasticity upon addition of polymers into the aqueous nanofluids, the interfacial viscoelasticity and emulsion stability considerably decreased. The slightly hydrophobic NP nanofluids without polymers showed no bulk viscoelasticity, but displayed the highest interfacial viscoelasticity and emulsion stability. This provided us a unique opportunity to unravel the importance of bulk and interfacial viscoelasticity on oil-in-water emulsification and proved the dominant role of interfacial viscoelasticity over bulk viscoelasticity on emulsion stability.",2020-09-15,Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,https://openalex.org/V204609040,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.105,252,263,576,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023750379,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.105,journal-article,3023750379

Recent studies have implicated the loss of constitutively expressed switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex subunits in undifferentiated carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and other sites. In this study we examine the expression of SWI/SNF and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in a series of undifferentiated carcinomas from the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas. Methods and results We searched pathology databases from four Canadian health centres for primary undifferentiated carcinoma from gastrointestinal and pancreatic resection specimens. Upon review of 3 cases, 19 were confirmed to be undifferentiated carcinomas (eight colonic, six gastric, three pancreatic, one appendiceal and one duodenal). Immunohistochemical analysis of SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCB1, ARID1A, ARID1B, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 was performed on whole sections. Five of 19 (26%) showed loss of core SWI/SNF proteins (two loss of SMARCA4, one loss of SMARCB1 and two concurrent loss of ARID1A and ARID1B). SMARCA4, SMARCB1, or ARID1A/ARID1B-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma consistently exhibited sheet-like growth pattern, with cellular discohesion and rhabdoid morphology. Nine of 1 undifferentiated carcinomas tested were MMR-deficient by immunohistochemistry. In comparison, none of the 1 poorly differentiated carcinomas that were originally diagnosed as undifferentiated carcinomas showed loss of SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCB1 or ARID1B. Conclusions Undifferentiated gastrointestinal/pancreatic carcinomas show frequent loss of expression of SWI/SNF complex proteins. The loss of these core components of SWI/SNF complex may contribute to the arrest of cellular differentiation, resulting in the undifferentiated histology and aggressive clinical behaviour.",2020-07-01,Histopathology,https://openalex.org/V14376486,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14096,,,,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3025067441,https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14096,journal-article,3025067441

The unit energy consumption of forging production equipment is significantly higher than that of other general manufacturing equipment. Employing efficient and energy-saving scheduling methods can significantly reduce the energy consumption in forging production. However, the relationship between heating furnace and other equipment in forging production is complicated, resulting in few studies on energy-saving scheduling problem for forging production line. Thus, the energy-efficient hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with forging operations (EHFSP-FO) was investigated in this research. First, the production mode considering multiple time factors and mixed production was established. The mixed production mode consisted of continuous processing with variable parameters and intermittent processing. Then, a novel mathematical model considering makespan and energy consumption was constructed based on the mixed production mode for the proposed problem, and a new rule to identify the optimum transportation sequence and time was formulated. Furthermore, the population and major operators were designed and applied to an evolutionary algorithm by weighted sum approach. The scheduling results were achieved based on the real-world process data for different types of ring forgings to verify the feasibility of the established mathematical model. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed mathematical model can be used to identify the optimal schedule considering makespan and energy consumption simultaneously.",2020-02-10,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119071,119071,119071,246,,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985237577,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119071,journal-article,2985237577

Although it might appear relatively straightforward to magnetically or electrically stimulate at different levels (cortical/spinal/muscle) and to measure mechanical and electromyographic responses to quantify neuromuscular adjustments due to sustained/repeated muscle contractions, there are drawbacks that researchers and clinicians need to bear in mind. The aim of this opinion paper is to highlight the pitfalls inevitably faced when NMF is quantified. The first problem might arise from the definition of fatigue itself and the parameter(s) used to measure it; for instance, measuring power vs. isometric torque may lead to different conclusions. Another potential limitation is the delay between exercise termination and the evaluation of neuromuscular function; the possible underestimation of exercise-induced neural and contractile impairment and misinterpretation of fatigue etiology will be discussed, as well as solutions recently proposed to overcome this problem. Quantification of NMF can also be biased (or not feasible) because of the techniques themselves (e.g. results may depend on stimulation intensity for transcranial magnetic stimulation) or the way data are analyzed (e.g. M wave peak-to-peak vs first phase amplitude). When available, alternatives recently suggested in the literature to overcome these pitfalls are considered and recommendations about the best practices to assess NMF (e.g. paying attention to the delay between exercise and testing, adapting the method to the characteristics of the population to be tested and considering the limitations associated with the techniques) are proposed.",2020-03-01,Sports Medicine,https://openalex.org/V137994755,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01203-9,439,447,50,3,0,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985621382,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-019-01203-9,journal-article,2985621382

Inhibitory neural feedback associated with activation of mechano- and metabo-sensitive muscle afferents has been implicated in this phenomenon. The present study aimed to quantify and compare the effects of pre-induced fatigue and concurrent rising pain (evoked by muscle ischaemia) on the contralateral leg exercise capacity, neuromuscular performance, and corticomotor excitability and inhibition of knee extensor muscles. Pre-induced fatigue in one leg had a greater detrimental effect than the concurrent rising pain on the contralateral limb cycling capacity. Furthermore, pre-induced fatigue, but not concurrent rising pain, reduced corticospinal inhibition recorded from tested contralateral muscles. Regardless of the origin or mechanisms modulating sensory afferents during single-leg cycling exercise (i.e. pre-induced fatigue vs. concurrent rising pain), the limit of exercise tolerance remained the same and exercise was terminated upon achievement of a sensory tolerance limit. ABSTRACT Individuals often need to maintain voluntary contractions during high intensity exercise in the presence of fatigue and pain. This investigation examined the effects of pre-induced fatigue and concurrent rising pain (evoked by muscle ischaemia) in one leg on motor fatigability and corticospinal excitability/inhibition of the contralateral limb. Twelve healthy males undertook four experimental protocols including unilateral cycling to task failure at 80% of peak power output with: (i) the right-leg (RL); (ii) the left-leg (LL); (iii) RL immediately preceded by LL protocol (FAT-RL); and (iv) RL when blood flow was occluded in the contralateral (left) leg (PAIN-RL). Participants performed maximal and submaximal 5 s right-leg knee extensions during which transcranial magnetic and femoral nerve electrical stimuli were delivered to elicit motor-evoked and compound muscle action potentials, respectively. The pre-induced fatigue reduced the right leg cycling time-to-task failure (mean ± SD; 332 ± 137 s) to a greater extent than concurrent pain (460 ± 158 s), compared to RL (580 ± 226 s) (P < 0.001). The maximum voluntary contraction force declined less following FAT-RL (P < 0.019) and PAIN-RL (P < 0.032) compared to RL. Voluntary activation declined and the corticospinal excitability recorded from knee extensors increased similarly after the three conditions (P < 0.05). However, the pre-induced fatigue, but not concurrent pain, reduced corticospinal inhibition compared to RL (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that regardless of the origin and/or mechanisms modulating sensory afferent feedback during single-leg cycling (e.g. pre-induced fatigue vs. concurrent rising pain), the limit of exercise tolerance remains the same, suggesting that exercise will be terminated upon achievement of sensory tolerance limit.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278943,285,302,598,2,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996097502,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp278943,journal-article,2996097502

The three main components of such a system—hydrogels, cells, and device configurations—are examined thoroughly. First, the characteristics of various types of hydrogels including natural and synthetic types, especially concerning cell encapsulation, are examined. This is followed by the elucidation of the reasoning behind choosing specific cells for encapsulation. Next, in addition to a detailed discussion of their respective droplet formation mechanisms, various device configurations including T-junctions, flow-focusing, and co-flowing that aid in achieving cell encapsulation are critically reviewed.

The only available 2 treatment options are intravenous alteplase and endovascular therapy (mechanical clot removal), both of which are highly time-dependent. Thus, rapid patient transfer, diagnosis, and treatment are crucial, and time-consuming imaging methods and overly selective treatment selection criteria should be avoided. A combined endovascular therapy approach using stent-retrievers and aspiration is the most effective way to achieve fast first-pass complete reperfusion and should thus be used. To diagnose and treat patients as fast as possible, the organization of existing systems of care, and particularly pre-hospital transfer systems, have to be changed. Several different transport models are currently in use because the optimal patient transfer paradigm is highly dependent on local geography and hospital efficiency. • Acute ischemic stroke due to LVO is a severely disabling disease. Intravenous alteplase and endovascular therapy are the only 2 available treatment options. • Because the treatment effect is highly time-dependent and the natural course of the disease is poor, treatment delays and patient overselection for treatment should be avoided. • Outcomes are directly related to quality of reperfusion.

These short cationic peptides are bactericidal against both Gram-positive and -negative enteric pathogens, but may also exert killing effects on intestinal luminal microbiota. Simultaneously, these peptides modulate numerous cellular responses crucial for gut defenses, including leukocyte chemotaxis and migration, wound healing, cytokine production, cell proliferation, and pathogen sensing.

In a theoretical framework where these peptides work synergistically, aspects of pathogenesis of infectious colitis reviewed herein uncover roles of host defense peptides aimed to promote epithelial defenses and prevent pathogen colonization, mediated through a combination of direct antimicrobial function and fine-tuning of host immune response and inflammation. This interactive host defense peptide network may decode how the intestinal immune system functions to quickly clear infections, restore homeostasis and avoid damaging inflammation associated with pathogen persistence during infectious colitis.

Scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy and Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy were conducted, and the effects of the initial concentration of crude oil, contact time, solution pH, ionic strength, and temperature were examined to understand the adsorption mechanism. Our results revealed that the Temkin model and pseudo–first–order model fit the adsorption data for crude oil on the PTFE membrane well, with R2 values of >0.98. The adsorption behavior was physical, as indicated by the value of the heat of adsorption BT (0.028 kJ/mol) and Δ r H m θ (–16.24 kJ/mol). Moreover, the values of Δ r G m θ (4.21–6.31 kJ/mol), Δ r H m θ (–16.24 kJ/mol), and Δ r S m θ (–0.06981 kJ/(mol·K)) indicated that the adsorption followed a spontaneous, exothermic, and less random process. Furthermore, the adsorption fouling was mitigated by slowing down the diffusion rate, decreasing the initial concentration of crude oil, reducing the adsorption time, increasing the solution temperature, and maintaining a pH value between 4.0 and 10.0. These results provide theoretical support for mitigating the adsorption fouling of the PTFE membrane during oily wastewater treatment.",2020-03-18,Separation and Purification Technology,https://openalex.org/V69753523,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2019.116212,116212,116212,235,,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979306278,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2019.116212,journal-article,2979306278

What are the effects of the menstrual (early follicular and mid-luteal) or monophasic oral contraceptive (inactive- and active-pill) cycle phases on vascular reperfusion of lower limb microvasculature in healthy, active women using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) vascular occlusion test (VOT) technique? What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrated that vascular responsiveness in the lower limb microvasculature remained unchanged between the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and inactive- and active-pill phases of the oral contraceptive cycle. These data support that controlling for the cycle phases, within the specific times evaluated in this study, might not be necessary when assessing NIRS-VOT reperfusion rates. Abstract The objective was to examine whether the menstrual or monophasic oral contraceptive cycle phases affect microvascular responsiveness of the lower limb in healthy, active women. During the follicular or inactive-pill phase and the luteal or active-pill phase of the menstrual or oral contraceptive cycle, respectively, 15 non-oral contraceptive users (mean ± SD; 2 ±  years of age) and 15 monophasic oral contraceptive users (2 ±  years of age) underwent a lower-limb vascular occlusion test ( min baseline,  min occlusion and  min post cuff release). Menstrual cycle phases were verified using an ovulation test. Vascular responsiveness was assessed by calculating the near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygen saturation (StO2 ) reperfusion slope (slope 2 StO2 ) and the post occlusion StO2 area under the curve (StO2AUC ) of the tibialis anterior muscle. There were no differences in the reperfusion slope (as a percentage per second; follicular, 1.1 ± 0.48; luteal, 1.0 ± 0.48, inactive-pill, 0.9 ± 0.23; and active-pill, 0.8 ± 0.36; P = 0.09) and area under the curve (as a product of the percentage and seconds; follicular, 10 ± 562; luteal, 9 ± 414, inactive-pill, 9 ± 702; and active-pill, 7 ± 519; P = 0.09) between the phases of the menstrual or oral contraceptive cycle, regardless of pill generation. The duration of oral contraceptive use was not associated with changes in slope 2 StO2 (r = 0.02, P = 0.94) or StO2AUC (r = -0.34, P = 0.22) between cycle phases. In conclusion, vascular responsiveness remained unchanged between the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and the inactive-pill and active-pill phases of the oral contraceptive cycle.",2020-01-01,Experimental Physiology,https://openalex.org/V65894173,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088135,184,191,105,1,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980599706,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep088135,journal-article,2980599706

It is generally accepted that theories explaining water flooding performance in light oil reservoirs are not applicable to heavy oil reservoirs. Nonetheless, there is a lack of a systematic study discussing the underlying mechanisms of water flooding in heavy oil systems. This article presents findings of water flooding experiments and discusses the interplay between viscous and capillary forces as a function of oil viscosity and injection velocity. Experimental data of 178 core floods were used to develop a new dimensionless capillary number, N C a = ( μ w V w σ C o s θ φ ) 0.2 ( μ w μ o ) 0.5 ( K L D ) 0.1 , which is useful in predicting water flood performance for a wide range of oil to water viscosity ratio up to 15,000. This scaling parameter along with the Peters and Flock's (Peters and Flock, 1981) instability number were used to map the interplay between capillary and viscous forces. It was found that there is a critical oil to water viscosity ratio (≤20) below which the flow is stable (having instability numbers below a critical value) and viscous-dominant. In these cases, breakthrough oil recovery monotonically increases with increasing injection velocity. For viscous oils with viscosity of greater than 160 mPa s, flow is identified as pseudo-stable flow with instability numbers above a critical instability number. In these cases, breakthrough oil recovery is almost independent of injection velocity. In intermediate oil to water viscosity ratio of 20–160, breakthrough oil recovery increases with decreasing injection velocity, suggesting the flow regime is capillary-dominant. In these cases, imbibition activated at slower velocities has been identified as the main mechanism responsible for incremental oil recovery.

This article focuses on the mediating role of feelings of violation (a mixture of negative emotions) in the relationship between psychological contract breach and CWB, and assesses whether volunteers and paid employees experience a similar chain of events. The study uses Mplus 7 to estimate a moderated mediation model with bootstrapping. The results indicate that both paid employees and volunteers (1) experience feelings of violation when perceiving psychological contract breach, and (2) engage in CWB targeted to the organization (CWB-O) when experiencing feelings of violation. However, these relationships were not significantly different when comparing paid employees and volunteers.

To create these patterns plants must control the divergence angle between the appearance of successive organs, sometimes to within a fraction of a degree. The most common angle is the Fibonacci or golden angle, and its prevalence has led to the hypothesis that it has been selected by evolution as optimal for plants with respect to some fitness benefits, such as light capture. We explore arguments for and against this idea with computer models. We have used both idealized and scanned leaves from Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta to measure the overlapping leaf area of simulated plants after varying parameters such as leaf shape, incident light angles, and other leaf traits. We find that other angles generated by Fibonacci-like series found in nature are equally optimal for light capture, and therefore should be under similar evolutionary pressure. Our findings suggest that the iterative mechanism for organ positioning itself is a more likely target for evolutionary pressure, rather than a specific divergence angle, and our model demonstrates that the heteroblastic progression of leaf shape in A. thaliana can provide a potential fitness benefit via light capture.",2020-01-01,New Phytologist,https://openalex.org/V58631098,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16040,499,510,225,1,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955402911,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16040,journal-article,2955402911

This study investigated seasonally related effects of GnIH, GnRH, and T3 on the reproductive and growth axis in male goldfish at three stages of gonadal recrudescence. The effects of injection treatments with GnRH, GnIH and/or T3 were examined by measuring serum LH and GH levels, as well as peripheral transcript levels, using a factorial design. As expected, GnRH elevated serum LH and GH levels in a seasonally dependant manner, with maximal elevations of LH in late stages of gonadal recrudescence (Spring) and maximal increases in GH in the regressed gonadal stage (Summer). GnIH injection increased serum LH and GH levels only in fish at the regressed stage but exerted both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on GnRH-induced LH responses depending on season. T3 treatment mainly had stimulatory effects on circulating LH levels and inhibitory effects on serum GH concentrations. In the liver and testes, we observed seasonal differences in thyroid receptors, estrogen receptors, vitellogenin, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, aromatase and IGF-I transcript levels that were tissue- and sex-specific. Generally, there were no clear correlation between circulating LH and GH levels and peripheral transcript levels, presumably due to time-related response and possible direct interaction of GnRH and GnIH at the level of liver and testis.

Optical gas imaging-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys are commonly used to address fugitive methane emissions or leaks. Despite widespread use, there is little empirical measurement of the effectiveness of LDAR programs at reducing long-term leakage, especially over the scale of months to years. In this study, we measure the effectiveness of LDAR surveys by quantifying emissions at 36 unconventional liquids-rich natural gas facilities in Alberta, Canada. A representative subset of these 36 facilities were visited twice by the same detection team: an initial survey and a post-repair re-survey occurring ∼0.5–2 years after the initial survey. Overall, total emissions reduced by 44% after one LDAR survey, combining a reduction in fugitive emissions of 22% and vented emissions by 47%. Furthermore, &gt;90% of the leaks found in the initial survey were not emitting in the re-survey, suggesting high repair effectiveness. However, fugitive emissions reduced by only 22% because of new leaks that occurred between the surveys. This indicates a need for frequent, effective, and low-cost LDAR surveys to target new leaks. The large reduction in vent emissions is associated with potentially stochastic changes to tank-related emissions, which contributed ∼45% of all emissions. Our data suggest a key role for tank-specific abatement strategies as an effective way to reduce oil and gas methane emissions.

The Bayesian interpolation statistics method is used to establish an age-stratigraphy model that estimates the base of the Capitanian to be 264.28 ± 0.16 Ma, serving as the best age estimate for the Capitanian Stage at present. In addition, we review the existing geochronology from the Guadalupian Series in West Texas and seek to propose more precise temporal estimates of Guadalupian geological and biological events. These data constrain the high-frequency sequences of the Cherry Canyon and Bell Canyon formations in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park area. Accordingly, the base of the Wordian is estimated at 266.9 ± 0.4 Ma and the Illawarra geomagnetic polarity reversal in West Texas at 267.4 ± 0.4 Ma to 266.5 ± 0.3 Ma.

Strength of recommendation must incorporate key factors, including the balance between benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation (costs), with equity, feasibility, and acceptability also often included as considerations. GRADE guidelines provide recommendations that are characterized by directionality (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional). A conditional recommendation is tailored to context and primarily applied through a lens of patient preferences related to the likelihood of outcomes of importance and a shared decision-making approach. Although the 2020 Anaphylaxis GRADE guideline better informs the practice of anaphylaxis prevention through (1) identification and mitigation of risk factors for biphasic anaphylaxis and (2) evaluation of the use of glucocorticoid and/or antihistamine pretreatment, all GRADE recommendations, although directional, are conditional and as such should not be universally applied to every circumstance.Clinical guidelines provide an important opportunity to critically appraise evidence and translate evidence to practice.

Whether this pattern is driven by relatedness, similar diets or shared social environments is under debate because few studies have had access to the data necessary to disentangle these factors in wild populations. We investigated whether diet, relatedness or the 1 m proximity network best explains differences in the gut microbiome among 4 female colobus monkeys in eight social groups residing at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana. We combined demographic and behavioural data collected during May – August 200 and October 200 – April 200 with 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples collected during the latter part of each observation period. Depending on the beta diversity index, social group identity explained 19–28% of the variation in gut microbiome beta diversity. When comparing the predictive power of dietary dissimilarity, relatedness and connectedness in the 1 m proximity network, the models with social connectedness received the strongest support, even in our analyses that excluded within-group dyads. This novel finding indicates that microbes may be transmitted during intergroup encounters, which could occur either indirectly via shared environments or directly via social contact. Lastly, some of the gut microbial taxa that appear to be transmitted via 1 m proximity are associated with digestion of plant material. Further research is needed to investigate whether this type of gut microbe transmission yields health benefits, which could provide an incentive for the formation and maintenance of social bonds within and between social groups.",2020-05-01,Animal Behaviour,https://openalex.org/V157690423,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.011,17,31,163,,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012970347,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.011,journal-article,3012970347

Recent evidence indicates that disruption of the gut microbiome leads to altered hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we examined whether the effects of gut microbiome disruption on neurogenesis are age-dependent, given that both neurogenesis and the microbiome show age-related changes. Additionally, we examined memory induced functional connectivity of hippocampal networks. Control and germ-free mice at three different ages (4, 8, and 1 weeks) were trained in contextual fear-conditioning, then subsequently tested the following day. Hippocampal neurogenesis, quantified via BrdU and doublecortin, exhibited age-dependent changes relative to controls, with the established age-dependent decrease in neurogenesis being delayed in germ-free mice. Moreover, we found sex-dependent effects of germ-free status on neurogenesis, with  week old male germ-free mice having decreased neurogenesis and  week old female germ-free mice having increased neurogenesis. To assess systems-level consequences of disrupted neurogenesis, we assessed functional connectivity of hippocampal networks by inducing c-Fos expression with contextual memory retrieval and applying a previously described network analysis. Our results indicate impaired connectivity of the dentate gyrus in germ-free mice in a pattern highly correlated with adult neurogenesis. In control but not germ-free mice, functional connectivity became more refined with age, indicating that age dependent network refinement is disrupted in germ-free mice. Overall, the results show that disruption of the gut microbiome affects hippocampal neurogenesis in an age- and sex-dependent manner and that these changes are also related to changes in the dentate gyrus functional network.",2020-05-29,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,https://openalex.org/V2596924766,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00407,,,8,,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3030907271,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00407,journal-article,3030907271

Patient and family engagement in Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the primary care setting could improve the concordance between patients’ wishes and the healthcare received when patients cannot speak for themselves. The aim of this study was to better understand the barriers faced by older patients regarding talking to their family members and family physicians about ACP. Methods In this multi-site cross-sectional study, three free text questions regarding reasons patients found it difficult to discuss ACP with their families or their family physicians were part of a self-administered questionnaire about patients’ knowledge of and engagement in ACP. The questionnaire, which included closed ended questions followed by three probing open ended questions, was distributed in 2 family practices across  provinces in Canada. The free text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis and form the basis of this paper. Results One hundred two participants provided an analyzable response to the survey when asked why they haven’t talked to someone about ACP. Two hundred fifty-four answered the question about talking to their physician and 34 answered the question about talking to family members. Eight distinct themes emerged from the free text response analysis: 1. They were too young for ACP; 2. The topic is too emotional; 3. The Medical Doctor (MD) should be responsible for bringing up ACP 4. A fear of negatively impacting the patient-physician relationship; 5. Not enough time in appointments; 6. Concern about family dynamics; 7. It’s not a priority; and 8. A lack of knowledge about ACP. Conclusions Patients in our sample described many barriers to ACP discussions, including concerns about the effect these discussions may have on relationships with both family members and family physicians, and issues relating to patients’ knowledge and interpretation of the importance, responsibility for, or relevance of ACP itself. Family physicians may be uniquely placed to leverage the longitudinal, person- centred relationship they have with patients to mitigate some of these barriers.",2020-05-25,BMC Family Practice,https://openalex.org/V153257185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,,,21,1,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031024004,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01167-0,journal-article,3031024004

One of the most intensely studied factors during the past decade has been the gut microbiota, which is the community of all microbes in the intestinal tract. The gut microbiota, via energy extraction, inflammation, and other actions, is now recognized as an important player in the pathogenesis of obesity. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbial community, can initiate a cascade of metabolic disturbances in the host. Early life is a particularly important period for the development of the gut microbiota, and perturbations such as with antibiotic exposure can have long-lasting consequences for host health. In early life and throughout the life span, diet is one of the most important factors that shape the gut microbiota. Although diets high in fat and sugar have been shown to contribute to dysbiosis and disease, dietary fiber is recognized as an important fermentative fuel for the gut microbiota and results in the production of short-chain fatty acids that can act as signaling molecules in the host. One particular type of fiber, prebiotic fiber, contributes to changes in the gut microbiota, the most notable of which is an increase in the abundance of Bifidobacterium . This review highlights our current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in obesity development and the ways in which manipulating the microbiota through dietary means, specifically prebiotics, could contribute to improved health in the host, including musculoskeletal health. • Gut microbiota is one of the most recently recognized factors playing a critical role in obesity development. • Environmental and lifestyle factors profoundly change our gut microbiome throughout our lives, but particularly in early life. • Prebiotics improve metabolic health by lowering body weight and fat mass, reducing inflammation, improving glucose control, and increasing the health-promoting bacteria in our gut. • There is growing interest in how exercise influences our gut microbiome and how this factor, together with diet, might influence musculoskeletal health.",2020-03-01,Journal of Sport and Health Science,https://openalex.org/V2485047394,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.04.004,110,118,9,2,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2943026040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.04.004,journal-article,2943026040

We examined N isotope records from the Festningen section on Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway, to examine changes in nutrient availability through the Early to Middle Triassic along the northern margin of Pangea. Our results show progressive decline in N availability throughout the Griesbachian, leading to severe nutrient limitations through the remainder of the Early Triassic, until returning to a highly productive continental margin in Middle Triassic time. These results are consistent with other studies from northern and western Pangea and thus show regional nutrient limitations occurred in what should have been the main zone of marine primary productivity. Such nutrient limitation likely stressed primary production and consequently contributed to prolonged marine recovery.

However, due to their high viscosity, complex thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods are frequently applied to reduce it. Information about the distribution of oil viscosity within the reservoir can be used to help management of thermal EOR project. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) downhole tools provide a non-destructive way to determine the oil viscosity without having to recover samples (core or produced oil) from the wellbore. Tests showed that the accuracy of the literature NMR viscosity models significantly decreases with temperature increase, making them ineffective for monitoring high temperature. Moreover, improved accuracy is required for high viscosity ranges of oil representative of original reservoir conditions. An enhanced NMR viscosity model was developed and tested on a suite of 23 Canadian heavy oils recovered from different reservoirs. Subsequently, the model was tested on a single bitumen sample at temperature range 26–200 °C. Results were compared to nine well-known NMR viscosity models from the literature, and in both cases, the enhanced model scored the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) in this study. Furthermore, a simple model optimization procedure was presented, which employs nonlinear least squares (NLS) regression. Experiments were carried out at the temperatures that correspond to those in the hot steam injection EOR treatments. The same methodology can be extended for use in cyclic solvent injection (CSI) where NMR model can detect the change of oil viscosity when the solvent vapor dissolves into the oil.",2020-01-15,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116328,,,,,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981216535,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116328,journal-article,2981216535

Although GCs also activate the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the physiological significance of MR activation on early developmental growth is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that activation of both GR and MR are required for postnatal growth suppression by GCs. Differential regulation of GR and MR activation was achieved by using ubiquitous GR- (GRKO) and MR- (MRKO) knockout zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) in combination with exogenous cortisol treatment. MR activation increased protein deposition in zebrafish larvae and also upregulated lepa and downregulated lepr transcript abundance. Cortisol treatment reduced body mass and protein content in the WT, and this corresponded with the upregulation of muscle proteolytic markers, including murf1 and redd1 by GR activation. The combined activation of MR and GR by cortisol also upregulated the gh and igf1 transcript abundance, and insulin expression compared to the WT. However, cortisol-mediated reduction in body mass and protein content required the activation of both MR and GR, as activation by GR alone (MRKO + cortisol) did not reduce the larval protein content. Collectively, our results indicate that MR activation favors protein deposition and GR activation stimulates proteolysis, while their combined activation is involved in cortisol-mediated growth suppression.

However, whether this inhibition is dependent solely on certain microbial species, or is an additive effect of microbial richness, remains to be determined. Here we report that mice colonized with a combination of bacterial species with specific characteristics is required to inhibit IgE levels.

However, the actual multiphase flow in the underground reservoirs is dynamic (transient) at most time, which is affected by the dynamic capillarity effect. This review offers an overview of studies on the mechanisms, experiments and models of the dynamic capillarity effect, with particular emphasis on the dynamic capillarity effect in low permeability and tight reservoirs.

Large epidemiology studies in these communities are rare, and the impact of such exposures on reproductive outcomes are not well understood.To examine associations between prenatal maternal arsenic and mercury exposure and birth outcomes in both ASGM and non-ASGM communities in Northern Tanzania.This longitudinal prospective study included 96 women (ASGM = 788, non-ASGM = 173) of the original cohort of 105 who were followed until a pregnancy outcome was registered. Maternal spot urine samples and dried blood spots were used to measure total arsenic (T-As) and total mercury (T-Hg) in the second trimester of pregnancy. Data on adverse birth outcomes were collected in  categories: spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, and visible congenital anomalies. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to test for differences between median T-As and T-Hg by area of residence. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of stillbirth and visible congenital anomalies given maternal T-As and T-Hg levels. Modified Poisson regressions were used to estimate relative risk ratios between maternal T-As and T-Hg levels and composite adverse birth outcome, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, and preterm birth.Statistically significant differences were found in median T-As (9.6 vs. 6.3 µg/L, Mann-Whitney U-tests, Z = -3.50, p < 0.001) and median T-Hg blood concentrations (1.2 vs. 0.70 µg/L, Z = -9.88, p-value < 0.001) between women living in ASGM and non-ASGM areas respectively. In ASGM areas, the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of a composite adverse birth outcome increased with increasing T-As (aRR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.14-1.33, p < 0.0001) and T-Hg (aRR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.1-1.25, p < 0.0001) exposure. Spontaneous abortion (aRR 1.53, 95%CI: 1.28-1.83), stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.97, 95%CI: 1.45-2.66) and preterm birth (1.17, 95%CI: 1.01-1.36) were significantly associated with elevated T-As, whereas elevated T-Hg was significantly associated with stillbirth (aOR 2.49, 95%CI: 1.88-3.29) and visible congenital anomalies (aOR 2.24, 95%CI: 1.3-3.87).Over half (54.7%) of women in ASGM areas of Northern Tanzania had adverse birth outcomes and the risk of adverse birth outcomes was significantly associated with increased prenatal exposure to arsenic and mercury.",2020-04-01,Environment International,https://openalex.org/V143381477,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105450,105450,105450,137,,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003975211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105450,journal-article,3003975211

Essential trace elements like cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn) are best known for their roles as important cofactors in many enzymes involved in signalling, metabolism, and response to oxidative stress. However, deficiencies as well as long-term overexposure to these metals can result in negative health effects. Co has been associated with cardiomyopathy, lung disease, and hearing damage, while Ni is a known carcinogen, as well as a common sensitizing metal. Mn is best classified as a neurotoxicant that causes a disorder alike to idiopathic Parkinson's disease known as Manganism . Although the mechanisms of Co, Ni, and Mn toxicity are complex and have yet to be fully elucidated, research over the years has provided useful insights into understanding metal-induced detrimental effects at the cellular and molecular level. One area of research that has been explored in less detail are metal interactions with lipids and biological membranes, which are a potentially critical target as membranes are the first point of contact for cells. This review covers the current understandings of Co, Ni and Mn toxicity, in terms of human exposure, homeostasis and mechanisms of transport, potential cellular targets, and, of primary focus, metal interactions with lipid and biomembranes. A variety of effects like membrane rigidification, leakage affecting membrane potentials, lipid phase changes, alterations in lipid metabolism and changes of cellular morphology illustrate the vast potential for metal-based membrane effects contributing to their toxicity. • Increased exposure to trace metals Co, Ni, and Mn can lead to detrimental health effects • Oxidative stress is a common mechanism of metal toxicity • Co, Ni, and Mn have been found to bind to and affect the properties of model and biological lipid membranes • Biochemical differences between metals may help to explain their differing effects in the body and interactions with lipids",2020-08-01,Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta - Biomembranes,https://openalex.org/V4210187475,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2020.183250,183250,183250,1862,8,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008413005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2020.183250,journal-article,3008413005

In order to mitigate these effects, the paper proposes and implements a dynamic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that uses the three different BLE advertising channels to detect human body shadowing and compensate the RSSI values accordingly. An experiment in an indoor office environment is conducted. 70% of the observations are randomly selected and used for training and the remaining 30% are used to evaluate the algorithm.

The origin of organic carbon in these ecosystems is unknown and the source of CPR membrane lipids remains elusive. We collected cells from deep groundwater brought to the surface by eruptions of Crystal Geyser, sequenced the community, and analyzed the whole community lipidome over time. Characteristic stable carbon isotopic compositions of microbial lipids suggest that bacterial and archaeal CO 2 fixation ongoing in the deep subsurface provides organic carbon for the complex communities that reside there. Coupled lipidomic-metagenomic analysis indicates that CPR bacteria lack complete lipid biosynthesis pathways but still possess regular lipid membranes. These lipids may therefore originate from other community members, which also adapt to high in situ pressure by increasing fatty acid unsaturation. An unusually high abundance of lysolipids attributed to CPR bacteria may represent an adaptation to membrane curvature stress induced by their small cell sizes. Our findings provide new insights into the carbon cycle in the deep subsurface and suggest the redistribution of lipids into putative symbionts within this community.",2020-03-13,The ISME Journal,https://openalex.org/V149218730,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0624-4,1547,1560,14,6,1,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011257059,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0624-4,journal-article,3011257059

The present controlled-intervention study investigated the relationship between patterns of dietary intake and baseline gut microbiota in CD patients in remission and examined the effects of a dietary intervention in patients consuming a non-diversified diet [NDD]. Methods Forty outpatients with quiescent CD were recruited in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Based on 3-day food records, patients consuming a lower plant-based and higher red and processed meat-based diet were assigned to the NDD group [n = 15] and received a 12-week structured dietary intervention; all other patients were assigned to the diversified diet [DD] control group [n = 25] and received conventional management. Faecal microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids [SCFAs] and calprotectin were measured. Results At baseline the NDD and DD groups had a different faecal microbial beta-diversity [p = 0.003, permutational multivariate analysis of variance]. The NDD group had lower Faecalibacterium and higher Escherichia/Shigella relative abundances compared to the DD group [3.3 ± 5.4% vs. 8.5 ± 10.6%; 6.9 ± 12.2% vs. 1.6 ± 4.4%; p ≤ 0.03, analysis of covariance]. These two genera showed a strong negative correlation [rs = −0.60, q = 0.0002]. Faecal butyrate showed a positive correlation with Faecalibacterium [rs = 0.52, q = 0.002], and an inhibitory relationship with Escherichia/Shigella abundance [four-parameter sigmoidal model, R = −0.83; rs = −0.44, q = 0.01], respectively. After the 12 weeks of dietary intervention, no difference in microbial beta-diversity between the two groups was observed [p = 0.43]. The NDD group demonstrated an increase in Faecalibacterium [p &amp;lt; 0.05, generalized estimated equation model], and resembled the DD group at the end of the intervention [p = 0.84, t-test with permutation]. We did not find an association of diet with faecal SCFAs or calprotectin. Conclusions Dietary patterns are associated with specific gut microbial compositions in CD patients in remission. A diet intervention in patients consuming a NDD modifies gut microbial composition to resemble that seen in patients consuming a DD. These results show that diet is important in shaping the microbial dysbiosis signature in CD towards a balanced community.",2020-11-07,Journal of Crohn's and Colitis,https://openalex.org/V2735960814,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa084,1547,1557,14,11,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017647226,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa084,journal-article,3017647226

A network study was run that enabled the five models to be externally validated across nine observational healthcare datasets spanning three countries and five independent sites.The five existing models were able to be integrated into the OHDSI framework for patient-level prediction and they obtained mean c-statistics ranging between 0.57-0.63 across the  databases with sufficient data to predict stroke within  year of initial atrial fibrillation diagnosis for females with atrial fibrillation. This was comparable with existing validation studies. The validation network study was run across nine datasets within 6 days once the models were replicated. An R package for the study was published at https://github.com/OHDSI/StudyProtocolSandbox/tree/master/ExistingStrokeRiskExternalValidation.This study demonstrates the ability to scale up external validation of patient-level prediction models using a collaboration of researchers and a data standardization that enable models to be readily shared across data sites. External validation is necessary to understand the transportability or reproducibility of a prediction model, but without collaborative approaches it can take three or more years for a model to be validated by one independent researcher.

It involves a number of complex physiochemical processes, e.g., drying and evaporation, thermal expansion, pyrolysis, compressional shrinkage, gasification and combustion. As a result, coal pores constantly undergo drastic changes in the course of UCG. This work aims to shed light upon the complex changes of coal structure in the context of UCG through modelling. A 3-D UCG model was constructed using very fine grids, and several important indicators regarding pore variations were studied, i.e., weight loss of coal, solid concentrations, porosity and permeability. The modelling results were comprehensively compared with experimental data, and a good agreement in trend was achieved. It shows that coal pores alteration is associated with the various phenomena occurred in UCG, and four distinct characteristics can be categorized in the indicator curves. Furthermore, coal pores variation with respect to coal gasification and combustion, not covered in the experimental works, was also revealed.

The disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and other related Borrelia species. One of the many fascinating features of this unique pathogen is an elaborate system for antigenic variation, whereby the sequence of the surface-bound lipoprotein VlsE is continually modified through segmental gene conversion events. This perpetual changing of the guard allows the pathogen to remain one step ahead of the acquired immune response, enabling persistent infection. Accordingly, the vls locus is the most evolutionarily diverse genetic element in Lyme disease–causing borreliae. Small stretches of information are transferred from a series of silent cassettes in the vls locus to generate an expressed mosaic vlsE gene version that contains genetic information from several different silent cassettes, resulting in ∼104 possible vlsE sequences. Yet, despite its extreme evolutionary flexibility, the locus has rigidly conserved structural features. These include a telomeric location of the vlsE gene, an inverse orientation of vlsE and the silent cassettes, the presence of nearly perfect inverted repeats of ∼10 bp near the 5′ end of vlsE, and an exceedingly high concentration of G runs in vlsE and the silent cassettes.

In this study, we used a novel approach of sequestering a model PAH, phenanthrene, onto a solid carbon matrix bioanode in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) to assess its biodegradation coupled with power generation. Here, the bioanode serves as a site for enrichment of electroactive and hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms, which can simultaneously act to biodegrade a pollutant and generate power. Carbon cloth electrodes loaded with two rates of phenanthrene (2 and 20 mg cm−2) were compared using dual chamber MFCs that were operated for 50 days. The lower loading rate of 2 mg cm−2 was most efficient in the degradation of phenanthrene and had higher power production capacities (37 mW m−2) as compared to the higher loading rate of 20 mg cm−2 (power production of 19.2 mW m−2). FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) analyses showed a depletion in absorbance peak signals associated with phenanthrene.

We determined the genome sequence of the oil field isolate Sulfurimonas sp. strain CVO and compared its gene expression during nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation to the coastal sediment isolate Sulfurimonas denitrificans. Formation of elemental sulfur (S0 ) and high expression of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) genes indicates that sulfide oxidation in both strains is mediated by SQR. Subsequent oxidation of S0 was achieved by the sulfur oxidation enzyme complex (SOX). In the coastal S. denitrificans, the genes are arranged and expressed as two clusters: soxXY1 Z1 AB and soxCDY2 Z2 H, and sulfate was the sole metabolic end product. By contrast, the oil field strain CVO has only the soxCDY2 Z2 H cluster and not soxXY1 Z1 AB. Despite the absence of the soxXY1 Z1 AB cluster, strain CVO oxidized S0 to thiosulfate and sulfate, demonstrating that soxCDY2 Z2 H genes alone are sufficient for S0 oxidation in Sulfurimonas spp. and that thiosulfate is an additional metabolic end product.

Proton conductivity, water uptake, swelling ratio, hydrogen permeability, mechanical properties, and chemical stability of samples are systematically investigated. Also, membranes' characteristics are studied using FTIR, TGA, and AFM. Two stages of “annealing dominated” and “cross-linking dominated” were observed during thermal treatment. Annealing dominated samples exhibited higher flexibility and overall stability with annealing-induced homogenous microstructure while cross-linking dominated samples showed poor mechanical properties and proton conductivity. Results indicate that the treatment of SPEEK membranes with higher RS value facilitates cross-linking at much lower temperatures with a more controlled rate to inhibit excessive cross-linking.

To evaluate this, we conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of living kidney donors in Alberta, Canada between 2002-2016, using linked healthcare administrative databases. We matched 60 donors to 2,414 healthy non-donors from the general population based on age, sex, year of cohort entry, urban residence and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before cohort entry (nephrectomy date for donors and randomly assigned date for non-donors). The primary outcome was the rate of eGFR change over time (median follow-up seven years; maximum 1 years). The median age of the cohort was 4 years, 64% women, and the baseline (pre-donation) eGFR was 10 mL/min/1.73 m2. Overall, from six weeks onwards, the eGFR increased by +0.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% confidence interval +0.21 to +0.48) in donors and significantly decreased by -0.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (-0.94 to -0.75) in the matched healthy non-donors. The change in eGFR between six weeks to two years, two to five years, and over five years among donors was +1.06, +0.64, and -0.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively. In contrast to the steady age-related decline in kidney function in non-donors, post-donation kidney function on average initially increased by  mL/min/1.73 m2 per year attributable to glomerular hyperfiltration, which began to plateau by five years post-donation. Thus, the average change in eGFR over time is significantly different between donors and non-donors.",2020-07-01,Kidney International,https://openalex.org/V97303050,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.034,176,186,98,1,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022531139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.034,journal-article,3022531139

Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols. One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them. It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation.

METHODS Adults ≥ 18 years were nonconsecutively enrolled in a registry at  centers. Four categories of adult hydrocephalus were defined: transition (treated before age 18 years), unrecognized congenital (congenital pattern, not treated before age 18 years), acquired (secondary to known risk factors, treated or untreated), and suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) (≥ age 6 years, not previously treated). Data include etiology, symptoms, examination findings, neuropsychology screening, comorbidities, treatment, complications, and outcomes. Standard evaluations were administered to all patients by trained examiners, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Beck Depression Inventory–II, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form symptom bother, the 10-Meter Walk Test, the Boon iNPH gait scale, the Lawton Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL) questionnaire, the iNPH grading scale, and the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Overall, 517 individuals were enrolled. Age ranged from 18.1 to 90.7 years, with patients in the transition group (32.7 ± 10.0 years) being the youngest and those in the suspected iNPH group (76.5 ± 5.2 years) being the oldest. The proportion of patients in each group was as follows: 16.6% transition, 26.5% unrecognized congenital, 18.2% acquired, and 38.7% suspected iNPH. Excluding the 8 patients in the transition group, who all had received treatment, 79.4% of adults in the remaining  groups had not been treated at the time of enrollment. Patients in the suspected iNPH group had the poorest performance in cognitive evaluations, and those in the unrecognized congenital group had the best performance. The same pattern was seen in the Lawton ADL/IADL scores. Gait velocity was lowest in patients in the suspected iNPH group. Categories that had the most comorbidities (suspected iNPH) or etiologies of hydrocephalus that directly cause neurological injury (transition, acquired) had greater degrees of impairment compared to unrecognized congenital, which had the fewest comorbidities or etiologies associated with neurological injury. CONCLUSIONS The clinical spectrum of hydrocephalus in adults comprises more than iNPH or acquired hydrocephalus. Only 39% of patients had suspected iNPH, whereas 43% had childhood onset (i.e., those in the transition and unrecognized congenital groups). The severity of symptoms and impairment was worsened when the etiology of the hydrocephalus or complications of treatment caused additional neurological injury or when multiple comorbidities were present. However, more than half of patients in the transition, unrecognized congenital, and acquired hydrocephalus groups had minimal or no impairment. Excluding the transition group, nearly 80% of patients in the AHCRN registry were untreated at the time of enrollment. A future goal for the AHCRN is to determine whether patients with unrecognized congenital and acquired hydrocephalus need treatment and which patients in the suspected iNPH cohort actually have possible hydrocephalus and should undergo further diagnostic testing. Future prospective research is needed in the diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, quality of life, and macroeconomics of all categories of adult hydrocephalus.",2020-06-01,Journal of Neurosurgery,https://openalex.org/V1995308,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group,https://doi.org/10.3171/2019.2.jns183538,1773,1784,132,6,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2946266822,https://doi.org/10.3171/2019.2.jns183538,journal-article,2946266822

The discovery of a Boreal Capitanian crisis in Spitsbergen, with losses of similar magnitude to those in low latitudes, indicated that the event was geographically widespread, but further non-Tethyan records are needed to confirm this as a true mass extinction. The cause of this crisis is similarly controversial: While the temporal coincidence of the extinction and the onset of volcanism in the Emeishan large igneous province in China provides a clear link between those phenomena, the proximal kill mechanism is unclear. Here, we present an integrated fossil, pyrite framboid, and geochemical study of the Middle to Late Permian section of the Sverdrup Basin at Borup Fiord, Ellesmere Island, Arctic Canada. As in Spitsbergen, the Capitanian extinction is recorded by brachiopods in a chert/limestone succession 30–40 m below the Permian-Triassic boundary. The extinction level shows elevated concentrations of redox-sensitive trace metals (Mo, V, U, Mn), and contemporary pyrite framboid populations are dominated by small individuals, suggestive of a causal role for anoxia in the wider Boreal crisis. Mercury concentrations—a proxy for volcanism—are generally low throughout the succession but are elevated at the extinction level, and this spike withstands normalization to total organic carbon, total sulfur, and aluminum. We suggest this is the smoking gun of eruptions in the distant Emeishan large igneous province, which drove high-latitude anoxia via global warming. Although the global Capitanian extinction might have had different regional mechanisms, like the more famous extinction at the end of the Permian, each had its roots in large igneous province volcanism.",2020-05-01,Geological Society of America Bulletin,https://openalex.org/V3271665,Geological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1130/b35281.1,931,942,132,5-6,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970746452,https://doi.org/10.1130/b35281.1,journal-article,2970746452

These auroras have often been discussed as if they are one phenomenon, but they are not. Pulsating auroras are separable based on the extent of their pulsation and structuring into at least three subcategories. This study surveyed 1 years of all-sky camera data to determine the occurrence probability for each type of pulsating aurora in magnetic local time and magnetic latitude. Amorphous pulsating aurora (APAs) are a pervasive, nearly daily feature in the early-morning auroral oval which have an 8 % chance of occurrence at their peak. Patchy pulsating auroras (PPAs) and patchy auroras (PAs) are less common, peaking at 2 % and 2 %, respectively. Before local midnight, pulsating auroras are almost exclusively APAs. Occurrence distributions of APAs, PPAs, and PAs are mapped into the equatorial plane to approximately locate their source regions. The PA and PPA distributions primarily map to locations approximately between  and  RE, while some APAs map to farther distances, suggesting that the mechanism which structures PPAs and PAs is constrained to the inner magnetosphere.

We have established an important role for this system in motivation for drugs of abuse. The orexin-1 receptor (Ox1R) antagonist SB33486 (SB) reduces seeking of drug reward under conditions of high motivation. There is some evidence that the effects of systemic SB on reward seeking persist beyond the pharmacological availability of the drug, however the time course of these effects is not well characterized, nor is it known whether similar persistent effects are observed following intraparenchymal injections. Here, we used a behavioral economics paradigm, which allows for repeated testing of drug motivation across consecutive days, to examine the persistent effects of acute systemic and local treatment with SB on motivation for the short-acting μ‐opioid receptor agonist remifentanil. Systemic injections of SB immediately prior to behavioral testing reduced motivation for remifentanil; this effect was sustained on a subsequent test at 24 h, but not on a third test at 48 h. When injected into ventral pallidum (VP) the effects of SB were more persistent, with reduced motivation observed for up to 48 h. We next made SB injections into VP 24 h prior to behavioral testing; this produced effects that persisted for at least 72 h post-treatment. Cued reinstatement of extinguished remifentanil seeking was also attenuated by pretreatment with SB 24 h earlier. These data indicate that the effects of SB on opioid seeking behavior persist beyond the bioavailability of the compound. These observations have important ramifications for the future clinical use of orexin receptor antagonists for the treatment of addiction.",2020-03-15,Brain Research,https://openalex.org/V96638545,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146461,146461,146461,1731,,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972570320,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146461,journal-article,2972570320

We identify the resistance of Sulfolobus islandicus to Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus (SSV9) conferred by chromosomal deletions of pilin genes, pilA1 and pilA2 that are individually able to complement resistance. Mutants with deletions of both pilA1 and pilA2 or the prepilin peptidase, PibD, show the reduction in the number of pilins observed in TEM and reduced surface adherence but still adsorb SSV9. The proteinaceous outer S-layer proteins, SlaA and SlaB, are not required for adsorption nor infection demonstrating that the S-layer is not the primary receptor for SSV9 surface binding. Strains lacking both pilins are resistant to a broad panel of SSVs as well as a panel of unrelated S. islandicus rod-shaped viruses (SIRVs). Unlike SSV9, we show that pilA1 or pilA2 is required for SIRV8 adsorption. In sequenced Sulfolobus strains from around the globe, one copy of each pilA1 and pilA2 is maintained and show codon-level diversification, demonstrating their importance in nature.

Therefore, conducting genetic studies of patients at the most severe end of the depressive disorder spectrum, those with treatment-resistant depression and who are prescribed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), could lead to a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of depression. Despite ECT being one of the most effective forms of treatment for severe depressive disorders, it is usually placed at the end of treatment algorithms of current guidelines. This is perhaps because ECT has controlled risk and logistical demands including use of general anaesthesia and muscle relaxants and side-effects such as short-term memory impairment. Better understanding of the genetics and biology of ECT response and of cognitive side-effects could lead to more personalized treatment decisions. To enhance the understanding of the genomics of severe depression and ECT response, researchers and ECT providers from around the world and from various depression or ECT networks, but not limited to, such as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, the Clinical Alliance and Research in ECT, and the National Network of Depression Centers have formed the Genetics of ECT International Consortium (Gen-ECT-ic). Gen-ECT-ic will organize the largest clinical and genetic collection to date to study the genomics of severe depressive disorders and response to ECT, aiming for 30,000 patients worldwide using a GWAS approach. At this stage it will be the largest genomic study on treatment response in depression. Retrospective data abstraction and prospective data collection will be facilitated by a uniform data collection approach that is flexible and will incorporate data from many clinical practices.

Research technicians visited a total of 1 commercial dairy farms weekly. For each calf born on these farms, the farm personnel completed a birth record to document the colostrum management practices provided, level of calving assistance, calf sex, and time of birth. On the weekly visits to the farms, the technicians collected blood from calves that were 1 to 7 d of age. Serum was separated via centrifugation and the concentration of serum total protein (STP) was determined using a digital refractometer. Failed transfer of passive immunity was defined as calves having an STP of <5.2 g/dL. Data were available for 1,778 calves aged 1 to 7 d. Several differences were observed with respect to how male and female calves were managed. Male calves were more likely to receive a lower volume of colostrum, have colostrum delivered using a nipple bottle followed by an esophageal tube feeder, be fed pooled colostrum, and receive fresh colostrum rather than frozen colostrum relative to female calves. Serum total protein (STP) ranged from 3.6 to 9.7 g/dL with a mean of 5.7 g/dL (standard deviation, 0. g/dL) and 21.1% of the calves had FTPI. Using a mixed linear regression model, we identified that a calf being male (-0.1 g/dL), being delivered by a hard pull (-0.2 g/dL), and receiving the first feeding colostrum from a combination of a nipple bottle followed by an esophageal tube feeder (-0.1 g/dL) were associated with a lower concentration of STP. Feeding  L or more of colostrum in the first 24 h of life was associated with a 0.1 g/dL higher concentration of STP compared with feeding <3.9 L of colostrum. For FTPI, being delivered by a hard pull [odds ratio (OR) 2.21] and receiving the first feeding colostrum from a nipple bottle followed by an esophageal tube feeder (OR 1.83) were associated with higher odds of FTPI. Feeding >6 L of colostrum in the first 24 h of life was associated with a reduced odds (OR 0.65) of FTPI compared with feeding <3.9 L of colostrum.

Failure to engage in successful inhibitory motor control could lead to aberrant behaviors typified by an excess of motor performance. In tic disorders and Tourette syndrome (TS) - the most common tic disorder encountered in clinics - surplus motor output is rarely the only relevant clinical sign. A range of abnormal behaviors is often encountered which are historically viewed as ""disinhibition phenomena"". Here, we present the different clinical features of TS from distinct categorical domains (motor, sensory, complex behavioral) that evoke the concept of disinhibition and discuss their associations. We also present evidence for their consideration as phenomena of inhibitory dysfunction and provide an overview of studies on TS pathophysiology which support this view. We then critically dissect the concept of disinhibition in TS and illuminate other salient aspects, which should be considered in a unitary pathophysiological approach.

A better understanding of these pathways may be important for generating novel therapeutics to treat many patients with chronic inflammatory diseases who also suffer from neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Here we have systematically assessed the leukocyte infiltrate to the brain following systemic endotoxin exposure to better understand this novel route of neuroimmune communication.Mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS daily for 2,  or  consecutive days. We systematically interrogated the subsequent induction of chemokine transcription in the brain using TaqMan low-density arrays. A combination of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry was then used to characterise the accompanying leukocyte infiltrate.Repeated LPS challenges resulted in prolonged activation of brain-resident microglia, coupled with an increased local transcription of numerous chemokines. After  days of administering LPS, there was a marked increase in the expression of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL and CXCL2; the monocyte chemoattractants CCL2, CCL5, CCL7 and CCL8; and the lymphocyte chemoattractants CXCL9, CXCL1 and CXCL16. In a number of cases, this response was sustained for several days. Chemokine induction was associated with a transient recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the brain, coupled with a sustained accumulation of macrophages, CD8+ T cells, NK cells and NKT cells. Strikingly, neutrophils, monocytes and T cells appeared to extravasate from the vasculature and/or CSF to infiltrate the brain parenchyma.Prolonged exposure to a peripheral inflammatory stimulus triggers the recruitment of myeloid cells and lymphocytes to the brain.

These patients have increased rectal transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptor (TRPV1) expression, a key transducer of inflammatory pain. Because inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission exhibit dysbiosis and microbial manipulation alters TRPV1 function, our goal was to examine whether microbial perturbation modulated transient receptor potential function in a mouse model. <h3>Methods</h3> Mice were given dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis and were allowed to recover. The microbiome was perturbed by using antibiotics as well as fecal microbial transplant (FMT). Visceral and somatic sensitivity were assessed by recording visceromotor responses to colorectal distention and using hot plate/automated Von Frey tests, respectively. Calcium imaging of isolated dorsal root ganglia neurons was used as an in vitro correlate of nociception. The microbiome composition was evaluated via 16S rRNA gene variable region V4 amplicon sequencing, whereas fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were assessed by using targeted mass spectrometry. <h3>Results</h3> Postinflammatory DSS mice developed visceral and somatic hyperalgesia. Antibiotic administration during DSS recovery induced visceral, but not somatic, hyperalgesia independent of inflammation. FMT of postinflammatory DSS stool into antibiotic-treated mice increased visceral hypersensitivity, whereas FMT of control stool reversed antibiotics' sensitizing effects. Postinflammatory mice exhibited both increased SCFA-producing species and fecal acetate/butyrate content compared with controls. Capsaicin-evoked calcium responses were increased in naive dorsal root ganglion neurons incubated with both sodium butyrate/propionate alone and with colonic supernatants derived from postinflammatory mice. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The microbiome plays a central role in postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity. Microbial-derived SCFAs can sensitize nociceptive neurons and may contribute to the pathogenesis of postinflammatory visceral pain.",2020-04-11,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,https://openalex.org/V2764889447,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2020.04.003,225,244,10,2,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015694861,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2020.04.003,journal-article,3015694861

Ischaemia involving more than 10% of the left ventricular myocardium may identify patients who benefit from revascularization. However, it is not clear whether this association exists with both PCI and CABG. Materials and results Patients who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) between 199 and 201 were identified. Early revascularization was defined as PCI or CABG performed within 9 days of SPECT MPI. The association between early PCI or CABG and all-cause mortality was assessed using a doubly robust, propensity score matching analysis. In total, 5 52 patients were identified, with median follow-up 8.0 years. Early PCI was performed in 268 patients and early CABG in 1228. In the matched cohorts, early revascularization was associated with improved survival compared to medical therapy in patients with more than 15% ischaemia for both PCI [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, P = 0.002] and CABG (adjusted HR 0.73, P = 0.008). Conclusion In this observational analysis, both PCI and CABG were associated with reduced all-cause mortality in the presence of moderate to severe ischaemia after adjusting for factors leading to revascularization. As the threshold for improved outcomes with revascularization was similar for PCI and CABG, our results suggest that decisions for PCI vs. CABG for early revascularization should be determined by coronary anatomy, patient characteristics, and shared decision making, but not by the burden of ischaemia.",2020-09-01,European Journal of Echocardiography,https://openalex.org/V64942916,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa083,961,970,21,9,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024237240,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa083,journal-article,3024237240

To verify the accuracy of this approach, Rayleigh scattering cross sections of nitrogen and argon were measured and found to be in quantitative agreement with literature values. The mirror reflectivity exceeded 99.98 %, at its maximum near 37 nm, resulting in an absorption path length of  km from a  m long optical cavity. The instrument precision was assessed through Allan variance analyses and showed minimum deviations of ±5 and ±21 pptv (1σ) for HONO and NO2, respectively, at an optimum acquisition time of  min. Measurements of HONO and NO2 mixing ratios in laboratory-generated mixtures by IBBCEAS were compared to thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS) data and agreed within combined experimental uncertainties.

In this work, a framework is proposed to forecast the aggregated power generation of a large fleet of small behind-the-meter solar PV sites. The outputs of those sites are not individually measured and thus, the aggregated output is “invisible” to power system operators. The proposed model uses the available historical power generation data of a very limited number of representative sites in the region, along with Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) inputs. This way, it is not necessary to constantly monitor all the sites in the region. Fuzzy Arithmetic Wavelet Neural Networks (FAWNN) are used to develop the forecasting engine, providing fuzzy confidence intervals for any desired level, so this methodology can handle various shapes of uncertainties in the input data. The proposed model is validated using actual PV generation data from 667 sites in California.

We aim to validate the newly proposed classification, to explore the neoplastic nature of the non-adenomatous lesions and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the different histomorphologies. Methods 4 background precursor lesions identified in 5 cases of surgically resected IBD-associated colorectal and ileal carcinomas were reviewed for the histomorphological features (classified into adenomatous, mucinous, sessile serrated adenoma (SSA)-like, traditional serrated adenoma-like, differentiated, eosinophilic and serrated not otherwise specified (NOS)) and analysed for a key panel of colonic cancer-related molecular markers. Results Approximately 60% of the lesions were adenomatous, of which some had mixed serrated, mucinous or eosinophilic changes. The remaining non-adenomatous lesions, including all other types except SSA-like type, mostly showed mixed features and focal adenomatous dysplasia. KRAS mutation and p53 mutant-type expression were found in about half cases across all types, while PIK3CA mutation only in some of adenomatous and eosinophilic lesions and MLH1/PMS2 loss in a subset of adenomatous, mucinous and eosinophilic but not in differentiated and serrated lesions. SAT-B2 or PTEN loss and IMP3 overexpression were seen in a small subset of lesions. No BRAF , NRAS or EGFR gene mutation was detected in any type. Certain molecular-morphological correlations were demonstrated; however, no single or combined molecular alteration(s) was specific to any particular morphological type. Conclusions IBD-associated precancerous lesions are heterogeneous both histologically and molecularly. True colitis-associated adenomatous lesions are unlikely conventional adenomas.

Prior research has focused on understanding why some entrepreneurs are more likely to pay bribes than others. It typically assumes that paying bribes will lead to an intended – albeit unfair – competitive advantage. We challenge this assumption and uncover a bribery paradox: drawing upon sensemaking logic, we argue that beyond gaining an immediate benefit from bribing, entrepreneurs who frequently pay bribes may in the longer run be enacting a ‘new normal’ business environment perceived as high in obstacles, especially in transition countries. As sensemaking is grounded in identity construction and one’s social context, we argue that owners of family firms will be especially vulnerable to the dangers of perceiving greater obstacles over time and enacting an obstacle‐ridden ‘new normal’ business environment.

Here, we applied four kinds of graphene-based single-atom iron catalysts (FeSA/GS) for catalytic oxidation of Hg0 by O2 to determine the reaction mechanisms via analysis of final products, reaction path, dominant mechanism and catalytic activity based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results reveal that the final product for catalytic oxidation of Hg0 by O2 is the chain (HgO)2 cluster and its desorption process of the chain (HgO)2 cluster is the rate-determining step. Among the four kinds of FeSA/GS investigated, the single-atom iron catalyst supported with double vacancy doped four N atoms graphene-based substrate has the highest catalytic activity with energy barrier of the rate-determining step at 2.34 eV. The adsorption energy of O2 has an obviously positive proportional relationship with the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The stability of catalyst is analyzed through relative binding energy and ab inito molecular dynamics simulation.

The aim of this study was to determine whether schizophrenia patients with clozapine-induced myocarditis have a genetic predisposition compared with clozapine-tolerant controls. We measured different types of genetic variation, including genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), coding variants that alter protein expression, and variable forms of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes, alongside traditional clinical risk factors in 4 cases and 6 controls. We calculated a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on variation at 9 different genetic sites, to estimate the genetic liability to clozapine-induced myocarditis. Our genome-wide association analysis identified four SNPs suggestive of increased myocarditis risk ( P &lt;  × 10 − ), with odds ratios ranging 5.5–13.7. The SNP with the lowest P value was rs74675399 (chr19p13.3, P = 1.21 × 10 − ; OR = 6.36), located in the GNA15 gene, previously associated with heart failure. The HLA-C*07:01 allele was identified as potentially predisposing to clozapine-induced myocarditis (OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.11–7.53), consistent with a previous report of association of the same allele with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Another seven HLA alleles, including HLA-B*07:02 (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.05–1.2) were found to be putatively protective. Long-read DNA sequencing provided increased resolution of HLA typing and validated the HLA associations. The PRS explained 66% of liability ( P value = 9. × 10 − ). Combining clinical and genetic factors together increased the proportion of variability accounted for ( r  0.73, P = 9. × 10 − ).

It is unknown, however, how these compliances interact with each other when the MBS of a running shoe is increased. The purpose of this study was to investigate how structures of the foot-shoe interface are influenced during running by changes to the MBS of sport shoes. Methods A randomised crossover trial was performed, where 13 male, recreational runners ran on an instrumented treadmill at 3.5 m·s −1 while motion capture was used to estimate foot arch, plantar muscle-tendon unit (pMTU), and shank muscle-tendon unit (sMTU) behaviour in two conditions: (1) control shoe and (2) the same shoe with carbon fibre plates inserted to increase the MBS. Results Running in a shoe with increased MBS resulted in less deformation of the arch (mean ± SD; stiff, 7.26 ± 1.78°; control, 8.84 ± 2.87°; p ≤ 0.05), reduced pMTU shortening (stiff, 4.39 ± 1.5 mm; control, 6.46 ± 1.4 mm; p ≤ 0.01), and lower shortening velocities of the pMTU (stiff, − 0.2 ± 0.0 m·s −1 ; control, − 0.3 ± 0.0 m·s −1 ; p ≤ 0.01) and sMTU (stiff, − 0.3 ± 0.0 m·s −1 ; control, − 0.4 ± 0.1 m·s −1 ; p ≤ 0.001) compared to a control condition. The positive and net work performed at the arch and pMTU, and the net work at the sMTU were significantly lower in the stiff compared to the control condition. Conclusion The findings of this study showed that if a compliance of the foot-shoe interface is altered during running (e.g. by increasing the MBS of a shoe), the mechanics of other structures change as well. This could potentially affect long-distance running performance.",2020-02-07,Sports Medicine - Open,https://openalex.org/V2736513330,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-020-0241-9,,,6,1,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008812383,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-020-0241-9,journal-article,3008812383

More than half a century ago, Gordon, Huxley and Julian provided strong support for the ‘sliding filament’ theory that allowed prediction of the active isometric force as a function of sarcomere length (SL). Although the theory was established using single muscle fibers, the sarcomere force-length (FL) relationship has been extrapolated to whole muscles in an attempt to unravel in-vivo muscle function. However, these extrapolations were frequently associated with non-trivial assumptions, such as muscle length changes corresponding linearly to SL changes. However, the sarcomere force-length relationship in whole muscles may not behave as theoretically predicted due to the structural complexity of muscles, the force transmission, pressures and shear forces developed inside muscles, and the great SL non-uniformity recently observed in whole muscles. Here, we determined the in-situ sarcomere FL relationship in a whole muscle preparation by simultaneously measuring muscle force and individual SLs in an intact muscle-tendon unit (MTU) using state-of-the-art multi-photon excitation microscopy. We found that despite great SL non-uniformity, the mean value of SLs measured from a minute volume of the mid-belly, equivalent to about 5 x 10−6 % of the total muscle volume, agrees well with the theoretically predicted FL relationship, but only if the precise contractile filament lengths are known, and if passive forces from parallel elastic components and activation-associated sarcomere shortening are considered properly. As SLs are not uniformly distributed across the whole muscle and changes in SLs with muscle length are location-dependent, our results may not be valid for the proximal or distal parts of the muscle. The approach described here, and our findings, may encourage future studies to determine the role of SL non-uniformity in influencing sarcomere FL properties in different muscles and for different locations within single muscles.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,https://openalex.org/V20257348,The Company of Biologists,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.215020,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009024573,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.215020,journal-article,3009024573

In this study, by comparing void volumes of carbon nanopores determined under different temperatures and pressures using GCMC (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo) simulation, suitable experimental conditions for helium expansion tests are obtained. Five volumes, including one apparent volume Vapp, three referred volumes Vref and one physical volume Vphy, are recognized. The apparent volume Vapp corresponds to the volume directly determined under traditional experimental conditions, while three referred volumes are determined at 500 K with different pressure ranges (low, moderate, high). The physical volume is calculated by multiplying a pore width and a surface area. Besides, a volume determined by using a helium probe is named an accessible volume Vacc and used as a criterion for a determined volume through mass balance. It is found that use of a void volume determined under traditional experimental conditions or a physical volume leads to negative adsorption amounts at high pressures. Considering an economic effect and measurement accuracy, determining a void volume by helium expansion tests within a moderate pressure range at 500 K is suggested. Excess isotherms of methane calculated by the suggested volume are more appropriate and of great physical meanings for further investigation of adsorption mechanisms.",2020-06-15,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117499,117499,117499,270,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010550552,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117499,journal-article,3010550552

Cats were video-recorded simultaneously at baseline, 15 min after sedation, and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after extubation for subsequent image assessment (FGS-IMG), which was performed six months later by the same observer. The agreement between FGS-RT and FGS-IMG scores was calculated using the Bland &amp; Altman method for repeated measures. The effects of sedation (baseline versus 15 min) and OVH (baseline versus 24 h) were assessed using linear mixed models. Responsiveness to the administration of rescue analgesia (FGS scores before versus one hour after) was assessed using paired t -tests. Results Minimal bias (−0.057) and narrow limits of agreement (−0.351 to 0.237) were observed between the FGS-IMG and FGS-RT. Scores at baseline (FGS-RT: 0.16 ± 0.1 and FGS-IMG: 0.1 ± 0.13) were not different after sedation (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.15, p = 0.3 and FGS-IMG: 0.16 ± 0.15, p = 0.99) nor at 24 h after extubation (FGS-RT: 0.16 ± 0.12, p = 0. and FGS-IMG: 0. ± 0.12, p = 0.96). Thirteen cats required rescue analgesia; their FGS scores were lower one hour after analgesic administration (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.1 and FGS-IMG: 0.1 ± 0.17) than before (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.24, p = 0.00 and FGS-IMG: 0. ± 0.19, p = 0.015). Conclusions Real-time assessment slightly overestimates image scoring; however, with minimal clinical impact. Sedation with acepromazine-buprenorphine and ovariohysterectomy using a balanced anesthetic protocol did not influence the FGS scores. Responsiveness to analgesic administration was observed with both the FGS-RT and FGS-IMG.",2020-04-14,PeerJ,https://openalex.org/V1983995261,PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8967,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017194914,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8967,journal-article,3017194914

Antimicrobial peptides with a characterized MOA induce the expression of multiple bacterial outer membrane modifications, which are required for resistance to these membrane-targeting peptides. Mini-Tn 5-lux mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Tn insertions disrupting outer membrane protective modifications were assessed for sensitivity against plant defensin peptides. These transcriptional lux reporter strains were also evaluated for lux gene expression in response to sublethal plant defensin exposure. Also, a plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae was modified through transposon mutagenesis to create mutants that are resistant to in vitro MtDef4 treatments. Results Plant defensins displayed specific and potent antibacterial activity against strains of P. aeruginosa . A defensin from Medicago truncatula , MtDef4, induced dose-dependent gene expression of the aminoarabinose modification of LPS and surface polycation spermidine production operons. The ability for MtDef4 to damage bacterial outer membranes was also verified visually through fluorescent microscopy. Another defensin from M. truncatula , MtDef5, failed to induce lux gene expression and limited outer membrane damage was detected with fluorescent microscopy. The transposon insertion site on MtDef4 resistant P. syringae pv. syringae mutants was sequenced, and modifications of ribosomal genes were identified to contribute to enhanced resistance to plant defensin treatments. Conclusions MtDef4 damages the outer membrane similar to polymyxin B, which stimulates antimicrobial peptide resistance mechanisms to plant defensins. MtDef5, appears to have a different antibacterial MOA. Additionally, the MtDef4 antibacterial mode of action may also involve inhibition of translation.",2020-06-19,BMC Microbiology,https://openalex.org/V128543880,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-020-01852-1,,,20,1,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036309876,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-020-01852-1,journal-article,3036309876

Quantitative analyses using the Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 3,928) reveal that older adults who only received formal care reported lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of life satisfaction when compared with respondents who received informal or a blend of home care. Qualitative analyses of persons aged 65+ years receiving formal and informal home care in Ontario (n = 34) suggest that formal care bolstered care recipients' autonomy and reduced their sense of being a burden on family. In turn, receiving formal care served to improve these older adults' social connectedness and well-being.

From July to December 2015, 4 consecutive patients referred to CEUS with indeterminate MRI scans comprise our study cohort. There are 5 indeterminate nodule-like observations and 1 arterial phase hyperenhancing foci, suggesting pseudolesions/arterio-portal shunts. MRI and CEUS lesions are classified according to their enhancement features in all phases and Liver Imaging and Reporting Data System (LI-RADS) in a blind read format. Clinical pathologic correlation and 24 months follow-up are performed. A majority, 37/50 (74%), of indeterminate nodule-like observations have arterial phase enhancement without washout on MRI. CEUS further characterizes enhancement and shows washout in 14/37 (38%). In total, CEUS diagnoses 1 malignant lesions in 14 patients including 14 HCC and  ICC. 12/16 (75%) malignant lesions are confirmed by biopsy or follow-up. Ultrasound identification of a nodule differentiates real nodules from pseudolesions. Of the ten suspected arterial-portal shunts on MRI, two show a real nodule on ultrasound, confirmed as an HCC and a regenerative nodule. 15/42 (36%) patients have LI-RADS escalated from LR- or  on MRI to LR- or  on CEUS. Overall, the sensitivity of CEUS is (13/16) 81.3% and specificity is (37/37) 100% for malignant diagnosis. Grayscale ultrasound detects true nodules.

In this study, we compare the provincial administrative databases and illustrate the potential impact of database differences on a CNODES study about domperidone and the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (VT/SCD). Methods We assessed the impact of varying versions and precision of the International Classification of Diseases coding system in physician claims data, and the content and completeness of hospital discharge abstracts across CNODES sites, as these variations can introduce differences in the study cohorts formed and affect study results. Results In our study of 21 96 patients, hospital diagnosis type (such as most responsible, admitting, or secondary diagnosis) was missing in some provinces, resulting in misclassification of the outcome and variation in rates and risk estimates. Incidence rates of VT/SCD ranged from 19.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-22.2) per 1 00 person-years in British Columbia to 53.4 (95% CI 50.3-56.5) in Quebec. While most provinces reported an increased risk of VT/SCD, a null effect was observed in Quebec (rate ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.79-1.41). Conclusions Distributed analyses allow for rapid responses to drug safety signals. However, variation in characteristics of the administrative data across research centres can influence study results.

Classically, fractional-order impedances are characterized in the frequency domain by a fractional-order Laplacian of the form $$s^{\pm \alpha }$$ with an order $$0<\alpha <1$$. The ideal inductor and capacitor correspond, respectively, to setting $$\alpha =\pm 1$$. In the range $$1<\alpha <2$$, fractional-order impedances can still be obtained before turning into a Frequency- Dependent Negative Resistor (FDNR) at $$\alpha =\pm 2$$. Here, we propose an electronically tunable fractional-order impedance emulator with adjustable order in the full range $$0<\alpha <2$$.

2020,2,3,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2974956898,Does postactivation potentiation (PAP) increase voluntary performance?,"The transient increase in torque of an electrically evoked twitch following a voluntary contraction is called postactivation potentiation (PAP). Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains is the most accepted mechanism explaining the enhanced electrically evoked twitch torque. While many authors attribute voluntary postactivation performance enhancement (PAPE) to the positive effects of PAP, few actually confirmed that contraction was indeed potentiated using electrical stimulation (twitch response) at the time that PAPE was measured. Thus, this review aims to investigate if increases in voluntary performance after a conditioning contraction (CC) are related to the PAP phenomenon. For this, studies that confirmed the presence of PAP through an evoked response after a voluntary CC and concurrently evaluated PAPE were reviewed. Some studies reported increases in PAPE when PAP reaches extremely high values. However, PAPE has also been reported when PAP was not present, and unchanged/diminished performance has been identified when PAP was present. This range of observations demonstrates that mechanisms of PAPE are different from mechanisms of PAP. These mechanisms of PAPE still need to be understood and those studying PAPE should not assume that regulatory light chain phosphorylation is the mechanism for such enhanced voluntary performance. Novelty The occurrence of PAP does not necessarily mean that the voluntary performance will be improved. Improvement in voluntary performance is sometimes observed when the PAP level reaches extremely high values. Other mechanisms may be more relevant than that for PAP in the manifestation of acute increases in performance following a conditioning contraction.",2020-04-01,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism",https://openalex.org/V173941543,Canadian Science Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-0406,349,356,45,4,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2974956898,https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-0406,journal-article,2974956898

Sarcomerogenesis following EC is thought to be a protective muscle adaptation, preventing muscle injury in future eccentric exercise bouts (repeated bout effect). However, the mechanisms underlying sarcomerogenesis in EC remain unknown, and the sarcomerogenic responses observed in response to EC and CC are contradictory. We measured sarcomere length, sarcomere length uniformity, serial sarcomere number, and fascicle length in gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in sedentary (SED) mice, and in mice following protocols of moderate uphill (TRU) and downhill (TRD) training and uphill (OTU) and downhill (OTD) overtraining. We found pain sensitivity after the first bout of EC exercise on TRD and OTD followed by a normalized sensory response after four weeks of training, indicating a repeated bout effect. However, these findings were not associated with sarcomerogenesis, as serial sarcomere numbers did not increase in TRD and OTD skeletal muscle samples compared to controls (SED). However, we found a decrease in serial sarcomere number in VL and TA in OTU group mice, which was associated with a decrease in fascicle length and no change of sarcomere length at the tested joint configuration.

The capacity to frame interactions with tools as dialogic exchanges with co-participants is a productive practice for disciplinary engagement in science and for computational thinking (Chandrasekharan and Nersessian 2015; Dennet 1989; Latour 1993; Pickering 1995). We propose that computational models have unique affordances for dialogic interaction because they are probabilistic and iteratively executable, features that provide an entry point for students to adopt stances that treat computational models as participants. Our analysis reveals that existing patterns in students’ social interactions are resources for interacting flexibly with computational tools as participants. In particular, we found that students treated computational models as participants in three ways: (1) as conversational peers, (2) as co-constructors of lines of inquiry, and (3) as projections of students’ agency and identity. Our data also demonstrate that students take on flexible, rather than fixed, stances toward computational participants. These stances parallel scientists’ interactions with non-human entities, which often involve treating tools as agentive participants in inquiry (Latour 1999; Pickering 1995), affording students a pathway to practices at the intersection of disciplinary engagement and computational thinking.",2020-02-01,Journal of Science Education and Technology,https://openalex.org/V158654976,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-019-09797-5,101,119,29,1,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989035709,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10956-019-09797-5,journal-article,2989035709

However, bias related to the automated protocol is unknown. This study provides insight into error bias that is present when using uncorrected contours and inter-operator precision error based on operator training. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography workflow includes manually correcting contours generated by the manufacturer’s automated protocol. There is interest in minimizing corrections to save time and reduce precision error; however, bias related to the automated protocol is unknown. This study quantifies error bias when contours are uncorrected and identifies the impact of operator training on bias and precision error. Forty-five radii and tibiae scans across a representative range of bone density were analyzed using the automated and manually corrected contours of three operators, with training ranging from beginner to expert, and compared with a “ground truth” to estimate bias. Inter-operator precision was measured across operators. The tibia had greater error bias than the radius when contours were uncorrected, with compartmental bone mineral densities and cortical microarchitecture having greatest biases, which could have significant implications for interpretation of studies using this skeletal site. Bias and precision error were greatest when contours were corrected by the beginner operator; however, when this operator was removed, bias was no longer present and inter-operator precision was between 0.01 and 3.74% for all parameters except cortical porosity.

In this study, the role of aromatic hydrogen in sulfonation with concentrated H2SO4 was investigated using petroleum coke (petcoke), graphite, and biochar as the carbon materials. Through ball milling and calcination, the amount of aromatic hydrogen on the petcoke could be increased or decreased, respectively. After sulfonation at 8 °C with concentrated H2SO4, the produced acidity (i.e., -SO3H groups) increased as the amount of aromatic hydrogen increased from essentially no acidity on graphite to 0.5 mmol/g on biochar and 1.25 mmol/g on petcoke (particle sizes of 45-90 μm) indicating the importance of aromatic hydrogen during sulfonation. Calcination (350 °C for  h) of the petcoke before sulfonation decreased the acidity to 0.5 mmol/g, while ball milling (with isopropanol and silica for 2 h) increased the acidity to 3.73 mmol/g. The sulfonated petcoke samples were used as catalysts for the esterification reaction between octanoic acid and methanol at 6 °C and the turnover frequencies were 48-85 h-1.

This paper employs a scoping review methodology to map scholarship produced during this period and develop a more coherent body of knowledge concerning the relationship between social stigma and female-identified sex workers. Twenty-six pieces of research related to sex work stigma are identified and reviewed from across the disciplines of sociology (n = 8), public health (n = 6), social work (n = 4), criminology (n = 2), psychology (n = 2), communications (n = 2), nursing (n = 1), and political science (n = 1). This scoping review identifies the main sources of sex-work stigma, the ways in which sex-work stigma manifests for sex workers, and stigma resistance strategies, as discussed in this body of literature. If, as theorists and researchers suggest, social stigma is at the foundation of the pernicious violence against sex workers, understanding the sources, manifestations, and resistance strategies of sex-work stigma is critical to countering and shifting this stigma. Findings include potential areas of research, policy, and practice to address and challenge sex-work stigma, recognizing that successful social transformation occurs in a dialectic between society’s socio-structural, community, and intrapersonal levels.",2020-10-01,Sexuality and Culture,https://openalex.org/V105379996,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-020-09707-7,1653,1682,24,5,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003610613,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-020-09707-7,journal-article,3003610613

All published studies on trunk or extremities ALT/WDLS with reported outcome data were considered and independently screened for inclusion by at least two of the authors.A total of eighteen studies comprising 79 patients with ALT/WDLS were included. 58 patients underwent marginal excision, with local recurrence observed in 6 (11.9%). 21 patients underwent wide excision with local recurrence in 7(3.3%). Recurrent tumors were successfully re-resected with marginal or wide excision. Dedifferentiation was confirmed in  patients (1.1%), and a distant pulmonary metastasis in  patient (0.1%).Marginal excision of truncal or extremities ALT/WDLS results in a slightly higher local recurrence rate.

In this study, we used a robotic object hitting task to assess bilateral sensorimotor control and visuospatial skills in children with hemiparesis due to perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) or periventricular venous infarct (PVI). We hypothesized that performance would be impaired bilaterally and be related to motor behavior and clinical assessment of visuospatial attention. Methods Forty-nine children with perinatal stroke and hemiparetic cerebral palsy and 15 typically developing (TD) children participated in the study. Participants performed a bilateral object hitting task using the KINARM Exoskeleton Robot, in which they used virtual paddles at their fingertips to hit balls that fell from the top of the screen with increasing speed and frequency over 2.3 min. We quantified performance across 1 parameters including number of balls hit with each hand, movement speed and area, biases between hands, and spatial biases. We determined normative ranges of performance accounting for age by fitting 95% prediction bands to the TD children. We compared parameters between TD, AIS, and PVI groups using ANCOVAs accounting for age effects. Lastly, we performed regression analysis between robotic and clinical measures. Results The majority of children with perinatal stroke hit fewer balls with their affected arm compared to their typically developing peers. We also found deficits with the ipsilesional (“unaffected”) arm. Children with AIS had greater impairments than PVI. Despite hitting fewer balls, we only identified 18% of children as impaired in hand speed or movement area. Performance on the Behavioral Inattention Test accounted for 21–32% of the variance in number of balls hit with the unaffected hand. Conclusions Children with perinatal stroke-induced hemiparetic cerebral palsy may have complex bilateral deficits reflecting a combination of impairments in motor skill and visuospatial attention. Clinical assessments and interventions should address the interplay between motor and visuospatial skills.",2020-02-13,Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation,https://openalex.org/V2299478,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-020-0654-1,,,17,1,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009480049,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-020-0654-1,journal-article,3009480049

The Mre11 complex and ATM govern a major axis of the DDR and several lines of evidence implicate that axis in tumor suppression. Components of the Mre11 complex are mutated in approximately five percent of human cancers. Inherited mutations of complex members cause severe chromosome instability syndromes, such as Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, which is associated with strong predisposition to malignancy. And in mice, Mre11 complex mutations are markedly more susceptible to oncogene- induced carcinogenesis. The complex is integral to all modes of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and is required for the activation of ATM to effect DNA damage signaling. To understand which functions of the Mre11 complex are important for tumor suppression, we undertook mining of cancer genomic data from the clinical sequencing program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which includes the Mre11 complex among the 468 genes assessed. Twenty five mutations in MRE11 and RAD50 were modeled in S. cerevisiae and in vitro. The mutations were chosen based on recurrence and conservation between human and yeast. We found that a significant fraction of tumor-borne RAD50 and MRE11 mutations exhibited separation of function phenotypes wherein Tel1/ATM activation was severely impaired while DNA repair functions were mildly or not affected. At the molecular level, the gene products of RAD50 mutations exhibited defects in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The data reflect the importance of Rad50 ATPase activity for Tel1/ATM activation and suggest that inactivation of ATM signaling confers an advantage to burgeoning tumor cells.",2020-03-18,PLOS Genetics,https://openalex.org/V103870658,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008422,e1008422,e1008422,16,3,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011744506,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008422,journal-article,3011744506

Next, the framework is applied to the benchmark problem for the flow over a hemispherical fore-body. The numerical results are compared to the reported experimental data, showing a good agreement over the range of cavitation numbers.

Transthoracic echocardiography can identify right ventricular dysfunction to recognize intermediate–high-risk patients. <h3>Research Question</h3> Is echocardiographic-derived stroke volume index (SVI) associated with death or cardiopulmonary decompensation in intermediate-risk patients with PE? <h3>Study Design and Methods</h3> and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated echocardiographic-derived variables that included SVI in normotensive patients with acute PE who were admitted between January 201 and March 2017. SVI was determined with the use of the Doppler velocity-time integral in the left or right ventricular outflow tract. The primary outcome was in-hospital PE-related death or cardiopulmonary decompensation. We used logistic regression to determine the association between SVI and outcomes and receiver operating characteristic analysis to compare the performance of SVI and other echocardiographic measures. <h3>Results</h3> The primary outcome occurred in 2 of the 66 intermediate-risk patients (3.9%) with PE. Univariate logistic regression showed an OR of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.23-1.52; <i>P</i> < .001) per 1-mL/m<sup>2</sup> decrease in SVI for the primary outcome. Bivariate logistic regression showed that SVI was independent of age, sex, heart rate, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, troponin, and Bova score. SVI had the highest C-statistic of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96) of all echocardiographic variables with a Youden's J-statistic that identifies an optimal cut-point of 20.0 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to positive and negative likelihood ratios of 6.5 (95% CI, 5.0-8.6) and 0.

Mitochondrial dysfunction can accompany enteric inflammation, but any contribution of altered mitochondrial dynamics (ie, fission/fusion) to gut inflammation is unknown. We hypothesized that perturbed mitochondrial dynamics would contribute to colitis. Methods Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for markers of mitochondrial fission and fusion was applied to tissue from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated mice. An inhibitor of mitochondrial fission, P110 (prevents dynamin related protein [Drp]-1 binding to mitochondrial fission 1 protein [Fis1]) was tested in the DSS and di-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) models of murine colitis, and the impact of DSS ± P110 on intestinal epithelial and macrophage mitochondria was assessed in vitro. Results Analysis of colonic tissue from mice with DSS-colitis revealed increased mRNA for molecules associated with mitochondrial fission (ie, Drp1, Fis1) and fusion (optic atrophy factor 1) and increased phospho-Drp1 compared with control. Systemic delivery of P110 in prophylactic or treatment regimens reduced the severity of DSS- or DNBS-colitis and the subsequent hyperalgesia in DNBS-mice. Application of DSS to epithelial cells or macrophages caused mitochondrial fragmentation. DSS-evoked perturbation of epithelial cell energetics and mitochondrial fragmentation, but not cell death, were ameliorated by in vitro co-treatment with P110. Conclusions We speculate that the anti-colitic effect of systemic delivery of the anti-fission drug, P110, works at least partially by maintaining enterocyte and macrophage mitochondrial networks. Perturbed mitochondrial dynamics can be a feature of intestinal inflammation, the suppression of which is a potential novel therapeutic direction in inflammatory bowel disease.",2020-04-13,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,https://openalex.org/V2764889447,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2020.04.004,287,307,10,2,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016270993,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2020.04.004,journal-article,3016270993

The migration through a limited number of paths through tissues and capillary networks seems efficient and ‘traffic jams’ are generally avoided. However, the mechanisms that guide efficient trafficking of large numbers of neutrophils through capillary networks are not well understood. Here we show that pairs of neutrophils arriving closely one after another at capillary bifurcations migrate to alternating branches in vivo and in vitro. Perturbation of chemoattractant gradients and the increased hydraulic resistance induced by the first neutrophil in one branch biases the migration of the following neutrophil towards the other branch. These mechanisms guide neutrophils to efficiently navigate through capillary networks and outline the effect of inter-neutrophil interactions during migration on overall lymphocyte trafficking patterns in confined environments.",2020-05-13,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15476-6,,,,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024063149,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15476-6,journal-article,3024063149

Our objective was to determine whether supplementing individual HMOs to a weanling diet alters growth and gut health in rats. Healthy three-week-old Sprague Dawley rat pups were randomized to control, 2′-O-fucosyllactose (2′FL)- and 3′sialyllactose (3′SL)-fortified diets alone or in combination at physiological doses for eight weeks. Body composition, intestinal permeability, serum cytokines, fecal microbiota composition, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the gastrointestinal tract were assessed. Males fed a control diet were 10% heavier and displayed elevated interleukin (IL-18) (p = 0.01) in serum compared to all HMO-fortified groups at week 11. No differences in body composition were detected between groups. In females, HMOs did not affect body weight but 2′FL + 3′SL significantly increased cecum weight. All female HMO-fortified groups displayed significant reductions in intestinal permeability compared to controls (p = 0.02). All HMO-fortified diets altered gut microbiota composition and mRNA expression in the gastrointestinal tract, albeit differently according to sex.

But are PCH and PVOD distinct entities that occur in isolation, or are they closely intertwined manifestations along a spectrum of the same disease? The classic clinical features of both PCH and PVOD include signs and symptoms related to pulmonary hypertension, hypoxaemia, markedly impaired diffusion capacity of the lung and abnormal chest imaging with ground glass opacities, septal lines and lymphadenopathy. In recent years, increasing evidence suggests that the clinical presentation, histopathological features, genetic substrate and pathobiological mechanisms of PCH and PVOD are overlapping and usually indistinguishable. The discovery of biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  α kinase  ( EIF2AK4 ) gene in heritable PCH and PVOD greatly advanced our understanding of the overlapping nature of these conditions. Furthermore, recognition of PCH and PVOD-like changes in other pulmonary vascular diseases and in conditions that cause chronic pulmonary venous hyper-perfusion or hypertension suggests that PCH/PVOD may develop as a reactive process to various insults or injuries to the pulmonary vasculature, rather than being primary angiogenic disorders.",2020-05-27,European Respiratory Review,https://openalex.org/V168221024,European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0168-2019,190168,190168,29,156,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032326734,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0168-2019,journal-article,3032326734

Effective connectivity was determined from spontaneous activity recordings using calcium fluorescence imaging. We used generalized transfer entropy as tool to infer the effective connectivity. We carried out numerical simulations to build networks that mimicked the experimental ones and to test the reliability of the connectivity–inference algorithm. Effective connectivity traits were investigated during the development of the cultures over two weeks, and along the gradual blockade of excitatory connections through CNQX.

A 70-year-old female developed severe HIT (platelet count, 25 × 109/L) post-glioblastoma resection during heparin thromboprophylaxis, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and symptomatic lower-limb deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Despite therapeutic-dose fondaparinux, thrombocytopenia/hypofibrinogenemia persisted, with new symptomatic catheter-associated upper-extremity DVT. This clinical picture could be explained by autoimmune HIT (aHIT) refractory to fondaparinux or by fondaparinux cross-reactivity, so high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given (to treat possible aHIT) and fondaparinux switched to rivaroxaban, with subsequent clinical recovery. In vitro studies revealed strong fondaparinux cross-reactivity, without aHIT antibodies. Moreover, the patient's serotonin-release assay became negative post-IVIG, suggesting in-vivo inhibition of HIT antibody-induced platelet activation. Our case illustrates fondaparinux cross-reactivity in HIT manifesting as persisting thrombocytopenia, new thrombosis, and DIC, with successful rivaroxaban treatment, adding to emerging data that oral factor Xa inhibitors are efficacious for treating HIT.",2020-01-01,Platelets,https://openalex.org/V103305516,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/09537104.2019.1652263,124,127,31,1,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2967026425,https://doi.org/10.1080/09537104.2019.1652263,journal-article,2967026425

To determine the prevalence of NCI and its associated subtypes as well as predictive variables, we investigated patients with HIV/AIDS receiving universal health care. Recruited adult HIV-infected subjects underwent a neuropsychological (NP) test battery with established normative (sex-, age-, and education-matched) values together with assessment of their demographic and clinical variables. Three patient groups were identified including neurocognitively normal (NN, n = 246), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND, n = 78), and neurocognitively impaired-other disorders (NCI-OD, n = 46). Univariate, multiple logistic regression and machine learning analyses were applied. Univariate analyses showed variables differed significantly between groups including birth continent, quality of life, substance use, and PHQ-9. Multiple logistic regression models revealed groups again differed significantly for substance use, PHQ-9 score, VACS index, and head injury. Random forest (RF) models disclosed that classification algorithms distinguished HAND from NN and NCI-OD from NN with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.87 and 0.77, respectively. Relative importance plots derived from the RF model exhibited distinct variable rankings that were predictive of NCI status for both NN versus HAND and NN versus NCI-OD comparisons. Thus, NCI was frequently detected (33.5%) although HAND prevalence (21%) was lower than in several earlier reports underscoring the potential contribution of other factors to NCI.

Adolescent chronic pain is a growing epidemic. It is unknown why some adolescents recover without incident and others experience persistent pain. Although unexplored, early life adversity may contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. This study investigated the effects and underlying neurobiological mechanisms of an early life stressor on nociceptive (pain) sensitivity and emotional function in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Using maternal separation (MS) as an established model of early life stress, we addressed two aims: investigation of the effects of MS on behavior (anxiety and pain sensitivity), and investigation of the effects of MS on mRNA and pathophysiological changes associated with an acutely painful stimulus. Our results indicate that MS increased anxiety-like behavior and altered nociceptive responsivity in adolescent rats, with decreased mechanical withdrawal thresholds indicative of heightened and prolonged pain-related behavior. The MS groups also demonstrated increased expression of genes involved in regulating the stress and fight-or-flight response, mood, and neuroplasticity; as well as increased levels of inflammatory markers. We conclude that nociception, both at the behavioral and molecular level, is altered in response to the MS stressor.",2020-04-01,Developmental Psychobiology,https://openalex.org/V119146558,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21922,,,,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977289111,https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21922,journal-article,2977289111

It is found that as the fractional exponent decreases, the weight of the voltage memory trace that results from the contribution of past voltage activity increases, and thus the measured response of the device at any time is increasingly correlated to its past.

(when stakes are higher): Understanding how the overclaiming technique can be used to measure faking in personnel selection.,"Overclaiming questionnaires (OCQs), which capture overclaiming behavior, or exaggerating one's knowledge about a given topic, have been proposed as potentially indicative of faking behaviors that plague self-report assessments in job application settings. The empirical evidence on the efficacy of OCQs in this respect is inconsistent, however. We draw from expectancy theory to reconcile these inconsistencies and identify the conditions under which overclaiming behavior will be most indicative of faking. We propose that the assessment context must be tied to an outcome with high valence, and that the content of the OCQ must match the perceived knowledge requirements of the target job, such that overclaiming knowledge of that content will be instrumental to receiving a job offer. We test these propositions through three studies. First, in a sample of 51 applicants to firefighter positions, we demonstrate that overclaiming on a job-relevant OCQ is positively associated with other indicators of faking and self-presentation. Next, we demonstrate through a repeated-measures experiment (N = 252) that participants in a simulated personnel selection setting overclaim more knowledge on a job-relevant OCQ than on a job-irrelevant OCQ, compared with when they are instructed to respond honestly. Finally, in a novel repeated-measures personnel selection paradigm (N = 259), we observed more overclaiming during a selection assessment compared with a research assessment, and we observed that this job-application overclaiming behavior predicted deviant behavior following selection. Altogether, the results show that overclaiming behavior is most indicative of faking in job application assessments when an OCQ contains job-relevant (rather than job-irrelevant) content.

In previous work, the satellite-and-station-specific slant total electron content (STEC) ionospheric corrections, derived from a regional reference network, are commonly used to augment single-frequency PPP for improving positioning accuracy and faster convergence. However, since the users are required to interpolate STEC ionospheric corrections from nearby reference stations, either duplex communication links should be established or all corrections of the reference network must be retrieved, which makes it inefficient to provide augmentation services to many users. Moreover, the regional tropospheric corrections are generally neglected in augmenting real-time single-frequency PPP. In this study, we present a method to estimate and represent tropospheric and ionospheric corrections from a regional reference network, which can be efficiently disseminated to users through a simplex communication link. First, the uncombined dual-frequency PPP, with external ionospheric constraints derived from international GNSS service predicted global ionospheric map, is used for estimating atmospheric delays with observations from a regional GNSS reference network. Then, the atmospheric delays are properly represented to facilitate real-time transmission by applying a polynomial model for the representation of zenith wet tropospheric corrections, and satellite-specific STEC maps for representing the slant ionospheric corrections. The above results in only simple communication links required to retrieve the regional atmospheric corrections for real-time single-frequency PPP augmentation. Observations from a regional network of 30 GNSS reference stations with inter-station distances of about 70 km during a 1-week-long period, including both quiet and active geomagnetic conditions, are used for generating the regional atmospheric corrections. The results indicate that the average root-mean-square errors of the obtained regional tropospheric and ionospheric corrections are better than 0.01 and 0.05 m when compared with those derived from dual-frequency uncombined PPP, respectively. The positioning accuracy of the single-frequency PPP augmented with regional atmospheric corrections is at 0.141 m horizontally and 0.206 m vertically under a 95% confidence level, a significant improvement compared to single-frequency PPP without atmospheric augmentation. The convergence time is also significantly reduced with 70.4% of the positioning sessions achieving instantaneous 3D convergence.",2020-01-01,Gps Solutions,https://openalex.org/V173595373,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-019-0920-5,,,24,1,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987778384,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-019-0920-5,journal-article,2987778384

These structures have a fundamental role in the development of immunothrombosis; a physiological process mediated by immune cells and molecules from the coagulation system that facilitates the recognition, containment, and destruction of pathogens. Although NETs and immunothrombi are widely hypothesized to be key host defense responses responsible for limiting bacterial dissemination, their actual role in this process has not been formally assessed within the context of a bloodstream infection. Mice were first treated with LPS to generate inflammation (NETs and immunothrombi) and then bacteria dissemination was analyzed by intravital microscopy and colony-forming units (CFU) assay. Blocking NETs or coagulation by the administration of DNase or Argatroban (thrombin inhibitor), respectively, did not modify the percentage of bacteria capture by Kupffer cells, neutrophils or platelets. Moreover, both inhibitors reduced the number of bacteria in the spleen, without modifying CFUs in the liver or lung.

In Parkinson disease (PD), gait impairments often coexist with nonmotor symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Biofeedback training may improve gait function in PD, but its effect on nonmotor symptoms remains unclear. This study explored the cognitive and global effects of Ambulosono, a cognitive gait training method utilizing step size to contingently control the real-time play of motivational music. Objective. This study examined the feasibility of music-contingent gait training and its effects on neuropsychological test performance and mood in persons with PD. Methods. A total of 3 participants with mild to moderate PD were semirandomized via sequential alternating assignment into an experimental training group or control music group. The training group received 12 weeks of music-contingent training, whereby music play was dependent on the user achieving a set stride length, adjusted online based on individual performance. The control group received hybrid training beginning with 6 weeks of noncontingent music walking, whereby music played continuously regardless of step size, followed by 6 weeks of music-contingent training. Global cognition, memory, executive function, attention, and working memory assessments were completed by blinded assessors at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Motor function, mood, and anxiety were assessed. Results. Average training adherence was 97%, with no falls occurring during training sessions. Improvements on cognitive measures were not clinically significant; however, significant decreases in depression and anxiety were observed in both groups over time ( P &lt; .05). Conclusions.

The National Hockey League (NHL) has conducted baseline neuropsychological assessment of all players since 1997. This study seeks to examine baseline differences among linguistically and culturally diverse groups within the NHL and to present comprehensive normative data for these groups. Method Baseline data were obtained from 3,145 professional hockey players’ baseline symptom reporting, neuropsychological test performance on a battery of traditional “paper and pencil” measures, and self-reported concussion history. In addition, 604 baseline post-injury paper and pencil evaluations were conducted the season following a concussion and 4,780 computerized baseline ImPACT administrations were obtained following the introduction of computerized testing. Results Normative data for paper and pencil tests and ImPACT are presented for the major language groups within the league: English, French, Swedish, Russian, Czech, Finnish, and German (ImPACT only). It was found that symptom reporting, the number of concussions sustained, and neuropsychological test results vary significantly based on a players’ language of origin. This variability was also present when players were tested in their language of origin. Conclusions This study provides insight into the significant baseline differences that exist among NHL players regarding symptoms, concussion history, and cognitive functioning.

FSGS can be observed with various underlying causes, including highly penetrant monogenic renal disease. We recently identified pathogenic variants of UMOD, a gene encoding the tubular protein uromodulin, in 8 families with suspected glomerular disease.To validate pathogenic variants of UMOD, we reviewed the clinical and pathology reports of members of 8 families identified to have variants of UMOD. Clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data were collected, and genetic confirmation for UMOD was performed by Sanger sequencing.Biopsy-proven cases of FSGS were verified in 21% (7 of 34) of patients with UMOD variants. The UMOD variants seen in  families were mutations previously reported in autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-uromodulin (ADTKD-UMOD).

This post-trial follow-up examined outcomes in gambling expenditure over 12 months.

DESIGN: Observational study following a three-arm randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Customers of Norsk Tipping (NT) gambling platforms, Norway.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 100 statistical triplets from the top 0.5% of customers based upon annual expenditure, matched on sex, age and net losses. Mean age was 53.4 years; 19% were women, mean yearly loss for 201 was 88 197 NoK. Interventions and comparator Feedback intervention by telephone, letter or a no-contact control condition.

MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measure was gambling theoretical loss, derived from the NT customer database. Secondary outcomes were responsible gambling customer actions and whether or not the participant was retained as an NT customer.

FINDINGS: Per-protocol analyses of triplets who received the telephone call or letter as randomly assigned (n = 596) showed a positive and sustained effect over 12 months: the telephone group showed a 30% reduction in theoretical loss (d = 0.44) and the letter group 13% (d = 0.18), both outperforming the control group with a 7% reduction (d = 0.11). The telephone condition was superior to both the letter and control conditions in per-protocol (P < 0.001) and to control condition in intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) (P < 0.001). Individuals in the telephone condition took more responsible gambling actions. The letter condition had better outcomes than the control in the ITT-only analysis (P < 0.001). More than 93% were still customers a year after the intervention.

The goal of this exploratory study was to determine the association between functional connectivity and the different symptom domains of TS, as little is currently known about how they differ. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 3 patients with TS and 2 matched healthy controls. Seed-based functional connectivity of the supplementary motor area (SMA), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, caudate and putamen were compared between the groups, and correlated with clinical measures within the patient group. When compared to controls, patients with TS exhibited greater connectivity between the temporal gyri, insula and putamen, and between the OFC and cingulate cortex. Tic severity was associated with greater connectivity between the putamen and the sensorimotor cortex; OCS severity was associated with less connectivity between the SMA and thalamus and between the caudate and precuneus; and premonitory urge severity was associated with less connectivity between the OFC and sensorimotor cortex and between the inferior frontal gyrus and the putamen and insula seeds.

Duodenoscopes are specialized endoscopes used to perform ERCP, and inherent to their design, a high rate of persistent bacterial contamination exists even after automated reprocessing and disinfection. Consequently, in recent years, ERCP has been associated with infection transmission, leading to several fatal patient outbreaks. Due to increasing fears over widespread future duodenoscope-related outbreaks, regulatory bodies have called for alterations in the design of duodenoscopes. A duodenoscope has recently been developed that employs a disposable cap. This novel design theoretically eliminates the mechanism behind persistent bacterial contamination and infection transmission. However, there are no data demonstrating persistent bacterial contamination rates, technical success rates, or clinical outcomes associated with these duodenoscopes. Methods A parallel arm randomized controlled trial will be performed for which 520 patients will be recruited. The study population will consist of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP procedures for any indication at a high-volume tertiary care centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Patients will be randomized to an intervention group, that will undergo ERCP with a novel duodenoscope with disposable cap, or to a control group who will undergo ERCP with a traditional duodenoscope. Co-primary outcomes will include persistent bacterial contamination rates (post automated reprocessing) and ERCP technical success rates. Secondary outcomes include clinical success rates, overall and specific early and late adverse event rates, 30-day mortality and healthcare utilization rates, procedure and reprocessing times, and ease of device use. Discussion The ICECAP trial will answer important questions regarding the use of a novel duodenoscope with disposable cap. Specifically, persistent bacterial contamination, technical performance, and relevant clinical outcomes will be assessed. Given the mortality and morbidity burden associated with ERCP-related infectious outbreaks, the results of this study have the capacity to be impactful at an international level.

However, the biological significance of HBV genomes within lymphoid cells (i.e., peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) is unclear. Here, we collected available plasma, PBMC, liver, and tumor from 52 chronic HBV (CHB) carriers: 3 with HCC, 1 without HCC, and one with dendritic cell sarcoma, DCS. Using highly sensitive sequencing techniques, next generation sequencing, and AluPCR, we demonstrate that viral genomes (i.e., HBV DNA, RNA, and cccDNA), oncogenic variants, and HBV-host integration are often found in all sample types collected from 52 patients (including lymphoid cells and a DCS tumor). Viral integration was recurrently identified (n = 90 such hits) in genes associated with oncogenic consequences in lymphoid and liver cells. Further, HBV genomes increased in PBMCs derived from  additional (treated or untreated) CHB carriers after extracellular mitogen stimulation.

Impacts of emulsion droplet size on promoting crossflow between the two permeability zones were investigated. Emulsion flood pattern and outflow percentage from the two heterogeneous zones show that injection of O/W emulsions with an appropriate range of droplet sizes can induce crossflows between the two permeability zones, thereby resulting in the water mobility conformance in the heterogeneous 2-D model. Two types of crossflow were observed in the experiments and verified in the numerical modeling: flow redistribution at the injection boundary and crossflows in the emulsion-invaded area. A new mathematical model was established to capture the dynamics of 2-D emulsion flow. A finite element method was used to obtain the solution of the mathematical model, and the experimentally observed emulsion conformance control processes were successfully predicted. Mathematical analyses on emulsion concentration distribution, velocity field and pressure distribution reveal that it is the capillary resistance contributed by the emulsion that changes the pressure distribution in the two permeability zones; therefore, the changed pressure distribution affects the local flow in the two permeability zone and thus influences the outflows. The proposed emulsion flow model is compatible with a standard reservoir simulator, providing a potentially efficient and useful method of simulating field-scale emulsion flow for designing conformance control process.",2020-08-01,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117751,117751,117751,273,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015261822,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117751,journal-article,3015261822

The hierarchical clustering is performed on unorganized point clouds based on a proximity matrix that consists of a distance term and a direction term. In the dissimilarity calculation of two clusters, a pair of points from each of two clusters is selected, respectively, and Euclidean distances between the points are employed to define the distance term. The direction term is obtained by the differences of normal vectors at chosen points. The main contribution is that the cluster combination in the hierarchical clustering is optimized by a point-based graph model. The cluster combination is formulated as a problem of matching, optimized by finding the minimum-cost perfect matching in a bipartite graph. The results show that the proposed hierarchical clustering method succeeds in segmenting object from point clouds without any human–computer interaction and outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation approaches in terms of completeness and correctness.",2020-07-01,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,https://openalex.org/V144771191,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2912455,,,,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2767894093,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2912455,journal-article,2767894093

This can be done in a subject-specific manner using finite element (FE) modeling, but care is needed to ensure that modeling assumptions reflect the in vivo environment. Here, we explored the influence of loading and boundary conditions (BC), and compared predictions to previous in vivo measurements. Data were collected from a female participant who walked/ran on an instrumented treadmill while motion data were captured. Inverse dynamics of the leg (foot, shank, and thigh segments) was combined with a musculoskeletal (MSK) model to estimate muscle and joint contact forces. These forces were applied to an FE model of the tibia, generated from computed tomography (CT). Eight conditions varying loading/BCs were investigated. We found that modeling the fibula was necessary to predict realistic tibia bending. Applying joint moments from the MSK model to the FE model was also needed to predict torsional deformation. During walking, the most complex model predicted deformation of 0.5 deg posterior, 0. deg medial, and 1.4 deg internal rotation, comparable to in vivo measurements of 0.5–1 deg, 0.15–0.7 deg, and 0.75–2.2 deg, respectively. During running, predicted deformations of 0.3 deg posterior, 0.3 deg medial, and 0.5 deg internal rotation somewhat underestimated in vivo measures of 0.85–1.9 deg, 0.3–0.9 deg, 0.65–1.72 deg, respectively.

Here we revisit the formalism and, in particular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation which were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is only one notion of differentiation. This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular interest is the observation that—somewhat counter-intuitively—differential algebras never induce a differential category although they provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota–Baxter algebras—which are usually associated with integration—provide an example of a differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.",2020-04-01,Applied Categorical Structures,https://openalex.org/V148906134,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10485-019-09572-y,171,235,28,2,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2963062026,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10485-019-09572-y,journal-article,2963062026

Cerebral blood flow data were acquired using the pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling technique. Baseline OEF and CMRO were calculated using QSM and cerebral blood flow measurements.

This study examined the effects of task prioritization on overground and treadmill dual-task walking.Twenty-two adults walked overground and on a treadmill under three dual-task conditions: prioritization of walking performance, prioritization of cognitive performance (serial subtraction in sevens), or no prioritization.Compared to single-task walking, stride velocity was reduced and stride time variability was increased during dual-task overground walking. During treadmill walking, there was no dual-task effect on walking performance, but cognitive task performance was improved. Prioritization of the cognitive task reduced the dual-task effect on stride velocity during overground walking only, whilst prioritization of the walking task reduced cognitive task performance in both walking modalities.These results corroborate recent findings that the dual-task effects on treadmill walking are not equivalent to those on overground walking. Healthy adults appear to prioritize cognitive task performance during treadmill dual-task walking without detrimental effects to gait. During overground walking however, allocation of attention to the secondary task reduces gait performance. These results indicate that treadmill based dual-task paradigms should not be used to infer factors which influence the cognitive control of overground walking.",2020-01-01,Gait & Posture,https://openalex.org/V156006901,Elsevier,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31669806/,109,114,75,,,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2967982592,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.08.007,journal-article,2967982592

Gas sorption-induced strains in the three principal directions were studied to examine the anisotropic deformation. The results show that the coal sample can be treated as isotropic in those planes parallel to the bedding direction. However, the strong strain anisotropy of coal indicates that the gas sorption-induced matrix strain in the direction parallel to the bedding is smaller than that which is perpendicular to the bedding, under different hydrostatic pressures for unconstrained conditions. Permeability measurements were conducted under different effective stresses to determine the magnitude and orientation of directional permeability. It was found that cleat distribution plays a dominant role in the magnitude of the measured permeability. After the two principal permeabilities parallel to the bedding planes are calculated, Mohr’s circle of permeability can be then determined and used to estimate permeability in other directions of the bedding. The experimental results show that the principal permeability directions vary under different effective stresses, illustrating that coal cleat system would be reoriented during gas production. It was also found that cleat reorientation is attributed to three factors: stress contrast, the difference of Biot’s coefficient, and the difference in the sorption-induced stresses in the direction perpendicular to and parallel to the bedding planes. However, cleat reorientation had little influence on changes in the magnitude of coal permeability. Permeability anisotropy degree between the three principal directions varies dynamically under different effective stresses, and then possibly changes direction of gas flow. This study demonstrates that stress-dependent coal anisotropy should be considered for simulating gas flow behavior and predicting coalbed methane production.",2020-02-01,Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering,https://openalex.org/V39260535,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00603-019-01932-3,625,639,53,2,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968042183,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00603-019-01932-3,journal-article,2968042183

Four conditions of emulsion flow in porous media were observed, identified, and discussed, in terms of the capillary number. A general model for the pressure drop versus flow rate based on the bi-viscosity model was developed from a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data. This model expresses that the flow of emulsion in porous media has two distinct mobility in porous media demarcated by a critical pressure drop. The inverse of the mobility is determined as consistency parameter and the critical pressure drop as the yield pressure drop.

The newly proposed model has a good agreement between the predicted and experimental plugging pressure drop of emulsion.

Thereby, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a one-carbon cycle nutraceutical compound with a favourable side effect profile, has a theoretical rationale for efficacy. However, further controlled studies are required to confirm SAMe's efficacy.To test the efficacy of SAMe versus placebo in unmedicated DSM-5 diagnosed (major depressive disorder) (MDD) patients with mild-to-moderate levels of depressive symptoms.We conducted an 8-week, double-blind, randomised controlled trial testing 80 mg/day of SAMe monotherapy versus placebo in 4 patients with MDD (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score 14-25) who were not currently taking antidepressants. One-carbon cycle biomarkers, brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), and relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed as potential treatment moderators.A clinically relevant differential reduction from baseline to week  of 3.76 points occurred on the primary outcome (MADRS) in favour of SAMe. This however was not significant (p = 0.13) on an adjusted linear mixed model, notwithstanding a medium to large effect size of 0.72. A high placebo response rate of 53% occurred (> 50% reduction on MADRS). Exploratory analyses showed that SAMe was however effective in reducing depression amongst participants with milder depression severity (MADRS ≤ 22, p = 0.045). Response was not moderated by BDNF, SNPs, or one-carbon cycle biomarkers, although increased folate concentrations were correlated with improved symptoms in the SAMe group (r = - 0.57, p = 0.026).

Our aim is to explicate, using IE's theoretical ontology and analytical tools, how troubling patient experiences in this clinical context are coordinated institutionally. We focus our attention on the social organisation of healthcare professionals' knowledge and front-line practices, highlighting the textual processes through which they overrule patients' concerns and uncertainties about taking preventative medication, such that some patients feel unable to openly discuss their health needs in preventative consultations. We show how healthcare professionals activate knowledge of 'evidence-based risk reduction' to frame patients' queries as 'barriers' to be overcome.

One way to demonstrate empathy is through the use of non-verbal communication (NVC) including touch. To date, research on NVC, and specifically touch, has been relatively limited in medicine, which is surprising given the central role it plays in conveying affective and empathic messages. To inform curriculum development on NVC, this study aimed to examine physicians' experiences of communicating by touch.We conducted an interpretative phenomenological study. A total of 15 physicians (seven women and eight men) from different specialties, including both recent graduates and experienced doctors, described in detail specific instances of touch drawn from their clinical practices. Interview prompts encouraged participants to recall exact details such as the context, their relationship with the patient they touched and their physical experience of touching. Interviews (45-100 minutes) were analysed with template analysis, followed by a process of dialectic questioning, moving back and forth between the data and researchers' personal reflections on them, drawing on phenomenological literature to synthesise a final interpretation.Participants described two dimensions of the experience of touch: 'choosing and inviting touch' and 'expressing empathy.' Touch was a personal and fragile process. Participants interpreted non-verbal patient cues in order to determine whether or not touch was appropriate. They interpreted facial expressions and body language in the present to make meaning of patients' experiences. They used touch to share emotions, and to demonstrate empathy and presence. Participants' experiences of touch framed it as a form of embodied empathic communication.Touch is a powerful form of NVC that can establish human connection.

In addition to evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma, ultrasound is used for assessment of the gallbladder, biliary tree, peripancreatic tissues, and regional vascular structures. While enlarged and edematous pancreas are classic sonographic features of acute pancreatitis, the pancreas may appear sonographically normal in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Nonetheless, sonographic evaluation in this setting is valuable because assessment for etiologic factors such as gallstones or evidence of biliary obstruction are best performed with ultrasound. Complications of pancreatitis such as peripancreatic fluid collections, venous thrombosis, or arterial pseudoaneurysm can be identified with careful and focused ultrasound examination. Knowledge of various scanning techniques can help to mitigate some of the commonly encountered barriers to sonographic visualization of the pancreas and right upper quadrant structures.

We tested the susceptibility of iso- and cycloalkanes to methanogenic biodegradation by incubating them with mature fine tailings (MFT) collected from two depths (6 and 3 m below surface) of a tailings pond, representing different lengths of exposure to hydrocarbons. A mixture of five iso-alkanes and three cycloalkanes was incubated with MFT for 170 d. Iso-alkanes were completely biodegraded in the order 3-methylhexane > 4-methylheptane > 2-methyloctane > 2-methylheptane, whereas 3-ethylhexane and ethylcyclopentane were only partially depleted and methylcyclohexane and ethylcyclohexane were not degraded during incubation. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed enrichment of Peptococcaceae (Desulfotomaculum) and Smithella in amended cultures with acetoclastic (Methanosaeta) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanoregula and Methanoculleus). Bioaugmentation of MFT by inoculation with MFT-derived enrichment cultures reduced the lag phase before onset of iso-alkane and cycloalkane degradation. However, the same enrichment culture incubated without MFT exhibited slower biodegradation kinetics and less CH4 production, implying that the MFT solid phase (clay minerals) enhanced methanogenesis.

Compared with standard Rock-Eval pyrolysis on OIP estimation, the MIS pyrolysis provides more specific information concerning gross compositions and physical status of oils, which reduces the impact of the frequently-occurred carryover effect to a certain extent. Systematic variations of molecular compositions especially the light vs. heavy n-alkanes have been elucidated. The mobile oil estimated from MIS pyrolysates is very close to solvent extractable oils (i.e., bitumen).

Bitumen recovery process using EMH technique assisted by solvent injection, such as that used in Enhanced Solvent Extraction Incorporating Electromagnetic Heating (ESEIEH®) pilot in currently being conducted in the Athabasca oil sands, utilizes radiofrequency waves to generate a moderate amount of heat in the reservoir. In conjunction with dilution effect of solvent the generated thermal energy reduces the viscosity of highly viscous bitumen leading to its mobilization. Electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in a reservoir is a coupled multiphysics process that involves not only the heat transfer and fluid flow, but also EM field distribution. Currently, a coupled approach is followed by industry using a commercial reservoir simulator (CMG-STARS) and another commercial software (ANSYS-HFSS) or in-house electromagnetic wave solver with different gridding system where both are linked through a property mapping interface (CEMRS or AxHeat). The coupled scheme utilizes the interface to map parameters from two different gridding structures which causes an additional computational load on the simulation process and could be a source of error. This study presents an alternative integrated compositional numerical modeling approach to explore the EM heating phenomena pertinent to fluid flow and heat generation and transfer in oil sand reservoirs in the same grid structure. Energy balance and EM wave propagation are derived using Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. Then, the newly developed numerical simulator is validated using benchmark problems and used to demonstrate the physics of EM-induced volumetric heat generation in multi-phase oil sand reservoirs. Finally, the developed numerical model is applied in a case study of propane injection along the antenna to achieve oil recovery and the results are compared with the analogous Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD).",2020-04-01,International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer,https://openalex.org/V90999920,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119393,119393,119393,151,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001468735,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119393,journal-article,3001468735

Previous studies reported increased levels of proteolytic activity in stool and tissue samples from IBD patients, whereas the re-establishment of the proteolytic balance abrogates the development of experimental colitis. Furthermore, recent data suggest that IBD occurs in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an abnormal immune response to intestinal microbes once exposed to environmental triggers. In this review, we highlight the role of proteases in IBD pathophysiology, and we showcase how the main cellular pathways associated with IBD influence proteolytic unbalance and how functional proteomics are allowing the unambiguous identification of dysregulated proteases in IBD, paving the way to the development of new protease inhibitors as a new potential treatment.",2020-09-07,Journal of Crohn's and Colitis,https://openalex.org/V2735960814,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa033,1149,1161,14,8,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007903464,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa033,journal-article,3007903464

The postoperative period includes numerous interventions, including fluid administration and transfusion of blood products, medication use (including heparin), and increased risk of organ dysfunction and infection. Understanding normal thrombopoietin physiology and the associated expected postoperative platelet count changes is the crucial first step in evaluation. Timing of thrombocytopenia is the most important feature when differentiating causes of postoperative thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia within  days of surgery is commonly caused by hemodilution and increased perioperative platelet consumption prior to thrombopoietin-induced platelet count recovery and transient platelet count overshoot. A much broader list of possible conditions that can cause late-onset thrombocytopenia (postoperative day  [POD5] or later) is generally divided into consumptive and destructive causes. The former includes common (eg, infection-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation) and rare (eg, postoperative thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) conditions, whereas the latter includes such entities as drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia or posttransfusion purpura. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a unique entity associated with thrombosis that is typically related to intraoperative/perioperative heparin exposure, although it can develop following knee replacement surgery even in the absence of heparin exposure. Very late onset (POD10 or later) of thrombocytopenia can indicate bacterial or fungal infection. Lastly, thrombocytopenia after mechanical device implantation requires unique considerations.

While various codes and methods have been developed, none of them focuses on overlapped corrosion defects, especially the investigation of local mechanical-chemical interaction at the overlapped defects. In this work, a finite element-based multi-physics one-way coupling model was developed to simulate and determine the mechano-electrochemical (M-E) interaction at overlapped corrosion defects on an X46 steel pipeline. It is found that the presence of overlapped corrosion defects results in a local stress concentration and enhanced M-E interaction effect on corrosion defect growth. The maximum stress always generates at the corner of the bottom defect. The enhanced M-E interaction causes an accelerated corrosion at the bottom defect, resulting in the rapid defect growth to cause pipeline leaking. The geometry of corrosion defects, especially the defect depth and length, affects local stress concentration and the M-E interaction. With the increasing length and depth of either top or bottom corrosion defects, the overall stress level increases, but the effect is more apparent at the bottom defect. Similarly, the increased M-E interaction due to the increasing length and depth of the corrosion defects results in a more accelerated corrosion at the bottom defect than the top one.",2020-06-01,Engineering Structures,https://openalex.org/V165454098,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110466,,,,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010892983,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110466,journal-article,3010892983

The airway epithelium is the primary site of HRV infection, and responds by releasing proinflammatory and antimicrobial cytokines. Epithelial cells release IL-17C in response to exposure to bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. We previously demonstrated a role for HRV in IL-17C production from undifferentiated epithelial cells, and showed that IL-17C could play a role in neutrophil recruitment. To extend these observations, highly differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) were infected apically with HRV to assess the effect of dose, time, viral replication, and strain on the IL-17C response. Cellular lysates, and basolateral and apical secretions were analyzed for IL-17C and CXCL1 protein release following HRV or IL-17C stimulation. Upon HRV infection, IL-17C protein was exclusively released basolaterally in a dose-, time-, and viral replication-dependent manner. Several strains of rhinovirus were capable of inducing IL-17C release. Enriched columnar epithelial cell populations contained significantly higher viral titer, and expressed significantly more IL-17C mRNA than enriched basal cell populations. In addition, the kinetic profile of IL-17C release following HRV treatment closely mimics viral shedding kinetics, further implicating the role of rhinovirus replication in IL-17C production. Basolateral treatment of HBEs with IL-17C resulted in a dose-dependent increase in basolateral CXCL1 production. In summary, replicating rhinovirus drives basolateral IL-17C protein release from both apical and basal epithelial cells, which may then act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote basolateral CXCL1 protein release.",2020-03-13,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,https://openalex.org/V2506667490,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00103,,,10,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012100765,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00103,journal-article,3012100765

These peripheral sensations are crucial for all types of behaviors, ranging from social interaction to danger avoidance. Somatosensory information is transmitted from primary afferent fibers in the periphery into the central nervous system via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal horn functions as an intermediary processing center for this information, comprising a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons as well as projection neurons that transmit the processed somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the brain. It is now known that there can be dysfunction within this spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain conditions and that these perturbations contribute to the development and maintenance of pathological pain. However, the complex and heterogeneous network of the spinal dorsal horn has hampered efforts to further elucidate its role in somatosensory processing. Emerging optical techniques promise to illuminate the underlying organization and function of the dorsal horn and provide insights into the role of spinal cord sensory processing in shaping the behavioral response to somatosensory input that we ultimately observe.

We assessed both the product and process of children's interpretations to test whether children's processing of ironic remarks is better explained by sequential or interactive accounts of irony processing. Children (aged 5–8 years) viewed puppet shows in which the speaker and addressee were described either as siblings or as new acquaintances and the speaker made either an ironic or a literal remark. Using a variant of the visual world paradigm, participants were trained to make a motor response, selecting a response object to indicate whether they thought the speaker had a literal or an ironic intention. The timing of children's motor responses and their eye gaze to the response objects were tracked and analyzed. Results showed that sibling relationship information did not impact the accuracy of children's speaker intent judgments, but facilitated children's responding in the earliest stages of processing.

Data from the All Our Families longitudinal birth cohort was used to assess women’s perceived social support during their second trimester, third trimester, and at 4-month postpartum (n = 3387). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine the number of groups, shape of trajectories, and proportion of women with differing trajectories. Multinomial regression was used to compare probability of group membership. Six distinct trajectory groups were identified, with the majority of participants belonging to groups with stable, high social support (60.6%). Only 2.7% of women had consistently low levels of social support, and 2.3% had rising levels. Membership in groups with lower levels of social support was associated with lower incomes and minority ethnicity. Women whose support improved over time may be more likely to be employed in pregnancy than those whose support remained low.

Multiple studies have evaluated nutritional screening tools (NSTs, rapid bedside tests targeting who needs assessment) and nutritional assessment tools (NATs, used in diagnosing malnutrition) as predictors of clinical outcome in this population. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of this literature with the aim of summarising the varying definitions of malnutrition across studies, the available evidence for NSTs and the ability of NSTs and NATs to predict clinical outcomes in cirrhosis. Methods The primary outcome measures were pre- and post-transplant mortality with a range of secondary outcomes. Inclusion: cirrhosis over age 16. Exclusion: >25% with hepatocellular carcinoma, primarily laboratory test-based NATs or lack of screening, assessment or outcome criteria. Results Eight thousand eight hundred fifty patients were included across 4 studies. Only  studies assessed NSTs. Thirty-two definitions for malnutrition were utilised across studies. NATs predicted pre-transplant mortality in 69% of cases that were assessed with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.38 (95% CI 1.96-2.89). NATs were prognostic for post-transplant mortality only 28% of the times they were assessed, with a RR of 3.04 (95% CI 1.51-6.12). Conclusions The cirrhosis literature includes limited data on nutrition screening and multiple definitions for what constitutes malnutrition using NATs.

The steam-based heating methods are primarily used by the oil industry for the heavy oil/bitumen recovery. However, the thermal recovery methods are energy-intensive and have limited applications, especially for both thin and deep reservoirs. Therefore, there is a high priority need to investigate alternative approaches. To date, the most progressive alternative technique that has proven its potential during pilot-plant tests is nanocatalytic in-situ heavy oil/bitumen upgrading via hot-fluid injection. Hence, the continual improvement of this technique is of utmost importance. This study aims to propose a new injecting nanofluid system suitable for high-temperature injection into the reservoir with consecutive heavy oil/bitumen upgrading and recovery. Here we report a new type of copper-based nanofluid using a blend of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and vacuum residue (VR) as the mother solvent. The nanoparticles were prepared by low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis route. Their detailed surface, morphology and size characterizations were achieved by X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. The stable nanofluids were prepared by dispersing copper-based nanoparticles in a mixture of VGO and VR, at different ratios and temperatures. A set of measurements to determine the thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluid with different loading of nanoparticle were performed. The thermal conductivity values of nanofluid systems are substantially higher than that of the base fluids. The nanofluid for 2 wt% of copper-doped aegirine nanoparticles dispersed in VGO and VGO/VR mixture exhibits a maximum thermal conductivity of 20% and 24%, respectively. It was found that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids increases with decreasing the hydrodynamic particle size. Moreover, the presence of chemo-physical interactions between nanoparticles and base fluid further enhances the thermal conductivity. Also, the temperature augmentation in a range from 80 to 110 °C exhibited a positive effect on thermal conductivity enhancement of vacuum residue-based nanofluid system. This particular nanofluid may find potential applications in enhancing heavy oil upgrading and recovery.",2020-02-01,Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,https://openalex.org/V19016632,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106569,106569,106569,185,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980141913,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106569,journal-article,2980141913

However, changes in these properties are not known at a very early time point after ACL rupture, but recognizing early changes might be crucial for successful intervention. We investigated the effects of ACL transection (ACLT) in rabbits on the site-specific biomechanical properties of articular cartilage and chondrocytes, FCD content and collagen network organization, two weeks post-surgery. Unilateral ACLT was performed in eight rabbits, and femoral condyles, tibial plateaus, femoral grooves and patellae were harvested from experimental and contralateral knee joints. An intact control group was used as a reference. We analyzed chondrocyte morphology under pre- and static loading, cartilage biomechanical properties, FCD content and collagen fibril orientation. ACLT caused FCD loss in the lateral and medial femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau, femoral groove and patellar cartilage (p < 0.05). Minor changes in the collagen orientation occurred in the femoral groove and lateral and medial femoral condyle cartilage (p < 0.05).

Telemonitoring (TM) for HF management has been found to reduce mortality risk and hospital readmissions if implemented appropriately; however, the impact of TM targeted for patients recently discharged from hospital, for whom TM might have the biggest benefit, is still unknown. Medly, a mobile phone–based TM system that is currently being used as a standard of care for HF at a large Canadian hospital, may be an effective tool for the management of HF in patients recently discharged from hospital. Objective The objective of the Medly-After an Incidence of acute Decompensation (Medly-AID) trial is to determine the effect of Medly on the self-care and quality of life of patients with HF who have been recently discharged from hospital after an HF-related decompensation. Methods A multisite multimethod randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at 2 academic hospitals and at least one community hospital to evaluate the impact of Medly-enabled HF management on the outcomes of patients with HF who had been hospitalized for HF-related decompensation and discharged during the 2 weeks before recruitment. The trial will include 14 participants with HF (7 in each control and intervention groups). Control patients will receive standard of care, whereas patients in the intervention group will receive standard of care and Medly. Specifically, patients in the intervention group will record daily weight, blood pressure, and heart rate and answer symptom-related questions via the Medly app. Medly will generate automated patient self-care messages such as to adjust diuretic medications, based on the rules-based algorithm personalized to the individual patient, and send real-time alerts to their health care providers as necessary. All patients will be followed for  months. Primary outcome measures are self-care and quality of life as measured through the validated questionnaires Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, EQ-5D-5L, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12. Secondary outcome measures for this study include cost of health care services used and health outcomes. Results Patient recruitment began in November 201 at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, with a total of 3 participants recruited by July 30, 201 (1 in the intervention group and 1 in the control group). The final analysis is expected to occur in the fall of 2020. Conclusions This RCT will be the first to assess the effectiveness of the Medly TM system for use following discharge from hospital after a HF-related decompensation.

These endospores are likely expelled from warm subsurface environments and subsequently dispersed by ocean currents. The endospore upper temperature limit for survival is 140°C, which can be tolerated in repeated short exposures, potentially enabling transit through hot crustal fluids. Longer-term thermal tolerance of endospores, and how long they could persist in an environment hotter than their maximum growth temperature, is less understood. To test whether thermophilic endospores can survive prolonged exposure to high temperatures, sediments were incubated at 80-90°C for 6, 1 or 46 days. Sediments were then cooled by 10-40°C, mimicking the cooling in subsurface oil reservoirs subjected to seawater injection. Cooling the sediments induced sulfate reduction, coinciding with an enrichment of endospore-forming Clostridia. Different Desulfofundulus, Desulfohalotomaculum, Desulfallas, Desulfotomaculum and Desulfofarcimen demonstrated different thermal tolerances, with some Desulfofundulus strains surviving for >1 year at 80°C. In an oil reservoir context, heat-resistant endospore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria have a survival advantage if they are introduced to, or are resident in, an oil reservoir normally too hot for germination and growth, explaining observations of reservoir souring following cold seawater injection.",2020-01-01,Environmental Microbiology,https://openalex.org/V6919857,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14866,456,465,22,1,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989679178,https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14866,journal-article,2989679178

Women who had ≥2 consecutive medications prescription for maintenance therapy for IBD in the year prior to pregnancy were included (n = 230). Prescription-based medication possession ratio ≥0.8 defined adherence. Chi-squared tests were used to compare adherence patterns by drug class and outcomes.Of the 159/230 women who were adherent during the year prior to pregnancy, 2 (12.6%; 95% CI: 8.2%, 18.8%) were not adherent and 2 (13.2%; 95% CI: 8.7%, 19.5%) discontinued their medications during pregnancy. Medication adherence during pregnancy differed significantly by drug class. A greater proportion of women on biologics (41.5%; 95% CI 32.9%, 50.7%) were adherent during pregnancy than women on thiopurines (22.9%; 95% CI 16.1%, 31.5%; P = 0.006); adherence was not significantly different for 5-aminosalicylates (35.6%; 95% CI 27.4%, 44.8%; P = 0.204).

This is a rare entity, requiring nuanced decision-making regarding surgery as well as adjuvant therapies given the unique hormonal environment seen in individuals taking exogenous androgen as part of their gender identity. Contemporary case report derived from our clinical experience. Discussion focuses on a brief summation of all known cases of female-to-male breast cancer in FtM individuals described in the literature. A 48-year-old FtM transgender individual on exogenous testosterone for 19 years with stage IIA (pT1cN1M0), ER+(8/8), PR+(8/8), Androgen Receptor(AR)+(5%-8%), Her-2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Due to AR positivity in tumor, cessation of testosterone was chosen after careful consideration of potential ramifications from both a cancer treatment as well as gender identity standpoint. Endocrinology consultation reassured the patient that identity affirming changes of facial hair growth and voice depth would persist after cessation of testosterone. Patient did not wish to undergo chemotherapy and as such was treated with combination of radiation to the axilla, adjuvant Anastrozole and testosterone cessation. Although breast cancer is rare in FtM transgender individuals, it can occur. Many FtM individuals take exogenous testosterone. It is important to test the tumor for the androgen receptor as this may have important implications for both gender identity and treatment. Additionally, the mastectomy commonly performed for top surgery in this population is not adequate for oncologic control by itself and at present there is no guidance regarding postsurgical screening in this population, especially in those individuals with a strong family history of breast cancer.",2020-05-01,Breast Journal,https://openalex.org/V169520197,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.13655,,,,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990811094,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.13655,journal-article,2990811094

We argue that these trends signify a shift from the entrepreneurial city to new strategies that shape cities for entrepreneurs. Underpinning this development is a broad normalization and valorization of entrepreneurship as the dominant pathway for urban economic growth. Additionally, we show how sustainability and greening are enrolled in these economic development strategies, promising to bolster the environmental image of the city. We highlight these two changes by focusing on the intellectual foundations of the technopolis concept in Austin, Texas, and the development of a cleantech entrepreneurial ecosystem that has increasingly been leveraged in Austin’s entrepreneurial growth efforts.

No effective treatment is available for prion diseases. Metformin is a first-line medication for treatment of type 2 diabetes which is known to activate AMPK and induce autophagy through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR1) signaling. Metformin was reported to be beneficial in various protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. In this study we investigated the anti-prion effect of metformin in persistently prion-infected neuronal cells. Our data showed that metformin significantly decreased the PrPSc load in the treated cells, as shown by less PK resistant PrP in Western blots and reduced prion conversion activity in Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay in both 22L-ScN2a and RML-ScCAD5 cells. Additionally, metformin induced autophagy as shown by higher levels of LC3-II in treated cells compared with control cells. On the other hand, our mouse bioassay showed that oral metformin at a dose of 2 mg/ml in drinking water had no effect on the survival of prion-infected mice. In conclusion, our findings describe the anti-prion effect of metformin in two persistently prion-infected neuronal cell lines. This effect can be explained at least partially by the autophagy inducing activity of metformin.

The stratigraphic record of submarine slope channels includes heterogeneous, composite deposits that provide evidence for erosion, sediment bypass, and deposition. However, the timing and duration of these processes is poorly constrained over geologic time scales. We integrate geochronology with detailed stratigraphic characterization to temporally constrain the stratigraphic evolution recorded by horizontally to vertically aligned channel-fill stacking patterns in a Nanaimo Group channel system exposed on Hornby and Denman Islands, British Columbia, Canada. Twelve detrital zircon samples (n = 300/sample) were used to calculate maximum depositional ages, which identified a new age range for the succession from ca. 7 to 6 Ma. We document five phases of submarine-channel evolution over 16.0 ± 1.7 m.y. including: an initial phase dominated by incision, sediment bypass, and limited deposition (phase 1); followed by increasingly shorter and more rapid phases of deposition on the slope by laterally migrating (phase 2) and aggrading channels (phase 3); a long period of deep incision (phase 4); and a final rapid phase of vertical channel aggradation (phase 5). Our results suggest that ∼60% of the evolutionary history of the submarine channel system is captured in an incomplete, poorly preserved record of incision and sediment bypass, which makes up &amp;lt;20% of outcropping stratigraphy.

To recycle ammonia nitrogen resources, a system that combined adsorption and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A/AAO) process for treating low strength wastewater was established. Experimental results showed that by the addition of carbon substrate from a mixture of anaerobically fermented adsorption sludge, the average removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, TN, and TP were 88%, 96.9%, 93.9%, and 92.1%, respectively, and the ratio of nitrogen assimilation to nitrogen dissimilation significantly increased by a factor of 2.5. Through energy analysis (based on adenosine triphosphate, ATP), sludge flocculation capacity and settling property, it was found that the AAO process sludge presented the logarithmic growth characteristics. The respective sludge protein and amino acids contents increased by over 11.4% and 40.3%, and the synthetic products of glutamic acid, alanine and aspartate increased through the assimilation of ammonia nitrogen, thereby indicating that replenishing the carbon substrate could markedly enhance protein and amino acids contents in AAO process sludge. Moreover, the diversity of the microbial community in adsorption process was relatively rich, the diversity in the adsorption process sludge was the highest, while the diversity of the AAO process sludge evidently decreased. The microbial community in each process was similarly based on 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, microflora was prominent in the AAO process, with Dechloromonas, Flavobacterium, Zoogloea, Unclassified_Rhodocyclaceae and Thauera as the dominant species.

We investigated the impact of low cardiorespiratory fitness during young and middle adulthood on premature death in healthy adults from recent generations.A prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of US Baby Boomers and Generation Xers (born 1945-1980).

NAFLD research has typically focused on the pathophysiology associated with lipid metabolism, using traditional measures such as histology and serum transaminase assessment; these methods have provided key information regarding NAFLD progression. Although valuable, these techniques are limited in providing further insight into the mechanistic details of inflammation associated with NAFLD. Intravital microscopy (IVM) is an advanced tool that allows for real-time visualization of cellular behavior and interaction in a living animal. Extensive IVM imaging has been conducted in liver, but, in the context of NAFLD, this technique has been regularly avoided due to significant tissue autofluorescence, a phenomenon that is exacerbated with steatosis. Here, we demonstrate that, using multiple imaging platforms and optimization techniques to minimize autofluorescence, IVM in fatty liver is possible. Successful fatty liver intravital imaging provides details on cell trafficking, recruitment, function, and behavior in addition to information about blood flow and vessel dynamics, information which was previously difficult to obtain. As more than 30% of the global population is overweight/obese, there is a significant proportion of the population at risk for NAFLD and complications due to NAFLD (liver decompensation, cirrhosis, HCC).

Research has retrospectively identified biomechanical variables associated with a history of tibial stress fracture in runners, however, the effect that load carriage has on these variables remains unknown.What are the effects of load carriage on running biomechanical variables associated with a history of tibial stress fracture?Twenty-one women ran at 3.0 m/s on an instrumented treadmill in four load carriage conditions: 0, 4.5, 11.3, and 22.7 kg. Motion capture and ground reaction force data were collected. Dependent variables included average loading rate, peak absolute free moment, peak hip adduction, peak rearfoot eversion, and stride frequency. Linear mixed models were used to asses the effect of load carriage and body mass on dependent variables.A load x body mass interaction was observed for stride frequency only (p = 0.017). Stride frequency increased with load carriage of 22.7-kg, but lighter participants illustrated a greater change than heavier participants. Average loading rate (p < 0.001) and peak free moment (p = 0.015) were greater in the 22.7-kg condition, while peak rearfoot eversion (p ≤ 0.023) was greater in the 11.3- and 22.7-kg conditions, compared to the unloaded condition. Load carriage did not affect peak hip adduction (p = 0.67).Participants adapted to heavy load carriage by increasing stride frequency. This was especially evident in lighter participants who increased stride frequency to a greater extent than heavier participants.

Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory iron-carrying, bifidogenic glycoprotein found in all vertebrates and in mammalian milk, leukocytes and exocrine secretions. Lactoferrin aids in creating an environment for growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, thus reducing colonization with pathogenic bacteria. It is hypothesized that oral bovine lactoferrin (bLF), through its antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, will reduce the rate of mortality or major morbidity in very low birth weight preterm infants. Method Lactoferrin Infant Feeding Trial_Canada (LIFT_Canada) is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized controlled trial with the aim to enroll 50 infants whose data will be combined with the data of the 154 infants enrolled from Lactoferrin Infant Feeding Trial_Australia/New Zealand (LIFT_ANZ) in a pooled intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible infants will be randomized and allocated to one of two treatment groups: 1) a daily dose of 20 mg/kg bLF in breast/donor human milk or formula milk until 3 weeks corrected gestation or for a minimum of  weeks, whichever is longer, or until discharge home or transfer, if earlier; 2) no bLF with daily feeds. The primary outcome will be determined at 36 weeks corrected gestation for the presence of neonatal morbidity and at discharge for survival and treated retinopathy of prematurity. The duration of the trial is expected to be 36 months. Discussion Currently, there continues to be no clear answer related to the benefit of bLF in reducing mortality or any or all of the significant neonatal morbidities in very low birth weight infants. LIFT_Canada is designed with the hope that the pooled results from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada may help to clarify the situation.

Microbial methane oxidation can be a significant methane sink. Here, we inoculated replicated, sand-packed, continuous mesocosms with groundwater from a field methane release experiment. The mesocosms experienced thirty-five weeks of dynamic methane, oxygen and nitrate concentrations. We determined concentrations and stable isotope signatures of methane, carbon dioxide and nitrate and monitored microbial community composition of suspended and attached biomass. Methane oxidation was strictly dependent on oxygen availability and led to enrichment of 13 C in residual methane. Nitrate did not enhance methane oxidation under oxygen limitation. Methylotrophs persisted for weeks in the absence of methane, making them a powerful marker for active as well as past methane leaks. Thirty-nine distinct populations of methylotrophic bacteria were observed. Methylotrophs mainly occurred attached to sediment particles. Abundances of methanotrophs and other methylotrophs were roughly similar across all samples, pointing at transfer of metabolites from the former to the latter. Two populations of Gracilibacteria (Candidate Phyla Radiation) displayed successive blooms, potentially triggered by a period of methane famine.

However, a small sulfur loading and limited utilization of active material hamper its practical application. Besides, an elevated temperature is usually required for the operation of SSLSBs. In the present work, a homogeneous nanostructured sulfur-Ketjen black (S@KB) composite cathode was synthesized through an energy-efficient deposition method. A stable and highly ionic conductive composite polymer-ceramic electrolyte (CPE) was employed as the solid-state electrolyte. The SSLSB delivered a pronounced specific capacity of 110 mA h g−1 and areal capacity of 1.77 mA h cm−2, and demonstrated stable cycling for 5 cycles. Also, benefiting from fast reaction kinetics, the SSLSB was able to operate at 2 °C and established an excellent rate capability.

Also, it is shown that the Bayesian SUR models can provide more flexible and accurate modeling than the standard multivariate regression (SMR) models with the same covariate structure across different responses. Besides, the proposed approach also takes into account the correlation structure of the response data, the variability of the process distribution, and the uncertainty of model parameters as well as the prediction performance of the response model.

TRPM8 is a cold and menthol-sensitive channel found in a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Deletion or inhibition of the TRPM8 channel was found to prevent the cold hyperalgesia induced by chronic administration of morphine. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which morphine was able to promote cold hypersensitivity in DRG neurons and transfected HEK cells. Mice daily injected with morphine for 5 days developed cold hyperalgesia. Treatment with morphine did not alter the expressions of cold sensitive TREK-1, TRAAK and TRPM8 in DRGs. However, TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons isolated from morphine-treated mice exhibited hyperexcitability. Sustained morphine treatment in vitro sensitized TRPM8 responsiveness to cold or menthol and reduced activation-evoked desensitization of the channel. Blocking phospholipase C (PLC) as well as protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), but not protein kinase A (PKA) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), restored channel desensitization. Identification of two PKC phosphorylation consensus sites, S1040 and S1041, in the TRPM8 and their site-directed mutation were able to prevent the MOR-induced reduction in TRPM8 desensitization. Our results show that activation of MOR by morphine 1) promotes hyperexcitability of TRPM8-expressing neurons and 2) induces a PKCβ-mediated reduction of TRPM8 desensitization. This MOR-PKCβ dependent modulation of TRPM8 may underlie the onset of cold hyperalgesia caused by repeated administration of morphine. Our findings point to TRPM8 channel and PKCβ as important targets for opioid-induced cold hypersensitivity.",2020-04-14,Molecular Brain,https://openalex.org/V182046277,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00599-0,,,13,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016104954,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00599-0,journal-article,3016104954

The role of primary health care (PHC) providers for this population is poorly understood. Perspectives from these providers, such as family physicians and other members of the primary care team, have not been explored in depth. Methods A total of 18 participants (e.g., family physicians, social workers, nurses) were recruited from  Primary Care Networks in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted, and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative description approach was used to analyze the data, and included thematic analysis. Results Five distinct, yet overlapping, roles of primary health care providers for adolescents and young adults transitioning to adult care resulted from our analysis: (1) being the “ common thread ” (continuous accessible care); (2) caring for the “ whole patient ” (comprehensive care); (3) “ knowing families ” (family-partnered care); (4) “ empowering ” adolescents and young adults to develop “personal responsibility” (developmentally-appropriate care); and (5) “ quarterbacking ” care (coordination of specialist and/or community-based care). Participants identified potential benefits of these roles for adolescents and young adults transitioning to adult care, and barriers in practice (e.g., lack of time, having minimal involvement in pediatric care). Conclusions Input from family physicians, who follow their patients across the lifespan and provide the majority of primary care in Canada, are critical for informing and refining recommended transition practices. Our findings provide insights, from PHC providers themselves, to bolster the rationale for primary care involvement during transitions from pediatric specialty and community-based care for AYAs.

In recent years, a series of animal models have demonstrated that obesity-inducing diets can result in synovial joint damage (both with and without the superimposition of trauma), which may be related to changes in percentage of body fat and a series of low-level systemic inflammatory mediators. Of note, there is a disparity between whether the dietary challenges commence at weaning, representing a weanling onset, or at skeletal maturity, representing an adult onset of obesity. We wished to evaluate the effect of the dietary exposure time and the age at which animals are exposed to a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet to determine whether these factors may result in disparate outcomes, as there is evidence suggesting that these factors result in differential metabolic disturbances. Based on dietary exposure time, we hypothesized that rats fed an HFS diet for 14 weeks from weaning (HFS Weanling) would demonstrate an increase in knee joint damage scores, whereas rats exposed to the HFS diet for 4 weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age (HFS Adult) and rats exposed to a standard chow diet (Chow) would not display an increase in knee joint damage scores. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either an HFS diet for 14 weeks from weaning (HFS Weanling) or an HFS diet for 4 weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age (HFS Adult). At sacrifice, joints were scored using the modified Mankin Criteria, and serum was analyzed for a defined subset of inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor α). Results When the HFS Weanling and HFS Adult groups were compared, both groups had a similar percent of body fat, although the HFS Weanling group had a significantly greater body mass than the HFS Adult group. The HFS Weanling and HFS Adult animals had a significant increase in body mass and percentage of body fat when compared to the Chow group. Although knee joint damage scores were low in all  groups, we found, contrary to our hypothesis, that the HFS Adult group had statistically significant greater knee joint damage scores than the Chow and HFS Weanling groups. Furthermore, we observed that the HFS Weanling group did not have significant differences in knee joint damage scores relative to the Chow group. Conclusion These findings indicate that the HFS Weanling animals were better able to cope with the dietary challenge of an HFS diet than the HFS Adult group. Interestingly, when assessing various serum proinflammatory markers, no significant differences were detected between the HFS Adult and HFS Weanling groups. Although details regarding the mechanisms underlying an increase in knee joint damage scores in the HFS Adult group remain to be elucidated, these findings indicate that dietary exposure time maybe less important than the age at which an HFS diet is introduced. Moreover, increases in serum proinflammatory mediators do not appear to be directly linked to knee joint damage scores in the HFS Weanling group animals but may be partially responsible for the observed knee joint damage in the adults over the very short time of exposure to the HFS diet.",2020-03-01,Journal of Sport and Health Science,https://openalex.org/V2485047394,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.06.004,132,139,9,2,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2953113563,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2019.06.004,journal-article,2953113563

A pedestrian (walking) mode of evacuation is an efficient mode of transportation that is often overlooked in the literature. Fairness in the evacuation process is another aspect that is rarely studied. In this paper, we study efficiency and fairness of pedestrian mode of emergency evacuation. We model the evacuation problem as a dynamic network flow problem, which captures the time-dependency of the network attributes such as edge and vertex capacities and edge travel times. To evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms, we consider the clearance time of the network. To investigate fairness, we consider the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve that are popular indexes in economy to measure wealth distribution in a society. We compute the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve to measure the fairness in travel time distribution of the evacuees in the emergency evacuation process. We develop a new algorithm called PEPA (Pedestrian Evacuation Planning Algorithm) to find the minimum clearance time of the network. PEPA is compared to two commonly studied graph algorithms in the literature, shortest path and maximum flow algorithms. We compared the algorithms in terms of computation time of the algorithm, clearance time of the network and Gini coefficient. Our results show that PEPA beats both shortest path and maximum flow in terms of efficiency and fairness, although it is slightly slower in terms of computation time. To implement PEPA, shortest path and maximum flow algorithms, we develop a new software named PEMSS (Pedestrian Evacuation Modeler, Solver, and Simulator). PEMSS is written in the Java programming language and is capable of reading and showing maps in open street map XML format.",2020-01-01,Safety Science,https://openalex.org/V123149298,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2019.08.020,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975224534,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2019.08.020,journal-article,2975224534

Previously, cellulose ether compounds (CEs) have been shown to significantly extend the survival of mice inoculated with mouse-adapted prion strains. In this study, we used CEs, TC-5RW, and 60SH-50, in vitro and in vivo to assess their efficacy to interfere with CWD prion propagation. In vitro, CEs inhibited CWD prion amplification in a dose-dependent manner. Transgenic mice over-expressing elk PrPC (tgElk) were injected subcutaneously with a single dose of either of the CEs, followed by intracerebral inoculation with different CWD isolates from white tailed deer, mule deer, or elk. All treated groups showed a prolonged survival of up to more than 30 % when compared to the control group regardless of the CWD isolate used for infection. The extended survival in the treated groups correlated with reduced proteinase K resistance of prions. Remarkably, passage of brain homogenates from treated or untreated animals in tgElk mice resulted in a prolonged life span of mice inoculated with homogenates from CE-treated mice (of + 17%) even in the absence of further treatment. Besides the delayed disease onset upon passage in TgElk mice, the reduced proteinase K resistance was maintained but less pronounced. Therefore, these compounds can be very useful in limiting the spread of CWD in captive and wild-ranging cervids.",2020-03-01,Journal of Neurochemistry,https://openalex.org/V135837084,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.14877,727,740,152,6,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975494298,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.14877,journal-article,2975494298

We sought to determine if simple cardiac risk scores are associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease including carotid wall volume (CWV), carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), and silent brain infarction (SBI). Methods and results A total of 759 adults with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) underwent risk factor assessment and a non-contrast enhanced MRI of the carotid arteries and brain using a standardized protocol in a population-based cohort recruited between 201 and 2018. The non-lab-based INTERHEART risk score (IHRS) was calculated in all participants; the Framingham Risk Score was calculated in a subset who provided blood samples (n = 3889). The association between these risk scores and MRI measures of CWV, carotid IPH, and SBI was determined. The mean age of the cohort was 5 (8.9) years, 55% were women. Each 5-point increase (∼1 SD) in the IHRS was associated with a  mm3 increase in CWV, adjusted for sex (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), a 23% increase in IPH [95% confidence interval (CI) 9–38%], and a 32% (95% CI 20–45%) increase in SBI. These associations were consistent for lacunar and non-lacunar brain infarction. The Framingham Risk Score was also significantly associated with CWV, IPH, and SBI. CWV was additive and independent to the risk scores in its association with IPH and SBI. Conclusion Simple cardiovascular risk scores are significantly associated with the presence of MRI-detected subclinical cerebrovascular disease, including CWV, IPH, and SBI in an adult population without known clinical CVD.",2020-06-01,European Journal of Echocardiography,https://openalex.org/V64942916,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez226,692,700,21,6,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977423392,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jez226,journal-article,2977423392

We examined the joint factor structure of the 3 facets of the NEO Personality Inventory – Revised (NEO-PI-R; or the NEO-PI-3) with either (a) the 2 facets of the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) or (b) the 1 facets of the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) plus several dissociation scales, using self-reports from participant samples of previous research. The NEO-PI-R[3]/PID-5 variable set produced seven factors that represented the HEXACO factor space plus a “psychoticism” dimension. The NEO-PI-R/SNAP/dissociation variable set produced a similar set of seven factors. The results indicate that even some questionnaire variable sets not constructed to measure the HEXACO factors can recover those personality dimensions.

This motivates us to develop a texture feature extraction method to discriminate Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients from controls. But, the lack of data in ALS research is a major constraint and can be mitigated by using data from multiple centers. However, multi-center data gives some other challenges such as differing scanner parameters and variation in intensity of the medical images, which motivate the development of the proposed method. To investigate these challenges, we propose a gradient-based texture feature extraction method called Modified Co-occurrence Histograms of Oriented Gradients (M-CoHOG) to extract texture features from 2D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). We also propose a new feature-normalization technique before feeding the normalized M-CoHOG features into an ensemble of classifiers, which can accommodate for variation of data from different centers. ALS datasets from four different centers are used in the experiments. We analyze the classification accuracy of single center data as well as that arising from multiple centers. It is observed that the extracted texture features from downsampled images are more significant in distinguishing between patients and controls. Moreover, using an ensemble of classifiers shows improvement in classification accuracy over a single classifier in multi-center data.

It is unclear whether adding vasopressin or vasopressin analogues to catecholamine therapy is beneficial in the management of patients with distributive shock. The purpose of this guideline was to develop an evidence-based recommendation regarding the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors in the management of adults with distributive shock. We summarized the evidence informing this recommendation by updating a recently published meta-analysis. Then, a multidisciplinary panel from the Canadian Critical Care Society developed the recommendation using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The updated systematic review identified 25 randomized controlled trials including a total of 3,737 patients with distributive shock. Compared with catecholamine therapy alone, the addition of vasopressin or its analogues was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 0.99; low certainty), reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.88; high certainty), and increased risk of digital ischemia (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.25; moderate certainty). After considering certainty in the evidence, values and preferences, cost, and other factors, the expert guideline panel suggests using vasopressin or vasopressin analogues in addition to catecholamines over catecholamine vasopressors alone for the management of distributive shock (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).",2020-03-01,Canadian Journal Of Anesthesia/journal Canadien D'anesthésie,https://openalex.org/V4210186964,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-019-01546-x,,,,,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994116020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-019-01546-x,journal-article,2994116020

The first years of life are a critical period in its development. While delivery mode and diet contribute to observed variation, the additional contribution of specific environmental factors remains poorly understood. One factor is waterborne enteric pathogen exposure. In this pilot study, we explore the relationship between household water security and the gut microbiota of children.From Nicaraguan households (n = 39), we collected drinking water samples, as well as fecal samples from children aged one month to 5.99 years (n = 53). We tested water samples for total coliforms (CFU/mL) and the presence of common enteric pathogens. Composition and diversity of the gut microbiota were characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing. Households were classified as having drinking water that was ""low"" (<29 CFU/mL) or ""high"" (≥29 CFU/mL) in coliforms. We used permutational analyses of variance and Mann-Whitney U-tests to identify differences in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota of children living in these two home types.Insecure access led households to store drinking water and 85% tested positive for coliforms. High concentrations of Salmonella and Campylobacter were found in water and fecal samples. Controlling for age, the gut microbiota of children from high coliform homes were compositionally different and less diverse than those from low coliform homes.Results indicate that research exploring the ways water insecurity affects human biology should consider the gut microbiome and that investigations of inter-population variation in the gut microbial community of children should consider pathogen exposure and infection.",2020-01-01,American Journal of Human Biology,https://openalex.org/V179381287,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23371,,,32,1,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994746054,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23371,journal-article,2994746054

During these episodes, populations are exposed to adverse short-term health effects due to elevated levels of fine particulate matter, which is the primary pollutant associated with smoke. The spatial resolution of ground-based monitoring records generally is not sufficient for emergency preparedness and epidemiological studies of such events. Accurate spatial and temporal models of smoke pollution for the study of smoke exposure effects require reliable, fine-scale input data. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) measures can provide a valuable alternative to the coarse spatial resolution of ground PM2.5 monitoring network measurements. Numerous statistical approaches have been used to estimate the link between AOD and PM2.5, most of which consider the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 as being fixed over space and for an entire day; however, due to time-varying meteorological variables, that relationship changes over time and space. Hence, to capture the effects of temporal and spatial variations on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, two nested linear mixed effect (LME) models are developed herein. Daily estimation of PM2.5 concentration is derived by incorporating nested period-zone-specific random effects of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship over the province of Alberta, Canada. Model validation shows that LME improves the estimation performance of the model compared with ordinary multivariate linear regression by more than 115%. Our findings indicate that the potential of the LME model increases when additional variables are integrated with AOD measures in a multivariate framework. This single model yields an array of reliable spatial-temporal estimates of daily PM2.5 concentrations from wildfire at fine spatial resolution.",2020-02-01,"Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health",https://openalex.org/V207573527,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-019-00780-y,173,185,13,2,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998573632,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-019-00780-y,journal-article,2998573632

Further, we perform a comprehensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the VIC model using a robust and state‐of‐the‐art approach. The VIC model simulations utilize the recently developed variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) technique that requires in this application more than 6,000 model simulations for a 30‐year (1981–2010) study period. The method seeks parameter sensitivity, identifies influential parameters, and showcases streamflow sensitivity to parameter uncertainty at seasonal and annual timescales. Results suggest that the Ensemble VIC simulations match observed streamflow closest, whereas global reanalysis products yield high flows (0.5–3.0 mm day⁻¹) against observations and an overestimation (10–60%) in seasonal and annual water balance terms. VIC parameters exhibit seasonal importance in VARS, and the choice of input data and performance metrics substantially affect sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty propagation due to input forcing selection in each water balance term (i.e., total runoff, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration) is examined separately to show both time and space dimensionality in available forcing data at seasonal and annual timescales. Reliable input forcing, the most influential model parameters, and the uncertainty envelope in streamflow prediction are presented for the VIC model. These results, along with some specific recommendations, are expected to assist the broader VIC modelling community and other users of VARS and land surface schemes, to enhance their modelling applications.",2020-04-30,Hydrological Processes,https://openalex.org/V75830442,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13711,2057,2075,34,9,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003820917,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13711,journal-article,3003820917

Each person's level of PL partly depends on their physical and cognitive skills, confidence level, and degree of motivation to practice PA daily. New technologies, such as exergames and wearable fitness trackers, may enable older adults to increase their PL, stimulating uptake and ongoing PA participation. Objective: This focus group study aims to describe older adults' perceptions of the use of technologies to engage in physical exercise programs. Methods: Fifteen participants were randomly selected from a sample of 40 older adults who completed a randomized controlled trial that investigated the benefits of using technology in the context of group-based exercise programs. Separate post-intervention focus groups were performed with an exergaming group, a conventional physical training group, and a no training group (control). Data were mapped onto constructs from the four domains of PL: affective, physical, cognitive, and behavioral. Results: Generally, participants expressed positive perceptions about the benefits of using technology to engage in PA. These positive feelings outweighed the costs and the lack of familiarization with technology. Common themes for the three groups emerged from the discussions and included familiarization with technology, using fitness tracker to monitor PA, previous exposure to technology, and interaction with peers, staff members, and relatives. In particular, participants from the exergaming group explored the ideas of training their cognitive skills while using the exergame accessories, exercising in an alternative way, competitive versus cooperative play, changes in sense of humor, skill transferability from game to real environment, progressions of the exercise intensities, and the potential use of exergames for rehabilitation. Conclusions: Participants in this study reported positive perceptions about implementing technology into exercise. Emphasizing the benefits of using technology in group-based exercise programs may increase older adults' PL levels and their future technology adoption. The potential implementation of technology into conventional exercise programs should focus on older adults' lifelong values, biopsychosocial conditions, and the possibility of reducing age-related risk of injuries and chronic diseases.",2020-02-11,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,https://openalex.org/V15239247,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041144,1144,1144,17,4,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005715577,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041144,journal-article,3005715577

However, this information is not available in administrative healthcare data. We aimed to derive an indicator of baseline stroke severity using these data. Methods and Results: We identified patients with stroke enrolled in a population-based registry in Ontario, Canada, and used the Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS), documented in the registry, as a measure of stroke severity. We derived an estimated CNS from a linear regression model in which we regressed the observed CNS on predictor variables: age, sex, arrival by ambulance, interhospital transfer, mechanical ventilation, and an emergency department triage score. The effect of stroke severity on the estimated hazard ratios for 30-day mortality was determined in  Cox-proportional hazards models with (1) no CNS, (2) observed CNS, and (3) estimated CNS, all adjusted for age, sex, Charlson index, and stroke type. We assessed model discrimination using C statistics. To assess for construct validity, we repeated these analyses in a subset of patients with documented National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and in a cohort of patients with stroke external to the registry. We derived the estimated stroke severity in 4 48 patients (48.7% female, median age of 7 years [interquartile range, 64– 83]). The magnitude of the association between stroke severity and mortality was similar for the observed and estimated CNS. The discriminative ability of the Cox-proportional hazards models to predict mortality was highest when the observed CNS was included (C statistic, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.81–0.82]), moderate with estimated CNS (0.7 [0.75–0.76]), and lowest without CNS (0.6 [0.69–0.70]. Our findings were replicated with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and in the external cohort. Conclusions: We derived an estimated measure of stroke severity using administrative data.

High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a sensitive tool capable of evaluating bone microarchitecture and erosions, and 3D rigid image registration can be used to visualize and quantify bone remodeling over time. However, patient motion during image acquisition can cause a “stack shift” artifact resulting in loss of information and reducing the number of erosions that can be analyzed using HR-pQCT. The purpose of this study was to use image registration to improve the number of useable HR-pQCT scans and to apply image-based bone remodeling assessment to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of RA patients. Methods Ten participants with RA completed HR-pQCT scans of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints at enrolment to the study and at a 6-month follow-up interval. At 6-months, an additional repeat scan was acquired to evaluate reliability. HR-pQCT images were acquired in three individual  cm acquisitions (stacks) with a 25% overlap. We completed analysis first using standard evaluation methods, and second with multi-stack registration. We assessed whether additional erosions could be evaluated after multi-stack registration. Bone remodeling analysis was completed using registration and transformation of baseline and follow-up images. We calculated the bone formation and resorption volume fractions with 6-month follow-up, and same-day repositioning as a negative control. Results 13/57 (23%) of erosions could not be analyzed from raw images due to a stack shift artifact. All erosions could be volumetrically assessed after multi-stack registration. We observed that there was a median bone formation fraction of 2.1% and resorption fraction of 3.8% in RA patients over the course of  months. In contrast to the same-day rescan negative control, we observed median bone formation and resorption fractions of 0%. Conclusions Multi-stack image registration is a useful tool to improve the number of useable scans when analyzing erosions using HR-pQCT. Further, image registration can be used to longitudinally assess bone remodeling. These methods could be implemented in future studies to provide important pathophysiological information on the progression of bone damage.",2020-04-07,BMC Medical Imaging,https://openalex.org/V6505649,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-020-00437-8,,,20,1,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014710192,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-020-00437-8,journal-article,3014710192

This study aimed to investigate the impact of treatment (radiation therapy ± concurrent chemotherapy) on (i) muscle strength, muscle cross-sectional area and patient-reported outcomes, and (ii) central and peripheral alterations during a whole-body exercise task. Ten people with head and neck cancer (4 female; 50 ± 9 years) completed a lab visit before and after (56 ± 30 days) completion of treatment. Participants performed a neuromuscular assessment (involving maximal isometric voluntary contractions in the knee extensors and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve) before and during intermittent cycling to volitional exhaustion. Anthropometrics and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed. From before to after treatment, maximal isometric muscle strength was reduced (P = 0.002, d = 0.73), as was potentiated twitch force (P < 0.001, d = 0.62), and muscle cross-sectional area (e.g., vastus lateralis: P = 0.010, d = 0.64). Exercise time was reduced (P = 0.008, d = 0.62) and peripheral processes contributed to a reduction in maximal force due to cycling. After treatment, the severity of self-reported fatigue increased (P = 0.041, r = − 0.65) and health-related quality of life decreased (P = 0.012, r = − 0.79). Neuromuscular function was impaired in patients with head and neck cancer after treatment. Whole-body exercise tolerance was reduced and resulted in predominantly peripheral, rather than central, disturbances to the neuromuscular system.

Among the various complications associated with ANP, acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major contributor leading to high mortality rates associated with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) in human patients. The incidence of ALI/ARDS in ANP dogs is not well-characterized in spontaneous AP and there are no models to study it in rodent models. Most of the data related to AP comes from rodent models of AP, which may not always represent the true mechanisms occurring in the lungs of dogs or humans with ANP. Therefore, this manuscript provides a review of current and potential models to study the role of pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) in acute pancreatitis. Recently, we characterized lung inflammation in clinical cases of AP in dogs and found significant recruitment of PIMs which have been credited as pro-inflammatory cells in species such as cattle, horse, pigs, and sheep that normally have them. Considering the pro-inflammatory roles of constitutive or induced PIMs, we investigated whether a well-established mouse model of ANP has induced PIMs. We found induced PIMs in L-arginine-induced ANP in mouse and that MCP-1 is important in PIM induction in this model. Taken together, now we summarize information on spontaneous ANP in dog and a mouse model of induced ANP to study mechanisms of lung dysfunction and the role of PIMs during ANP.",2020-04-22,Cell and Tissue Research,https://openalex.org/V139399906,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03211-y,207,222,380,2,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016750809,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03211-y,journal-article,3016750809

The objective of this study was to develop a population-based case-finding strategy to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed airflow obstruction (asthma or COPD) amongst adults with respiratory symptoms in Canada. Methods Adults without a previous history of asthma, COPD or lung disease were recruited using random digit-dialling and asked if they had symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum or wheeze within the past  months. Those who answered affirmatively completed the Asthma Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), COPD-Diagnostic Questionnaire (COPD-DQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Those with an ASQ score of ≥ or a COPD-DQ score of ≥2 underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry to diagnose asthma or COPD. Results 1 11 individuals were contacted at home and assessed for study eligibility. Of the 126 eligible individuals, 91 (72%) enrolled and underwent spirometry. Ultimately, 18 subjects (20% of those enrolled) had obstructive lung disease (73 asthma and 11 COPD). Individuals found to have undiagnosed asthma or COPD had more severe respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life compared with those without airflow obstruction. The ASQ, COPD-DQ, and CAT had ROC areas for predicting undiagnosed asthma or COPD of 0.49, 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. Four descriptive variables (age, BMI, sex and pack-years smoked) produced better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values than the questionnaires (ROC area=0.68).

It is a safe and highly effective treatment, and its number needed to treat of 2.6 is one of the highest throughout medicine. The ultimate goal when performing EVT is to maximize chances of good outcome through achievement of fast first-pass complete reperfusion, as incomplete and delayed reperfusion increases complication rates and negatively affects outcome. Since EVT has been established as standard of care, new devices have been developed and treatment techniques have been refined. This review provides a brief overview about the rationale for and history of EVT, followed by a detailed step-by-step description of how to perform EVT using the BADDASS (BAlloon guide with large bore Distal access catheter with Dual Aspiration with Stent-retriever as Standard approach), a combined technique, which is in our opinion the safest and most effective way to achieve fast first-pass complete reperfusion.

Heating the formation to a high temperature greatly reduces the oil viscosity, which increases the oil mobility in the reservoir. In the SAGD process, the steam injected through a long horizontal well creates a steam saturated zone, called steam chamber, around the well that gradually expands laterally and vertically within the reservoir. The edge of the growing steam chamber is where the oil is displaced by the steam. There is a large temperature gradient in the oil drainage zone with steam temperature at the edge of the steam chamber and close to the original reservoir temperature on the other side of the drainage zone. The fluid flow behavior, which is controlled by relative permeability, can be sensitive to the temperature in this transition zone. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of temperature on two-phase bitumen/water relative permeability of sand over a wide range of temperature from 7 to 220 °C. In the present study, isothermal displacement experiments were conducted with an advanced experimental rig under the confining pressure of 140 psi using Athabasca bitumen, deionized water, and clean silica sand at six different temperatures. All experiments were repeated to ensure that the results are repeatable and reliable. The JBN (Johnson, Bossler and Neumann) method was used to obtain the two-phase relative permeability. The effect of temperature on relative permeability for the bitumen system was found to be substantial and should be accounted for in simulation of SAGD processes. The endpoint water relative permeability can increase by two orders of magnitude in going from the reservoir temperature to the steam temperature. The endpoint oil relative permeability also increases, albeit more modestly and the residual oil saturation decreases. Besides the relative permeability tests, contact angle and IFT measurements at high-temperature, high-pressure conditions were conducted to evaluate the fluid-fluid and rock-fluid interactions and examine any changes in wettability. According to the contact angle results, the wettability of system was water-wet and shifted toward strongly water-wet at higher temperatures. In addition, the IFT displayed a decreasing trend with temperature and reached the minimum value of 18 mN/m in the temperature range of 125–155 °C.",2020-09-15,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.118014,118014,118014,276,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3025179720,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.118014,journal-article,3025179720

Parents reported on their children's HRQOL at diagnosis, and at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 8-, and 10-year follow-ups using the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire-55. Trajectories of HRQOL were identified using latent class growth models. Characteristics of children, parents, and families at the time of diagnosis that were associated with each trajectory were identified using multinomial logistic regression.A total of 36 children were included. Four unique HRQOL trajectories were identified; 11% of the cohort was characterized by low and stable scores, 18% by intermediate and stable scores, 35% by intermediate scores that increased then plateaued, and 43% by high scores that increased then plateaued. Absence of comorbidities, less severe epilepsy, and better family environment (greater satisfaction with family relationships and fewer family demands) at the time of diagnosis were associated with better long-term HRQOL trajectories. Although the analyses used estimates for missing values and accounted for any nonrandom attrition, the proportion of children with poorer HRQOL trajectories may be underestimated.Children with new onset epilepsy are heterogenous and follow unique HRQOL trajectories over the long term. Overall, HRQOL improves for the majority in the first  years after diagnosis, with these improvements sustained over the long term.",2020-07-01,Epilepsia,https://openalex.org/V203153751,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16579,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034861687,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16579,journal-article,3034861687

This perspective reveals significant epistemological blind spots in the localist and non-relational ontologies that undergird much of the urban sustainability discourse. While the city of Freiburg has garnered world-wide attention for its multi-faceted initiatives and achievements in sustainable urban development, these initiatives have yet to be coherently addressed in the wider Freiburg metropolitan region, leading to a variety of policies and practices in the hinterland that run counter to Freiburg’s ‘green city’ objectives. In a parallel fashion, the city of Calgary incorporated significant sustainability principles in its 2009 Master Development Plan and Transportation Plan –‘Plan-It’– yet such principles have not been taken up on a regional scale. Despite substantial differences in size and developmental history, both cities exhibit a profound disconnection from their regional contexts with regard to sustainable development policies and politics. In both metropolitan regions, conventional growth politics are still paramount. A significant conflict emerges between ‘sustainable’ central cities seeking a ‘sustainability fix’ to their fiscal, environmental and quality of life problems, and more remote jurisdictions seeking to attract investment through low tax regimes and limited development regulation – what we label a ‘counter-sustainability fix’. These contrasting and dialectically related policies have substantial consequences for the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, calling into question policies that promote ‘sustainability in one place’.",2020-06-09,Urban Studies,https://openalex.org/V50366009,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098020919280,2241,2262,57,11,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035747921,https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098020919280,journal-article,3035747921

To reduce the requirement for the costly database training process, a three-step parametric model-based approach is proposed. This approach estimates the AP-device angle, distance, and the device location analytically by making use of wireless path-loss models, antenna radiation patterns, and differential RSS. Meanwhile, the differential antenna gain is introduced to eliminate the need for known AP-device distances when estimating the AP-device angle. Furthermore, to circumvent the difficulty in detecting outliers in a single-AP system, this paper further integrates single-AP solutions with dead-reckoning (DR) to obtain more robust solutions. Three types of measurement models (i.e., the device location updates, AP-device angle updates, and AP-device distance updates) are built from the single-AP localization system. Static and dynamic field tests with the new Bluetooth 5 signals indicated the possibility for using RSS from three directional antennas on single AP to obtain a low-cost localization solution and the effectiveness of integrating with DR on mitigating the impact of outliers.",2020-05-01,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,https://openalex.org/V10892749,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tim.2019.2922752,1860,1870,69,5,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2952595601,https://doi.org/10.1109/tim.2019.2922752,journal-article,2952595601

This paper focuses on MCB scheduling and proposes the blind and task-ware scheduling methods to prolong MCB lifetime. The first step into designing an efficacious method to schedule MCB is using an MBC battery model for computer simulations. To do so, this research introduces an MCB model based on Peukert law and recovery effect. The effect of different time steps on MCB lifetime is studied and it is shown that there is only one optimum time step for each discharge pattern that maximizes the MCB lifetime. In the next step, blind and task-ware scheduling are introduced for MCB management. The blind method uses a neural network time step estimator to find the optimum time step for MCB at different discharge currents without any contemplation about drawn current pattern, but the task-ware MCB scheduling method considers the discharge pattern and finds the best set of solutions during a specific time interval. The simulations show that the task-ware scheduling method extends the battery lifetime on average by 31% compared to blind method.",2020-06-01,"Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal",https://openalex.org/V2764510487,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2019.07.005,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962571744,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jestch.2019.07.005,journal-article,2962571744

We model the process of ED disposition decision prediction as a hierarchical multiclass classification while dealing with the progressive accrual of clinical information throughout the ED caregiving process. Multinomial logistic regression as well as machine learning models are built for carrying out the predictions. Utilizing results from just the first set of ED laboratory tests along with other prior information gathered for each patient (2.5 h ahead of the actual disposition decision on average), our model predicts disposition decisions with positive predictive values of 55.4%, 45.1%, 56.9%, and 47.5%, while controlling false positive rates (1.4%, 1.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%), with AUC values of 0.97, 0.95, 0.89, and 0.84 for the four admission (minor) classes, i.e., intensive care unit (3.6% of the testing samples), telemetry unit (2.2%), general practice unit (11.9%), and observation unit (6.6%) classes, respectively. Moreover, patients destined to intensive care unit present a more drastic increment in prediction quality at triage than others. Disposition decision classification models can provide more actionable information than a binary admission vs. discharge prediction model for the proactive initiation of admission processes for ED patients.

The large amount of metal in these stents, however, can lead to early and late thrombotic complications, and thus requires long-term antiplatelet agents. Bioabsorbable stents have been postulated to mitigate the risk of these complications. Here we present early data on the first self-expandable primarily bioabsorbable stent for aneurysms. Methods Braided stents were developed using poly-L-lactic acid fibers with material surface area similar to metal flow diverters. Crush resistance force, hemolysis, and thrombogenicity were determined and compared with existing commercial devices. Stents were deployed in infra-renal rabbit aortas to determine angiographic side branch patency and to study neointima formation for a 1-month follow-up period. Results Crush resistance force was determined to be on the order of existing commercial devices. Hemolytic behavior was similar to existing metal devices, and thrombogenicity was lower than metal flow-diverting stents. A smooth neointimal layer was found over the absorbable stent surface and all covered side branches were patent at follow-up. Conclusion The design of self-expanding primarily bioabsorbable flow-diverting stents is possible, and preliminary safety data is consistent with a favorable profile in terms of mechanical behavior, hemocompatibility, side branch patency, and histological effects.

This study characterized the reproducibility and repeatability of [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) positron emission tomography (PET) quantification of cardiac SNS innervation, regional denervation, and myocardial blood flow (MBF). Dynamic HED PET-CT scans were performed 47 ± 22 days apart in 20 patients with stable heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Three observers, blinded to clinical data, used FlowQuant® to evaluate the test-retest repeatability and inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of HED tracer uptake and clearance rates to measure global (LV-mean) retention index (RI), volume of distribution (VT), and MBF. Values were also compared with and without regional partial-volume correction. Regional denervation was quantified as %LV defect size of values < 75% of the LV-maximum. Test-retest repeatability and observer reproducibility were evaluated using intra-class-correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman coefficient of repeatability (NPC). Intra- and inter-observer correlations of both VT and RI were excellent (ICC = 0.93–0.99). Observer reproducibility (NPC = 3–13%) was lower than test-retest repeatability (NPC = 12–61%). Both regional (%LV defect size) and global (LV-mean) measures of sympathetic innervation were more repeatable using the simple RI model compared to VT (NPC = 12% vs. 19% and 30% vs. 54%). Using either model, quantification of regional denervation (defect size) was consistently more reliable than the global LV-mean values of RI or VT. Regional partial-volume correction degraded repeatability of both the global and regional VT measures by 2–12%. Test-retest repeatability of MBF estimation was relatively poor (NPC = 30–61%) compared with the RI.

The neurobiology of depression, and the mechanism of action of common antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is not well understood. One mechanism thought to underlie the effects of these drugs is upregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence indicates that vesicular zinc is required for modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, at least under some circumstances. Vesicular zinc refers to zinc that is stored in the synaptic vesicles of certain neurons, including in the hippocampus, and released in response to neuronal activity. It can be eliminated from the brain by deletion of zinc transporter  (ZnT3), as is the case in ZnT3 knockout mice. Here, we examined the effects of repeated social defeat stress and subsequent chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and neurogenesis in ZnT3 knockout mice. We hypothesized that fluoxetine treatment would increase neurogenesis and reverse stress-induced behavioral symptoms in wild type, but not ZnT3 knockout, mice. As anticipated, stress induced persistent depression-like effects, including social avoidance and anxiety-like behavior. Fluoxetine decreased social avoidance, though the effect was not specific to the stressed mice, but did not affect anxiety-like behavior. Surprisingly, stress increased the survival of neurons born  day after the last episode of defeat stress. Fluoxetine treatment also increased cell survival, particularly in wild type mice, though it did not affect proliferation. Our results did not support our hypothesis that vesicular zinc is required for the behavioral benefits of fluoxetine treatment. As to whether vesicular zinc is required for the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, our results were inconclusive, warranting further investigation into the role of vesicular zinc in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2020-06-01,Hippocampus,https://openalex.org/V55111660,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23185,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995220262,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.23185,journal-article,2995220262

Objective To compare the performance of recurrent neural networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gradient boosted trees, with logistic regression and feedforward neural networks. Methods The modeling dataset contained 354 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 200 and 2016. 10 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 4 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 404 predictors in total for each person. Model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The optimal recurrent neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8407), one-dimensional convolutional neural network configuration (AUC: 0.8419), and XGB model configuration (AUC: 0.8493) all outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179). In addition to superior discrimination, the optimal XGB model configuration also achieved superior calibration. Conclusions Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings. It appears that the XGB model class is the most promising in terms of discrimination, calibration, and computational expense.

However, there are limited data on the safety of IV tPA in this population. Methods and Results A retrospective observational study of patients ≥66 years of age linked to Medicare claims and treated with IV tPA at Get With The Guidelines–Stroke hospitals (February 200 to December 2015). We identified 29 patients treated with IV tPA who had a prior ischemic stroke within 3 months and 3 65 with no history of stroke. Patients with prior stroke had a higher stroke severity (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 11 [6–19] versus 11 [6–18]; absolute standardized difference, 11.2%) and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Patients with prior stroke had a higher unadjusted risk for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.7% versus 4.8%) and in-hospital mortality (12.6% versus 8.9%), but these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment. When stratified by prespecified time epochs, the elevated risk for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was seen only within the first 14 days (16.3% versus 4.8%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 1.62–8.43]) but not in other epochs (2.1% versus 4.8%; aOR, 0.3 [95% CI, 0.05–2.79] for 15–30 days and 7.4% versus 4.8%; aOR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.77–2.40] for 31–90 days). In addition, patients with prior stroke were significantly more likely to have a combined outcome of in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice (25.9% versus 17.0%; aOR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.21–2.38]), less likely to be discharged to home (28.3% versus 32.3%; aOR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.54–0.98]), or to have good functional outcomes at discharge (modified Rankin Scale, 0–1; 11.3% versus 20.0%; aOR, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.24–0.89]).

Higher DIN fluxes were recorded in spring and summer and their total fluxes (averaged 7.58 kg N ha-1) were similar to the critical loads in aquatic ecosystems. Significant differences of precipitation δ15N were observed for NH4+-N between town and wetland sites in spring and between urban and rural sites in summer. For NO3--N, significant differences of precipitation δ15N were observed between town and rural sites in spring and between urban and town sites in autumn, respectively. Quantitative results of NO3--N sources showed that both biomass burning and coal combustion had higher fluxes at the urban site especially in winter (0.18 ± 0.0 and 0.1 ± 0.0 kg N ha-1), which were about three times higher than those at the town site. A similar finding was observed for soil emission and vehicle exhausts in winter. On the whole, DIN wet deposition averaged at 12.13 kg N ha-1 yr-1 with the urban site as the hotspot (17.50 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and regional NO3--N fluxes had a seasonal pattern with minimum values in winter. The contribution to NO3--N wet deposition from biomass burning was 26.1 ± 14.1%, which is the second dominant factor lower than coal combustion (26.5 ± 12.6%) in the TGR area during spring and summer.

With this overview, we describe the underpinning assumptions, purposes, and potential pitfalls of data collection techniques and methods of data analysis in key qualitative research methodologies. Our aim is to enhance One Health collaborations involving qualitative researchers, veterinary epidemiologists, and veterinary economists. There exist several distinct traditions of qualitative research, from which we draw selectively for illustrative purposes. Notwithstanding important distinctions, we emphasize commonalities and the potential for collaborative impact. The most important commonality is a shared focus on contextualizing human behavior and experience-culturally, economically, historically, and socially. We demonstrate that in-depth attention to context can assist veterinary economists and epidemiologists in drawing lessons from the implementation of policies and programs. In other words, qualitative researchers can assist One Health teams in distilling insights from ""success stories,"" but also from adverse events and unintended consequences. As a result, qualitative researchers can contribute to One Health research and policy discussions by formulating more accurate and contextually-relevant parameters for future quantitative studies. When performed well, qualitative methodologies can help veterinary economists and epidemiologists to develop impactful research questions, to create more accurate and contextually-relevant parameters for quantitative studies, and to develop policy recommendations and interventions that are attuned to the political and socio-cultural context of their implementation.

On first-year sea ice (FYI), spatiotemporal variations in snow properties can cause the Ku-band main radar scattering horizon to appear above the snow/sea ice interface. This can increase the estimated sea ice freeboard by several centimeters, leading to FYI thickness overestimations. This article examines the expected changes in Ku-band main scattering horizon and its impact on FYI thickness estimates, with variations in snow temperature, salinity, and density derived from ten naturally occurring Arctic FYI Cases encompassing saline/nonsaline, warm/cold, simple/complexly layered snow (4–45 cm) overlying FYI (48–170 cm). Using a semi-empirical modeling approach, snow properties from these Cases are used to derive layer-wise brine volume and dielectric constant estimates, to simulate the Ku-band main scattering horizon and delays in radar propagation speed. Differences between modeled and observed FYI thickness are calculated to assess sources of error. Under both cold and warm conditions, saline snow covers are shown to shift the main scattering horizon above from the snow/sea ice interface, causing thickness retrieval errors. Overestimates in FYI thicknesses of up to 65% are found for warm, saline snow overlaying thin sea ice. Our simulations exhibited a distinct shift in the main scattering horizon when the snow layer densities became greater than 440 kg/m3, especially under warmer snow conditions.

A noninvasive, in-situ visualization of the floc formation and the consequent sediment microstructure via tri-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) can enable establishing the quantitative link between the flocculation conditions and bulk properties of the resulting sediment structures.A dual fluorescence/reflectance confocal imaging protocol is developed to non-invasively detect morphological changes in dense oil sands tailings during flocculation with an anionic polymer and the subsequent sediment compaction stages for three different polymer dosages. The image reconstruction is developed to quantify the organics/clay volume fractions in the sediment and the floc network characteristics through the pseudo fractal dimension which are related to the bulk rheological properties following a 5-day densification period.In-situ imaging of the flocculation process gives insights into the variable floc density and size at different stages of mixing. The acquired 3D images of the flocculated sediment reveal that bitumen remains within the flocs. The increase in the polymer dosage results in the reduction of the sediment fractality and strength attributed to the possible formation of more swelled floc structures.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are categorized by varying degrees of psychomotor, cognitive, affective, and volitional impairment (1). Many explain them in psychological terms without referring to an underlying neural substrate (2). This position may be traced to Freud's failed attempt to link neural mechanisms to psychodynamic concepts in his Project for a Scientific Psychology. It led him to abandon neurology in favor of psychoanalysis (3). Karl Jaspers later stated that biological and psychological investigations of the mind are like “the exploration of an unknown continent from opposite directions, where the explorers never meet because of the impenetrable country that intervenes (4).” Jaspers was not endorsing substance dualism, the theory that brain and mind are ontologically distinct material and immaterial substances (5). He was making an epistemological claim, noting that we have an incomplete understanding of the brain and mind and how they interact. Some contemporary psychiatrists seem to interpret the idea of biology and psychology coming from “opposite directions” as suggesting an epistemological and explanatory dualism between neural and mental processes. This appears to be part of an “identity crisis” in psychiatry reflecting disagreement about characterizing psychiatric disorders as disorders of the mind or brain (6). Dualism as such does not preclude mind-brain interaction. But it supports the position that mind and brain can be functionally distinct. I argue that this is not consistent with neuroscience research showing the extent to which mental and neural processes are interdependent and influence each other in maintaining mental health or causing mental illness. Dualistic thinking of the type I have described can limit therapeutic interventions for patients suffering from major psychiatric disorders.",2020-03-03,Frontiers in Psychiatry,https://openalex.org/V92766711,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00085,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009969424,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00085,journal-article,3009969424

Methods: Data from Alberta inpatient stroke rehabilitation units were examined to determine: (1) the impact of sex on time to inpatient rehabilitation, functional gains (using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)), length of stay (LOS), and discharge destination; (2) if sex was related to age at the time of stroke, stroke severity, and living arrangement at discharge from rehabilitation; and (3) whether patients’ age and preadmission living arrangement had an influence on LOS in rehabilitation or discharge destination. Results: Two thousand two hundred sixty-six adult stroke patients (128 males and 98 females) were subcategorized as mild (FIM &gt;80; n = 1155), moderate (FIM 40–80; n = 994), or severe (FIM &lt;40; n = 117). Fifty-five percent of males (45.7% females) had mild stroke; 39.5% of males (49.5% females) had moderate stroke; and 5.5% of males (4.8% females) had severe stroke. Females were significantly older than males ( p = 2.4 × 10 − ). No sex difference existed in time from acute care to rehabilitation admission ( p = 0.73) or in mean FIM change ( p = 0.294).

This numerical method is efficient, optimally convergent, conserving the mass, convenient to implement, flexible for mesh refinement, and easy to handle complex geometries with different types of boundary conditions. We rigorously prove the mass conservation property and the discrete energy dissipation for the proposed fully discrete discontinuous finite volume element scheme.

Traditional teaching has relied on the use of cadavers; however, this method is resource-intensive and does not allow for repeated practice. Virtual reality surgical training is a growing field that is increasingly being adopted in Otolaryngology. CardinalSim is a virtual reality temporal bone surgical simulator that offers a high-quality, inexpensive adjunct to traditional teaching methods. The objective of this study was to establish the face and content validity of CardinalSim through a national study. Methods Otolaryngologists and resident trainees from across Canada were recruited to evaluate CardinalSim. Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. A face and content validity questionnaire with questions categorized into 1 domains was distributed to participants following simulator use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe questionnaire results, and either Chi-square or Fishers exact tests were used to compare responses between junior residents, senior residents, and practising surgeons. Results Sixty-two participants from thirteen different Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery programs were included in the study (3 practicing surgeons; 3 resident trainees). Face validity was achieved for 5 out of  domains, while content validity was achieved for 5 out of  domains. Significant differences between groups  p -value of &lt; 0.05) were found for one face validity domain (realistic ergonomics, p = 0.002) and two content validity domains (teaching drilling technique, p = 0.011 and overall teaching utility, p = 0.006). The assessment scores, global rating scores, and overall attitudes towards CardinalSim, were universally positive. Open-ended questions identified limitations of the simulator. Conclusion CardinalSim met acceptable criteria for face and content validity.

Method: A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the prescribing of ADHD medications between 2005 and 2015 using electronic medical record data. Yearly prevalence and incidence of ADHD medication prescribing were calculated for preschoolers (up to  years old), school-aged children (6-17 years old), and adults (18-65 years old) along with a description of the types of ADHD medications prescribed between 2005 and 2015. Results: Between 2005 and 2015, there was a 2.6-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD medication prescribing to preschoolers, a 2.5-fold increase in school-aged children, and a fourfold increase in adults. There was a corresponding rise in incidence of prescribing although this rise was moderate and estimates were much lower compared with prevalence. The most commonly prescribed medication was Methylphenidate (65.0% of all ADHD medications prescribed).

The study is supported by bench scale degradation experiments on VEN. Results demonstrated that UV can completely degrade VEN, but the addition of H2O2 increased pseudo first order rate constant by up to 2.5 times. Extrapolations of the lab data indicated that removal rates of VEN at the UV disinfection unit of a typical municipal WWTP are approximately 0.4% at standard operating conditions. With the addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2, degradation of VEN can be increased by ten times over existing UV treatment.

This report presents a case of MES and reviews common clinical presentations, hematological trends, and patient outcomes. This study was a combined case report and review of published cases of MES. Cases were identified using Medline and EMBASE databases. Binomial statistics were used to compare clinical characteristics among patients with MES. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to compare hematological values across time points (Canadian Task Force Classification III). A total of 57 cases of MES were reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 48.7 years. Commonly reported signs or symptoms at presentation include abdominopelvic distension or mass (93%), skin discolouration (33%), and menstrual irregularities (25%). There was no difference in parity (P = 0.42), menopausal status (P = 0.87), or hydronephrosis on imaging (P = 0.48) among patients.

Years of life lost (YLL) was calculated according to Canadian life tables. A new measure, average lifespan shortened (ALSS), was calculated as a ratio of YLL over the expected lifespan.During the period of interest, decreases in age standardized rates of death adjusted to the World Standard Population were observed mainly among men. The adjusted YLL rates remained unchanged with respect to oral cancers in women, but slightly decreased for oral cancers in men and for laryngeal cancers in both sexes. Our new measure of ALSS showed that in 1980, patients with oral cancers lost an average of 20% of their lifespan, whereas in 2010, men and women still lost approximately 20% and 18%, respectively. Patients with laryngeal cancers lost 18% of their lifespan in both sexes in 1980 and 17% in 2010. The ALSS subanalysis showed that the largest gain of lifespan was observed for cancers of the hypopharynx in men and for cancers of the floor of mouth and nasopharynx in women.There appears to be modest improvements in premature mortality due to head and neck cancers in Canada over a 30-year period, with the exception of oral cancers in men.

Since CD38 is expressed by different hematopoietic elements, DARA has the potential to interfere with flow cytometric assessment of bone marrow specimens. Methods Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow samples from 1 PCM on DARA and  control samples was performed using two different antibody panels. Results Bone marrow samples from PCM patients on DARA exhibited a population of CD19+ CD10+ B-lymphoid cells with kappa light chain restriction. Further morphological and immunophenotypic studies suggested that this population represents marrow hematogones. Marrow hematogones from control samples showed normal immunophenotypic profiles. Conclusion DARA on the surface of hematogones interferes with flow cytometric clonality study leading to artifactual kappa light chain restriction, which can result in false interpretation of a concurrent clonal B-cell proliferation.

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the mental health status of postsecondary students 1 to 2 years old from 201 to 201 and (2) to compare the mental health status of postsecondary students to nonstudents. Methods: Prevalence was estimated for a set of mental health outcomes using seven annual iterations of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2011 to 2017). Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratio estimates comparing mental health status among postsecondary students and nonstudents, adjusting for age and sex. Random effects metaregression and meta-analyses techniques were used to evaluate trends in prevalence and odds ratio estimates over time. Results: Over the study period, the prevalence of perceived low mental health, diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, and past-year mental health consultations increased among female students, whereas binge drinking decreased among male students. With the exception of perceived stress, the odds of experiencing each mental health outcome were lower among postsecondary students compared to nonstudents. Conclusions: These findings do not support the idea that postsecondary students have worse mental health than nonstudents of similar age.

The height (H) and diameter (D) of the MPFs are both 0.1 mm. Two horizontal (SL) and vertical (ST) distances of 0.15 and 0.3 mm are considered with each type of arrangement, which results in four in-line and four staggered configurations. The simulations are run at five Reynolds numbers (Re) between 2 and 150, and a constant heat flux (HF) of 30 W cm−2 was applied through the bottom surface of the MHS as well as the liquid interacting surfaces of MPFs. The results are analyzed using four evaluative parameters, namely pressure drop, friction factor (FF), Nusselt number (Nu) and thermal–hydraulic performance index (TPI). These parameters were significantly affected by the wake length behind MPFs. In cases with a large horizontal pitch ratio (SL/D = 3), the wake length behind all columns (except the last one) could extend more (up to 2D) which in cases with the in-line arrangement typically resulted in higher pressure drop and FF (up to 10%) compared to similar cases with SL/D = 1.5. In cases with ST/D = 3, the larger available cross section among MPFs typically resulted in lower pressure drop (up to 36%) and Nu (up to 8%) compared to similar cases with ST/D = 1.5. With the same SL/D and ST/D, staggered arrangements generally had higher pressure drop, FF and Nu (up to 56, 3 and 9%, respectively) compared to similar in-line arrangements. Finally, the best TPI was attained with staggered arrangements with ST/D = 1.5 with 10% higher TPI compared to the reference case.",2020-05-01,Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry,https://openalex.org/V58867329,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-019-08840-2,1057,1068,140,3,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975549593,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10973-019-08840-2,journal-article,2975549593

Assessment of biomarkers may reveal subsets of patients who are responsive to nutraceutical treatment, which may facilitate a personalized approach to treating depression. This is a post hoc analysis of an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (n = 158) investigating a combination nutraceutical comprising Omega-3 (EPA 1 g/DHA 656 mg), SAMe, zinc, 5-HTP, folinic acid, and co-factors versus placebo for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. The study explored levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, homocysteine, and BDNF as possible predictors and correlates of response to nutraceutical supplementation. Concentrations of EPA and DHA in red cell membranes increased in response to treatment and were significantly correlated with a decrease in depressive symptoms during active treatment (p = 0.003 and p = 0.029; respectively). Higher baseline levels of omega-6 fatty acid also correlated with depression reduction in the active treatment group ( p = 0.011).

Earlier delivery, when fetuses are smaller, may reduce these risks. This study aimed to evaluate the week-specific risks of maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality to assist with obstetrical decision making. Material and methods In this population-based cohort study, women with type 1 diabetes (n = 5889), type 2 diabetes (n = 9422) and gestational diabetes (n = 13 917) and a comparison group without diabetes (n = 2 55 243) who delivered a singleton infant at ≥36 completed weeks of gestation between 200 and 201 were identified from the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the week-specific rates of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality among women delivered iatrogenically vs those undergoing expectant management. Results For all women, the absolute risk of severe maternal morbidity/mortality was low, typically impacting less than 1% of women, and there was no significant difference in gestational age-specific severe maternal morbidity/mortality between iatrogenic delivery and expectant management among women with any form of diabetes. Among women with gestational diabetes, iatrogenic delivery was associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity/mortality compared with expectant management at 3 and 3 weeks' gestation (76.7 and 27. excess cases per 100 deliveries, respectively) and a lower risk of neonatal morbidity/mortality at 38, 3 and 4 weeks' gestation (7.9, 27. and 15.9 fewer cases per 100 deliveries, respectively). Increased risks of severe neonatal morbidity following iatrogenic delivery compared with expectant management were also observed for women with type 1 diabetes at 3 (98.3 excess cases per 100 deliveries) and 3 weeks' gestation (44.5 excess cases per 100 deliveries) and for women with type 2 diabetes at 3 weeks' gestation (77.9 excess cases per 100 deliveries) weeks.

Typically, surrogate measures were used to approximate the movement of pronation showing inconsistent results due to the high variability in the methodology and protocols. This study determines the relationships between all identified pronation variables and aims to reduce the data set to its dominant factors.Cross-sectional.Forty barefoot participants (14 F, 26 M) performed four standing tasks (subneutral, bipedal, single-leg with 20° and single-leg with 30° knee flexion), over ground walking (1.5m/s) and running (3.5m/s) trials. Manual assessment data, motion capture data, ground reaction forces, and plantar pressure distributions were collected. Sixty-one commonly used pronation measures were compared using Spearman Correlations and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA).Two groups of correlated variables were found, 4.2% of them correlated mainly with the longitudinal arch angle (LAA), the other 10.2% correlated with the Achilles tendon angle (β). The remaining 85.6% were not significantly correlated to each other.The LAA is representative for the movement of the mid foot and β quantifies rear foot eversion relative to the shank. Since these dominant variables varied independently from each other, both cannot quantify pronation simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to consider and report both, LAA-pronation and β-pronation separately to represent prevalent foot movement properties. Separately assessing the two dominant underlying mechanisms of foot movement may lead to improved guidelines for clinical screening and footwear manufacturing.",2020-04-01,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport,https://openalex.org/V150894996,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.11.002,,,,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2987493643,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2019.11.002,journal-article,2987493643

Prenatal anxiety is predictive of postnatal anxiety which can interfere with the security of maternal-child attachment and further raise the risk of child behavior problems. Secure maternal-child attachment is essential for optimal emotional health. Sex influences the type of behavior problem experienced. There is a gap in understanding whether attachment security and the sex of the child can moderate association between prenatal anxiety and children’s behavioral problems. Purpose To examine the association between prenatal anxiety and child behavioral problems and to test the moderating effects of attachment security and child sex on the association between prenatal anxiety and child behavioral problems. Methods Secondary analysis of data from 182 mothers and their children, enrolled in the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition Study using Hayes' (2013) conditional process modeling. Results Prenatal anxiety was associated with both externalizing ( b = −0.53; standard error ( SE) = 0.20; p = 0.009) and internalizing ( b = −0.32; SE = 0.13; p = 0.01) behaviors only in children with an insecure style of attachment.

The evolution of highly specialized limb morphology may result in loss of evolvability, that is, in a decreased capacity of the locomotor skeleton to evolve in response to selection towards alternative ecomorphological niches. Using evolutionary simulations, I show that the highly specialized limb anatomy of hominoids is associated with a significant loss of evolvability, defined as the number of generations to reach alternative adaptive peaks, and in parallel an increased risk of extinction, particularly in simulated evolution toward generalized quadrupedal limb proportions. Loss of evolvability in apes and humans correlates with three factors: (1) decreased correlation among limb bone lengths (i.e., integration), which slows the rate of change along lines of least evolutionary resistance; (2) limb specialization, which places apes and humans in relatively remote areas of morphospace; and (3) increased skeletal size as a proxy for body size. Thus, locomotor over-specialization can lead to evolutionary dead-ends that significantly increase the probability of hominoid populations going extinct before evolving new adaptive morphologies.",2020-01-09,Evolution,https://openalex.org/V87560609,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13900,702,715,74,4,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996735064,https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13900,journal-article,2996735064

We aimed to investigate how ecological factors, social factors, and reproductive state are associated with energetic condition in a wild neotropical primate using non-invasive measures. We first assessed and compared urinary C-peptide levels (uCP), the presence of urinary ketones (uKet), and behaviorally assessed energy balance (bEB) in female white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus imitator) living in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. Then, we assessed how these measures were associated with feeding competition, dominance rank, and reproductive state. As predicted, uCP and bEB were positively associated with each other, and bEB was negatively associated with uKet. However, we did not find a relationship between uCP and uKet. Females showed lower uCP and bEB values during periods of intense feeding competition, but this relationship was not dependent on dominance rank. Furthermore, rank was not directly associated with uCP and bEB. Urinary ketones, on the other hand, were only produced in the most adverse conditions: by low-ranking, lactating females during periods of intense feeding competition. Behavioral strategies are assumed to maximize reproductive success and not energetic condition per se, which might explain why rank was not generally associated with energetic condition in our study population.

Particular emphasis is here given to the need of identifying the fourth-order magnetostriction tensor, as it represents the most primitive object from which all related physical quantities of interest in micromagnetism are deduced. For hexagonal crystals, the magnetostriction tensor is expressed in terms of six independent magnetostrictive coefficients whose values are, so far, unknown. Indeed, the existing literature provides just four independent constraints that are extracted from the expression of the differential scalar strain in a given direction. In this work, the two extra conditions required to solve this identification problem are obtained by deducing the explicit functional dependence of the main features characterizing the motion of a magnetic domain wall along the major axis of a thin magnetostrictive nanostrip placed on the top of a thick piezoelectric actuator. The results of our analysis reveal that such two conditions may be associated to the effective anisotropy coefficient and the domain-wall width.

Here we use a psbA amplicon library and high-throughput 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the effects of time and CO2 concentration on the composition and community dynamics of photoautotrophically grown microalgal biofilms pre-conditioned with wastewater and heavily seeded with the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. While biomass increased in a stable, linear manner, our analysis revealed that the photoautotrophic community dramatically changed over time. Photoautotrophs such as Chorella and the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya, presumably seeded from the wastewater, rapidly established as constituents of the biofilm while the seed species was far less dominant than anticipated. With time, photoautotrophic diatoms and dinoflagellates also established themselves as constituents of the biofilm. Low CO2 (0.04% v/v) favoured the early proliferation of cyanobacteria while high CO2 (12%) delayed, but did not prevent the proliferation. In addition, a phylogenetically diverse array of heterotrophic α-, β- and γ-proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes along with a selection of eukaryotic microorganisms inhabited the biofilms. Principal coordinate analyses reveal unique clustering patterns indicating that the composition of the initial and the final microbial communities were distinctly different from one another. Alpha diversity measures indicated that the 16S (prokaryotic) community peaked around day 1 / 1 at both 0.04% and 12% CO2. However, unlike the 18S (eukaryotic) community where diversity was at a maximum at the end of the 26-day time-course, prokaryotic diversity achieved minimum values, particularly for biofilms grown at 0.04% CO2, where the cyanobacteria proliferated.

A wet (high water table) and dry (low water table) area were identified at the site and plots with cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) or bare peat were established in each area. Plant growth, peat and porewater dissolved C (DOC) and N (TDN), microbial biomass and the emissions of CO2 and CH4 were monitored at the plots throughout the growing season. The largest concentrations of DOC were measured in dry and bare sites. Lower E2:E3 ratios suggested a higher aromaticity of the DOC at these sites that were net sources of CO2 and CH4. The concentration of TDN was greater in plots with cottongrass and high water table, supporting a more abundant microbial biomass. Cottongrass dominated plots also had larger gas emissions as compared to bare plots even though they were net C sinks due to their high photosynthetic rates. Maintaining a high water table is key to reducing peatland C losses. While vascular plant presence seems to prime the release of N and greenhouse gases, the inputs of C exceeded the losses and recovered the C sink function of the peatland ecosystem in the short term. Carbon inputs are maximized under high water table and plant presence.",2020-03-01,Plant and Soil,https://openalex.org/V11781297,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04434-2,299,313,448,1-2,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003430127,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04434-2,journal-article,3003430127

This retrospective study included twelve osteosarcoma and eight Ewing sarcoma MRI studies performed prior to any therapeutic intervention. All cases were histopathologically confirmed. Three radiologists used 3D-Slicer software to perform manual segmentation of bone sarcomas in a blinded and independent manner. One radiologist segmented manually and also performed semiautomatic segmentation with the GrowCut tool. Segmentation exercises were timed for comparison. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to evaluate similarity between the segmentation results and further statistical analyses were performed to compare DSC, HD, and volumetric results. Manual segmentation was reproducible with intraobserver DSC varying from 0.8 to 0.97 and HD from 3.3 to 28.73 mm. Interobserver DSC of manual segmentation showed variation from 0.7 to 0.97 and HD from 3.9 to 33.40 mm. Semiautomatic segmentation compared to manual segmentation resulted in DSCs of 0.71-0.96 and HDs of 5.38-31.54 mm. Semiautomatic segmentation required significantly less time compared to manual segmentation (P value ≤0.05). Among all situations compared, tumor volumetry did not show significant statistical differences (P value >0.05).

Although pharmacological agents are the mainstay of treatment for seizure control, an unyielding 30-40% of patients remain refractory to these medications and continue to experience spontaneous recurrent seizures with attendant life-long cognitive, behavioural, and mental health issues, as well as an increased risk for sudden unexpected death. Despite over eight decades of antiseizure drug (ASD) discovery and the approval of dozens of new medications, the percentage of this refractory population remains virtually unchanged, suggesting that drugs with new and unexpected mechanisms of action are needed. In this brief review, we discuss the need for new animal models of epilepsy, with a particular focus on the advantages and disadvantages of zebrafish. We also outline the evidence that epilepsy is characterized by derangements in mitochondrial function and introduce the rationale and promise of bioenergetics as a functional readout assay to uncover novel ASDs. We also consider limitations of a zebrafish metabolism-based drug screening approach. Our goal is to discuss the opportunities and challenges of further development of mitochondrial screening strategies for the development of novel ASDs.

Coproculture revealed cyathostomes, Strongylus equinus, S. edentatus, and S. vulgaris, with S. equinus (unusually) dominating in adult horses and cyathostomes dominating in young horses (<3 years of age). We examined 3 horses found dead in the springs of 201 and 2018, as well as fecal samples from live horses in spring (n = 45) and summer 201 (n = 236) using McMaster fecal flotation and Baermann larval sedimentation on fresh samples, and modified Wisconsin flotation and sucrose gradient immunofluorescent assay for Giardia and Cryptosporidium on frozen samples. Mean strongyle fecal egg counts were 66 eggs per gram (EPG) in dead horses, 68 EPG in live horses in spring, and 110 EPG in summer; domestic horses are usually treated at counts exceeding 20 EPG. Adult horses (unusually) had patent infections with the lungworm Dictyocaulus arnfieldi and ascarids (Parascaris spp.), and in spring, dead horses had  times higher odds of having patent ascarid infections than live horses, likely due to malnutrition and corresponding immunodeficiency. Fecal prevalence and intensity of D. arnfieldi and Parascaris spp. were significantly higher in young horses, and in spring versus summer. A higher proportion of fecal samples were positive for strongyle and ascarid eggs using a centrifugal flotation technique on previously frozen feces, as compared to a passive flotation method on fresh feces. Eggs of the tapeworm Paranoplocephala mamillana were present in fecal samples from 28% of live, and 42% of dead, horses in spring. This research represents several new geographic records (S. edentatus, D. arnfieldi, and Eimeria leuckarti), provides insight into unusual patterns of parasite epidemiology in a nutrition-limited environment, and has conservation and biosecurity implications for this unique equine population, as well as for parasite management in domestic horses.",2020-02-05,International journal for parasitology.

These two processes have an important significance in evolution of living tissues. The presented formulation incorporates both the volumetric growth and mass flux phenomena into the modeling with the aid of the micromorphic theory’s capability to include internal structures in materials. The balance equation of microinertia is presented which reveals the importance of rearrangement and alteration of microstructure in the micromorphic material growth. Within the framework of material uniformity, the evolution laws are derived in terms of first-order differential equations for a set of material transplants which satisfy the formal restrictions arising from micromorphic material symmetries, and are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

NIS also transports other monovalent anions such as tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), pertechnetate (TcO4-), and thiocyanate (SCN-), and is competitively inhibited by perchlorate (ClO4-). However, the mechanisms of substrate selectivity and inhibitor sensitivity are poorly understood. Here, a comparative approach was taken to determine whether naturally evolved NIS proteins exhibit variability in their substrate transport properties. The NIS proteins of thirteen animal species were initially assessed, and three species from environments with differing iodide availability, freshwater species Danio rerio (zebrafish), saltwater species Balaenoptera acutorostrata scammoni (minke whale), and non-aquatic mammalian species Homo sapiens (human) were studied in detail. NIS genes from each of these species were lentivirally transduced into HeLa cells, which were then characterized using radioisotope uptake assays, 125I- competitive substrate uptake assays, and kinetic assays. Homology models of human, minke whale and zebrafish NIS were used to evaluate sequence-dependent impact on the organization of Na+ and I- binding pockets. Whereas each of the three proteins that were analyzed in detail concentrated iodide to a similar degree, their sensitivity to perchlorate inhibition varied significantly: minke whale NIS was the least impacted by perchlorate inhibition (IC50 = 4.599 μM), zebrafish NIS was highly sensitive (IC50 = 0.081 μM), and human NIS showed intermediate sensitivity (IC50 = 1.566 μM). Further studies with fifteen additional substrates and inhibitors revealed similar patterns of iodide uptake inhibition, though the degree of 125I- uptake inhibition varied with each compound. Kinetic analysis revealed whale NIS had the lowest Km-I and the highest Vmax-I. Conversely, zebrafish NIS had the highest Km and lowest Vmax. Again, human NIS was intermediate. Molecular modeling revealed a high degree of conservation in the putative ion binding pockets of NIS proteins from different species, which suggests the residues responsible for the observed differences in substrate selectivity lie elsewhere in the protein. Ongoing studies are focusing on residues in the extracellular loops of NIS as determinants of anion specificity. These data demonstrate significant transport differences between the NIS proteins of different species, which may be influenced by the unique physiological needs of each organism. Our results also identify naturally-existing NIS proteins with significant variability in substrate transport kinetics and inhibitor sensitivity, which suggest that the affinity and selectivity of NIS for certain substrates can be altered for biotechnological and clinical applications.

The objective of this study was to estimate associations between the frequency of cannabis use and the presence of elevated internalizing (e.g., anxiety and depression) and externalizing (e.g., conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) symptoms within Ontario youth aged 12–17 years. Methods The 2014 Ontario Child Health Study included Emotional and Behavioural Scales used to assess internalizing and externalizing symptoms. To assess associations between internalizing/externalizing symptoms and cannabis use, the Ontario Child Health Study-Emotional and Behavioural Scales were dichotomized using the upper quintile (those with the most severe symptoms). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) to quantify the association between the frequency of cannabis use and the presence of elevated internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Estimates used a recommended procedure (replicate bootstrap weighting) to address design effects. Results A significant association between frequent cannabis use and elevated externalizing symptoms was observed with an OR of 2.1 (1.80–2.62) in males and 5.13 (4.24–6.21) in females. Similar significant associations were also observed between frequent cannabis use and elevated internalizing symptoms with an OR of 2.0 (1.74–2.47) in males and an OR of 3.40 (2.73–4.24) in females. These associations were still present after adjusting for age, binge drinking, smoking, and negative/positive parenting.

Previous experimental studies on natural convection from rectangular fins on horizontal surfaces have shown that maximum heat transfer per unit base area occurs within a narrow range of fin spacing in tall fins, and over a wider range of fin spacing in shallow fins. However, the heat transfer and flow characteristics of optimum fin configurations and the combined effects of fin geometrical parameters have not been sufficiently scrutinized in the literature. This work is primarily focused on characterizing the optimum heat transfer and flow patterns using three-dimensional, steady-state, laminar, conjugate heat transfer simulations, which serve as the fundamental basis for determining optimum fins. The main fin design parameters are the fin spacing, height, and length. Multi-parametric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) optimization was conducted to determine the combined effects of fin spacing, height, and length on heat transfer. To find a global optimum fin design, we performed a multi-parametric optimization using the dynamic-Q algorithm, rather than through a single parameter variation as is commonly done in previous studies. It was found that the fin spacing, height, and length strongly affect the flow through the fin channel ends, and hence the temperature gradient and heat transfer rate from the fin surfaces. The results demonstrate that the dynamic-Q optimization could efficiently find the global optimum CFD solutions for the design objectives: the maximum heat transfer per unit base area and the maximum heat transfer per unit base area and fin weight. The results are validated through the experimental results available for typical fin designs, as well as an experimental measurement of an example fin design in this work.",2020-06-01,Thermal science and engineering progress,https://openalex.org/V4210220034,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2020.100484,100484,100484,17,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009158332,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2020.100484,journal-article,3009158332

Under increasing pressure, sustainability of FC’s unpaid care work has become a pressing issue. Using qualitative data, this paper explores FCs’ care-related work goals, and describes how those goals do, or do not, link to technology. Methods We employed a sequential mixed-method approach using focus groups followed by an online survey about FCs’ goals. We held 1 focus groups and recruited 2 FCs through a mix of convenience and snowball sampling strategies. Carer organizations helped us recruit 59 FCs from across Canada to complete an online survey. Participants’ responses to an open-ended question in the survey were included in our qualitative analysis. An inductive approach was employed using qualitative thematic content analysis methods to examine and interpret the resulting data. We used NVIVO 1 software for data analysis. Results We identified two care quality improvement goals of FCs providing care to older adults: enhancing and safeguarding their caregiving capacity. To enhance their capacity to care, FCs sought: 1) foreknowledge about their care recipients’ changing condition, and 2) improved navigation of existing support systems. To safeguard their own wellbeing, and so to preserve their capacity to care, FCs sought to develop coping strategies as well as opportunities for mentorship and socialization. Conclusions We conclude that a paradigm shift is needed to reframe caregiving from a current deficit frame focused on failures and limitations (burden of care) towards a more empowering frame (sustainability and resiliency). The fact that FCs are seeking strategies to enhance and safeguard their capacities to provide care means they are approaching their unpaid care work from the perspective of resilience. Their goals and technology suggestions imply a shift from understanding care as a source of ‘burden’ towards a more ‘resilient’ and ‘sustainable’ model of caregiving. Our case study findings show that technology can assist in fostering this resiliency but that it may well be limited to the role of an intermediary that connects FCs to information, supports and peers.",2020-02-27,BMC Geriatrics,https://openalex.org/V14643628,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x,,,20,1,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009205317,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x,journal-article,3009205317

In this study, we present the first systematic survey and EDXRF characterization of 86 samples from the two inselbergs that conform Naibor Soit. Samples are classified into nine macroscopic varieties and are mineralogically composed of quartz, muscovite, occasional hematite, rutile, magnetite, anhydrite, and fuchsite. Geochemical analyses, which include previously published data, confirm the existence of inter-/intra-outcrop variability and suggest compositional similarities among some areas of both inselbergs.

Resistance to ML drugs is well documented in D. immitis; however, there remains a paucity of information on the spatial distribution and prevalence of resistant isolates. This project aims to improve understanding of ML-resistance by using a population genetic approach. We developed a large panel of microsatellite loci and identified 1 novel highly polymorphic markers. These 12, and five previously published markers were used to screen pools of microfilariae from 1 confirmed drug-susceptible, 2 confirmed drug-resistant, and from 1 suspected drug-resistant field isolates. In isolates where microfilarial suppression testing indicated resistance, Spatial Principal Component Analysis (sPCoA), Neighbor Joining Trees and Bayesian clustering all revealed high genetic similarity between pre- and post-treatment samples. Somewhat surprisingly, the Neighbor Joining tree and sPCoA generated using pairwise Nei's distances did not reveal clustering for resistant isolates, nor did it reveal state-level geographic clustering from samples collected in Georgia, Louisiana or Mississippi. In contrast, Discriminant Analysis of Principle Components was able to discriminate between susceptible, suspected-resistant and resistant samples. However, no resistance-associated markers were detected, and this clustering was driven by the combined effects of multiple alleles across multiple loci. Additionally, we measured unexpectedly large genetic distances between different passages of laboratory strains that originated from the same source infection. This finding strongly suggests that the genetic makeup of laboratory isolates can change substantially with each passage, likely due to genetic bottlenecking. Taken together, these data suggest greater than expected genetic variability in the resistant isolates, and in D. immitis overall. Our results also suggest that microsatellite genotyping lacks the sensitivity to detect a specific genetic signature for resistance.

To identify factors that contribute to this impairment, we compared the immune cell response in young vs. aged animals following nerve injury. First, we confirmed that macrophage accumulation is delayed in aged injured nerves which is due to defects in monocyte migration as a result of defects in site-specific recruitment signals in the aged nerve. Interestingly, impairment in both macrophage accumulation and functional recovery could be overcome by transplanting bone marrow from aged animals into young mice. That is, upon exposure to a youthful environment, monocytes/macrophages originating from the aged bone marrow behaved similarly to young cells. Transcriptional profiling of aged macrophages following nerve injury revealed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were largely downregulated in aged compared to young macrophages. One ligand of particular interest was macrophage-associated secreted protein (MCP1), which exhibited a potent role in regulating aged axonal regrowth in vitro. Given that macrophage-derived MCP1 is significantly diminished in the aged injured nerve, our data suggest that age-associated defects in MCP1 signaling could contribute to the regenerative deficits that occur in the aged nervous system.",2020-06-12,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V118428158,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00174,,,12,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035486999,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00174,journal-article,3035486999

Electrodes were produced by a hybrid manufacturing process that included vacuum filtration, intensive pulsed light (IPL) sintering, mechanical hot pressing and heat treatment to reduce the number of junctions and flatten the components into a parallel arrangement. Copper provides excellent electrical conductivity and cost efficiency, but it can be easily oxidized. CNC is a renewable material that acts as a strong binder, allowing the compaction of the electrodes and providing a surface for copper ions to be adsorbed. GNP prevents copper oxidation and acts as conductive bridges. This combination of processes and materials yielded decreases in electrical resistance, even after 5 days of heat treatment at 175 °C that would typically cause oxidation. At this temperature, carbonization of CNC began to occur. After applying a two percent strain to the electrodes, high CNC concentration electrodes maintained a similar electrical performance, whereas low CNC concentration electrodes exhibited a significant reduction in electrical conductivity.

The work is a case study in connection with the proposed Kiggavik project in Nunavut, Canada. A major challenge in simulating fluid flow through partially frozen porous media is how to define the transient hydraulic conductivity as a function of temperature. An indirect approach based on the similarity between soil freezing and soil–water characteristic curves for unsaturated soils is implemented to define the relation between unfrozen water content and cryogenic suction which is linked to temperature by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. Richard’s equation is then used to model fluid flow in partially frozen ground conditions. Finite element numerical modelling results of a worst-case climate change scenario indicate that although the permafrost could disappear completely in about 75 years with an increase in $$7\,^{\circ }$$C in the mean annual ground surface temperature during the next 10 years, the groundwater level around tailings facility would be approximately 3 m below ground surface.

A detailed investigation of cores and fluid inclusions from different intervals, i.e. S1k3−3, S1k3−1, S1k1, has been carried out using petrographic analysis, gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry and micro–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Three hydrocarbon charge events in the Kepingtage Formation have been recognized associated with the late Caledonian, late Hercynian and Himalayan orogenies. In the late Caledonian, oils were charged into the S1k3−3, S1k3−1 and S1k1 intervals, but evolved to solid bitumen due to biodegradation and water washing, as the Silurian strata have experienced both strong uplift and erosion during the early Hercynian Orogeny, and the influence of igneous intrusions during the Permian. Hydrocarbons associated with the Caledonian contain no regular steranes, diasteranes, hopanes or extended tricyclic terpanes due to in-reservoir thermal cracking. The second charge period occurred in the late Hercynian, which has experienced severe biodegradation and water washing. Hydrocarbons of this period are characterized by an obvious chromatographic hump of the unresolved complex mixture (UCM) coupled with petroleum inclusions that fluoresce light-blue and yellow, possibly indicating variable maturity. Whether or not high maturity oil charged during this period into the S1k1 interval has commercial production value needs further investigation. The third change occurred during the Himalayan Orogeny. Highly mature hydrocarbons were emplaced into the S1k3−3, S1k3−1 and S1k1 intervals with the S1k1 interval as being the most significant. Biodegradation, water washing, and igneous intrusion had no impact on hydrocarbons charged during this period, resulting in higher potential for economic production.",2020-01-01,Marine and Petroleum Geology,https://openalex.org/V93565542,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.08.013,202,218,111,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968053712,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2019.08.013,journal-article,2968053712

Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether assessing NIRS and FMD simultaneously or non-simultaneously would affect this association. Thirty-five healthy young individuals (26 ± 1 years old) participated in the study. Twenty were submitted to a simultaneous NIRS/FMD test (NIRS probe placed below the cuff during FMD test) and fifteen to a non-simultaneous FMD and NIRS intervention (NIRS test performed 2 min after FMD).

This non-monotonic behavior, attributed to the shear banding, was also observed in up and down stress ramp data. The results of the controlled stress and controlled strain rheometry modes coincided well at high values of stress and shear rates due to the reduced effect of stick-slip phenomenon and elastic deformation.

It is unknown whether elderly patients without implanted devices have a similar prevalence of undiagnosed AF using non-invasive ECG monitoring, and if this approach to screening in this population is cost-effective. Methods Individuals ≥80 years old attending outpatient clinics without a history of AF and with hypertension and one additional risk factor underwent 30 days of continuous ECG monitoring with an option for an additional 30 days of monitoring if no AF was detected.

Escherichia coli is recovered in the sputum of up to 25% of patients with CF, yet little is known about the epidemiology or clinical impact of infection.We studied patients attending a Canadian adult CF clinic who had positive sputum cultures for E coli from 1978 to 2016. Infection was categorized as transient or persistent (≥3 positive sputum cultures, spanning >6 months). Those with persistent infection were matched 2:1 with age, sex, and time-period controls without history of E coli infection, and mixed-effects models were used to assess pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) frequency, lung function decline, hospitalization, and intravenous antibiotic days.Forty-five patients (12.3%) had E coli recovered from sputum samples between 1978 and 2016, and 1 patients (40%) developed persistent infection. Nine patients (24%) had PEx at incident infection, and increased bioburden was predictive of exacerbation (P = .03). Risk factors for persistent infection included lower nutritional status (P < .001) and lower lung function (P = .009), but chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was protective. There was no difference in annual lung function decline, need for hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics, or risk of PEx in patients with persistent infection.Persistent E coli infection was frequent and was more common in CF patients with low nutritional status and lung function. However, this does not predict clinical decline.

In pregnant long-haul travellers, little is known in terms of the absolute risk of VTE in these women and, therefore, there is limited consensus on appropriate thromboprophylaxis in this setting. Objective This review will provide guidance to allow practitioners to safely minimize the risk of travel-related VTE in pregnant women. The suggestions provided are based on limited data, extrapolated risk estimates of VTE in pregnant travellers and recommendations from published guidelines. Results We found that the absolute VTE risk per flight appears to be &amp;lt;1% for the average pregnant or postpartum traveller. In pregnant travellers with a prior history of VTE, a potent thrombophilia or strong antepartum risk factors (e.g. combination of obesity and immobility), the risk of VTE with travel appears to be &amp;gt;1%. Postpartum, the risk of VTE with travel may be &amp;gt;1% for women with thrombophilias (particularly in those with a family history) and other transient risk factors and in women with a prior VTE. Conclusions Based on our findings, we recommend simple measures be taken by all pregnant travellers, such as frequent ambulation, hydration and calf exercises. In those at an intermediate risk, we suggest a consideration of 20–30 mmHg compression stockings. In the highest risk group, we suggest careful consideration for low-molecular-weight heparin thromboprophylaxis.

Here siloxane-epoxy composite with good resistance to alternating heat and cold was obtained by a simple sol-gel preparation of 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES)-modified epoxy resin without using additional curing agent. The effect of the blend ratio of APTES on enhanced resistance to alternating heat and cold properties of composite material was investigated. Weight loss test by immersion in xylene and characterization by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed successful modification of epoxy resin. The char yield (about 2 %) at 60 °C of siloxane-epoxy composite containing 37.5 wt% APTES was higher than the reference epoxy sample (about 9.1 %), as identified by the thermogravimetric analysis. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the |Z|0.01 Hz value (2.58 × 10 Ω cm2) of 37.5 % modified epoxy resin-coated sample is much larger than that (4.13 × 10 cm2) of the reference epoxy coating, meaning the siloxane-epoxy composite provides effective corrosion protection. Moreover, it maintained the mechanical properties and protection ability after high (25 °C) and low temperature (−30 °C) alternation resistance test for 1 days.

However, it is unknown if this effect would be magnified with additional blood flow restriction via a cuff and what the influence on fatigue development would be. Twelve healthy male participants performed a 1-min IMVC of the knee extensors with and without additional blood flow occlusion induced by pneumatic cuff in counterbalanced order on separate days. Vastus lateralis muscle deoxygenation was estimated via near-infrared spectroscopy–derived tissue oxygen saturation (SmO 2 ) throughout the fatiguing contraction. Central and peripheral measures of neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) were assessed via surface electromyography (EMG) and force responses to voluntary contractions and peripheral nerve/transcranial magnetic stimulations before, immediately after, and throughout an 8-min recovery period. SmO 2 , force, and EMG amplitude decreased during the 1-min IMVC, but there were no between-condition differences. Similarly, no significant (p &gt; 0.05) between-condition differences were detected for any dependent variable immediately after the fatiguing contraction. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived voluntary activation was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the no-cuff condition during the recovery period. Sustained IMVC results in a similar degree of muscle deoxygenation and NMF as IMVCs with additional occlusion, providing further evidence that a sustained IMVC induces full ischemia. Novelty NMF etiology, muscle oxygenation, and corticospinal factors during an IMVC are similar with or without an occlusion cuff.

Although leucine-rich repeat-containing (LRRC) proteins have been identified as novel auxiliary γ-subunits of the BK channel (BKγ) in several cell types, its physiological roles in SMCs are unclear. The BK expression patterns in selected SM tissues were examined using real-time PCR analyses and Western blotting. The functional contribution of BKγ1 to BK channel activity was examined by whole cell patch-clamp in SMCs and heterologous expression systems. BKγ1 expression in mouse bronchial SMCs (mBSMCs) was higher than in other several SMC types. Coimmunoprecipitation and total internal reflection fluorescence imaging analyses revealed molecular interaction between BKα and BKγ1 in mBSMCs. Under voltage-clamp, steady-state activation of BK channel currents at pCa 8.0 in mBSMCs occurred in a voltage range comparable to that of reconstituted BKα/BKγ1 complex. However, this range was much more negative than in mouse aortic SMCs (mASMCs) or in HEK293 cells expressing BKα alone and β-subunit (BKβ1). Mallotoxin, a selective activator of BK channel that lacks BKγ1, dose-dependently activated BK currents in mASMCs but not in mBSMCs.

Eight randomized controlled trials have proven its efficacy and safety in patients with LVO presenting within 24 hours.1–3 EVT eligibility criteria are likely to expand even further into the ‘fringes’, as more and more data on the safety and efficacy of EVT beyond current guideline recommendations become available—for example, for patients with M occlusions4 and those presenting more than 24 hours from last known well.5 In fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a patient subgroup which does not benefit from EVT. While in the early days of EVT we were asking ourselves which patients to treat, the situation has now turned around; today, we ask ourselves which patients should not be treated.6 

Physicians pursue a more and more aggressive treatment strategy: patient age, time from symptom onset, comorbidities, distal occlusion site, low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score do not discourage us from offering EVT .7 As an example, current guideline recommendations from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association restrict level 1A treatment recommendations for EVT to patients with internal carotid artery and M occlusions, ASPECTS ≥6, and NIHSS score ≥6.8 However, in a recent international multidisciplinary survey with 60 physicians from 3 countries, most stated that they would offer EVT even in patients with further distal occlusions, and ASPECTS and NIHSS scores <6 (table 1).7

Displacement experiments are conducted on water-wet, fractured tight rock at in situ pressure and temperature of an oil reservoir via a specially designed apparatus to investigate the effects of fluid viscosity on the dynamic capillarity. The dynamic effect in the matrix is examined through the measurement and calculation of capillary pressure, the dynamic coefficient, and the fluid flow behavior. The results show that with a higher oil viscosity: (a) both the steady and the dynamic capillary pressures reverse their directions more quickly and behave as larger resistances in the matrix; (b) the difference between the steady and the dynamic capillary pressures becomes around 5%-19% more significant; (c) water saturation changes more slowly corresponding to the lower water relative permeability, while oil relative permeability quickly becomes lower than that during the basic displacement process; and (d) the dynamic coefficient becomes 2-3 times higher, and the dynamic contact angle becomes 10%-25% larger, showing a more variable interface.

Four numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the new scheme.

They might, for example, regulate the body’s momentum when stepping on stones to cross a stream. We examined what to do and how far to look, as a simple optimal control problem, where forward momentum is controlled to compensate for a step change in terrain height, and steady gait regained with no loss of time relative to nominal walking. We modeled planar, human-like walking with pendulum-like legs, and found the most economical control to be quite stereotypical. It starts by gaining momentum several footfalls ahead of an upward step, in anticipation of the momentum lost atop that step, and then ends with another speed-up to regain momentum thereafter. A similar pattern can be scaled to a variety of conditions, including both upward or downward steps, yet allow for considerably reduced overall energy and peak power demands, compared to compensation without anticipation. We define a “persistence time” metric from the transient decay response after a disturbance, to describe how momentum is retained between steps, and how far ahead a disturbance should be planned for.

Antifungal medications are commonly ineffective. This study aimed to investigate innate immune responses contributed by cathelicidins to P. bovis in the mammary gland using a mastitis model in mice deficient in the sole murine cathelicidin (Camp). We determined P. bovis caused acute mastitis in mice and induced Camp gene transcription. Whereas, Camp -/- and Camp +/+ littermates had similar local algae burden, Camp +/+ mice produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, and Cxcl-1. Likewise, Camp +/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages were more responsive to P. bovis, producing more TNF-α and Cxcl-1. Human cathelicidin (LL-37) exhibited a different effect against P. bovis; it had direct algicidal activity against P. bovis and lowered TNF-α, Cxcl-1, and IL-1β production in both cultured murine macrophages and mammary epithelial cells exposed to the pathogenic algae. In conclusion, cathelicidins were involved in protothecosis pathogenesis, with unique roles among the diverse peptide family.

The analysis of differentially expressed genes has elucidated areas of the genome involved in adaptive divergence to past and present environmental change. Such studies however have been hampered by large numbers of differentially expressed genes and limited knowledge of how these genes work in conjunction with each other. Recent methods (broadly termed ""pathway analyses"") have emerged that aim to group genes that behave in a coordinated fashion to a factor of interest. These methods aid in functional annotation and uncovering biological pathways, thereby collapsing complex datasets into more manageable units, providing more nuanced understandings of both the organism-level effects of modified gene expression, and the targets of adaptive divergence. Here, we reanalyze a dataset that investigated temperature-induced changes in gene expression in marine-adapted and freshwater-adapted threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with PANTHER Gene Ontology (GO)-Slim overrepresentation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Six modules exhibited a conserved response and six a divergent response between marine and freshwater stickleback when acclimated to 7°C or 22°C. One divergent module showed freshwater-specific response to temperature, and the remaining divergent modules showed differences in height of reaction norms. PPARAa, a transcription factor that regulates fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated in adaptive divergence, was located in a module that had higher expression at 7°C and in freshwater stickleback. This updated methodology revealed patterns that were not found in the original publication. Although such methods hold promise toward predicting population response to environmental stressors, many limitations remain, particularly with regard to module expression representation, database resources, and cross-database integration.",2020-03-03,Evolutionary Applications,https://openalex.org/V140378306,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12935,1166,1182,13,6,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005669612,https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12935,journal-article,3005669612

Typically, grief subsides without any major psychological or medical impairment. Nevertheless, some FMs may experience complicated grief (CG) reactions, with symptoms lasting months or years, and CG is particularly prominent among FMs of those who die in the intensive care unit (ICU). The purpose of this study was to examine how FMs experience grief, particularly CG, to inform future early screening and support programs in the ICU. This was a multicentre qualitative study focusing on semi-structured interviews with FMs who displayed symptoms of CG. Family members of patients who died in the ICU and who had a six-month inventory of CG score > 25 were included. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with FMs post-loss, with follow-up interviews three months after the initial interviews. Major themes identified following thematic analysis from eight participants with CG included 1) ante-mortem experience: the impact of the ICU experience prior to death of a loved on subsequent grief; 2) post-mortem experience: unpredictable post death reactions; 3) coping strategies: techniques used to reduce the severity of grief reactions; 4) sources of support: focusing on resources that the FM draws from for emotional support; and 5) perspectives on future ICU bereavement screening and support programs: advice that FM participants provided for future bereavement support.

However, the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress has yet to be carefully examined. This study had three goals: (1) examine the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress; (2) determine groups of men based on erectile function and sexual distress; and (3) examine the psychosexual characteristics of these groups. A cross section of 233 sexually active men after PCa treatment (age M = 64.90 years, SD = 7.50) completed an online survey containing demographic, health, and sexuality and relationship questionnaires. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress was curvilinear. Four groups of men were found: good erectile function and low sexual distress, poor erectile function and high sexual distress, but also good erectile function yet high sexual distress, and poor erectile function and low sexual distress. Regardless of erectile function, men with greater sexual distress were more depressed, reported additional sexual concerns, placed less value on sex, were less sexually satisfied, and used protective buffering communication more frequently. They were also less likely to be satisfied with their adaptation to sexual changes and less likely to have found a solution to those changes. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress is complex, characterized by a wide array of responses to erectile function (high and low distress) and multiple correlates of sexual distress.

Therefore, it seems that childhood obesity leads to partly irreversible decrements in cardiac function. Little is known about how obesity during maturation affects the mechanical properties of the heart. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contractile properties in developing hearts from animals with dietary-induced obesity (high-fat high-sucrose diet). We hypothesized that obesity induced during adolescence results in decrements in cardiac contractile function. Three-week-old rats (n = 16) were randomized into control (chow) or dietary-induced obesity (high-fat high-sucrose diet) groups. Following 14 weeks on the diet, skinned cardiac trabeculae fibre bundle testing was performed to evaluate active and passive force, maximum shortening velocity, and calcium sensitivity. Rats in the high-fat high-sucrose diet group had significantly larger body mass and total body fat percentage. There were no differences in maximal active or passive properties of hearts between groups. Hearts from the high-fat high-sucrose diet rats had significantly slower maximum shortening velocities and lower calcium sensitivity than controls. Decreased shortening velocity and calcium sensitivity in hearts of obese animals may constitute increased risk of cardiac disease in adulthood.

Additionally, little is known about how the experience of cancer might impact survivor siblings’ sleep. The current study compared the sleep of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were 2–7 years off therapy and their siblings to healthy control/sibling dyads. Methods Participants (survivors, n = 45; survivor siblings, n = 27; controls, n = 45; control siblings, n = 41; 58% male) aged 8–18 (m = 11.64) completed a 7-day sleep diary and seven consecutive days of actigraphy. Parents (n = 90) completed the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire for each of their children. Results No between-group differences were found on measures of sleep diaries or actigraphy. Parents reported that survivor siblings had significantly poorer sleep habits than survivors or controls. For survivors, greater time off treatment and younger age at diagnosis were associated with less total sleep time, more wake after sleep onset, and decreased sleep efficiency via actigraphy. Conclusion Sleep across all groups was consistent and below national guidelines. Although the survivor group did not have poorer sleep compared to their siblings or matched controls, within the survivor group, those who were diagnosed at an earlier age and those who were further off treatment had more disrupted sleep.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 10 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 1 patients with both CNS and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene’s metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20 th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20 th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser’s phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of UM data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs.",2020-07-02,npj Genomic Medicine,https://openalex.org/V2737523697,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41525-020-0132-5,,,5,1,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039768613,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41525-020-0132-5,journal-article,3039768613

Given their burden, we need to find efficacious ways to prevent these experiences. However, existing prevention programs tend to be single-issue and may not focus on the universal capacities required to reduce these problems among youth. To this end, we evaluated the universal, small groups Healthy Relationships Plus (HRP) program, which focuses on the promotion of positive mental health and the reduction of bullying and substance misuse. A sample of 212 youth from Southwestern Ontario were randomly assigned to the HRP or an attention-control condition over an 8-day period during summer 2014. Primary outcome measures (i.e., most important outcomes for this evaluation) were positive mental health, bullying victimization/perpetration, and substance misuse (alcohol, marijuana). We also examined a mediator (help-seeking) and two moderators (sex, adverse childhood experiences) of main effects. Participation in HRP was associated with reduced odds of physical bullying victimization at 1-year follow-up, compared with adolescents in the attention-control condition. This finding was mediated by increased intention to seek help from a mental health professional following HRP participation. We did not find main effects for positive mental health or substance misuse in this sample; however, there was an interaction effect whereby youth with significant trauma experiences reported less marijuana use at 1-year follow-up compared with control students.

The study objective was to determine which survey questions were most correlated with respondents' overall rating of care. Knowing which questions are most important may provide valuable insights for developing targeted quality improvement initiatives. Methods Within  weeks of discharge, 3,389 telephone surveys were completed by parents/guardians of children who were hospitalized for at least 2 hours. The survey was comprised of 6 questions, with responses based on Likert-scales. One survey question asked respondents to rate the overall care that their child received on a scale from  (worst care) to 1 (best care). The correlation between the overall rating of care and each survey measure and question was then examined using Spearman correlation coefficients. All survey questions were normalized to a 100-point score (0=worst, 100=best). Results Questions on provider coordination and nursing care were most correlated with overall experience. Quietness of hospital room (r=0.19, P<0.001), and keeping families informed in the emergency room (r=0.12, P<0.001) showed poor correlation.

SANCO is aligned with the ANC ruling party, and so Dunoon is a case of a CBO driving an alternative land tenure administration system using a form of private conveyancing operating in parallel and opposition to the official registration system for a period after first registration. Thus there was a party structure supporting a system running in opposition to the official system. The situation then evolved where the CBO encouraged registration as the risks to the buyer of off-register transactions became apparent when the official registration system emerged as the dominant land transaction option. Historical analysis and qualitative interviews inform the study. If hybrid governance is inescapable and if ownership titles meet beneficiaries’ needs and wants, then, ideally, state land administration organisations should engage households and community based organisations continually in title maintenance activities. To increase the uptake of registering land, changes to the rigid procedures required for registration should be explored to examine how certain arrangements and land tenure practices as they actually exist can be accommodated.",2020-01-01,Land Use Policy,https://openalex.org/V80485027,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104301,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982518865,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104301,journal-article,2982518865

In this work, investigation was conducted on the catastrophic pipeline leak, oil spill, and the resulting vapor cloud explosion accident occurring in China in 201 by modeling analysis, field surveys, and numerical simulations. The total amount of the spilled oil was up to 2044.4 m  due to improper disposal. The long residence time of the oil remaining in a confined space permitted the formation of explosive mixtures and caused the vapor cloud explosion. A numerical model was developed to estimate the consequence of the explosion based on volatilization testing results. The results show that the death-leading zone and the glass-breaking zone could be 1 m and 9 m, respectively, which are consistent with the field investigation. The severity of the explosion is related to the amount of the oil spill, properties of oil, and volatilization time. It is recommended that a comprehensive risk assessment be conducted to analyze the possible consequences upon oil spilling into a confined space. Prompt collection and ventilation measures should be taken immediately after the spill occurs to reduce the time for oil volatilization and prevent the mixture from reaching its explosive limit.",2020-04-01,Petroleum Science,https://openalex.org/V177501576,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-019-00403-2,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985003285,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12182-019-00403-2,journal-article,2985003285

Little research has been done to investigate interventions targeting the significant stress of caring for an adolescent with problematic substance use and its subsequent impact on self-compassion in families. The aim of this pilot study was to trial an 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program as a post treatment aftercare intervention among female caregivers of youth with substance use disorders. Forty-three female caregivers were recruited and randomly assigned to either a treatment (n = 21) or a waitlist control group (n = 22). Participants completed surveys pre/post-intervention to assess perceived stress and self-compassion. Qualitative interviews at post-intervention were designed to explore participants’ perceptions and experiences of the MBSR program. Five main themes captured the participants’ experience: improved self-compassion, increased capacity to manage stress, enhanced interpersonal effectiveness, improved overall physical wellness, and benefits of attending the program with women who have shared experience. Overall, this pilot MBSR program was found to significantly enhance the participants’ sense of well-being through reducing their perceived stress and increasing self-compassion.

Population-based epidemiological surveillance of sepsis is limited to basic data available in administrative databases. We sought to determine if routinely collected Census data, linked to hospitalization data, can provide a broad socio-demographic profile of patients admitted to Canadian hospitals with sepsis. Linking the 2006 long-form Canadian Census (most recent available for linkage) to the Discharge Abstract Data from 2006/2007 to 2008/2009, we created a population-based cohort of approximately 3,433,900 Canadians. Patients admitted to hospital with sepsis were identified using the Canadian Institute for Health Information administrative data definition. Age-standardized hospital admission rates for sepsis were calculated. Multivariable modelling was used to examine the relationship between Census characteristics and hospitalization with sepsis. Of those individuals successfully linked to the 2006 long-form Canadian Census, 10,400 patients of 1 yr and older were admitted to hospital with sepsis between the fiscal years 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. These individuals represented a weighted count of approximately 49,000 Canadians from all provinces and territories, excluding Quebec. The age-standardized rate of sepsis hospitalization was 9 cases/100,000 population. Of these, 37/100,000 cases were classified as severe sepsis. The association of Census characteristics with sepsis hospitalization varied with age. In all age-specific models, male sex, never being married, visible minority status, having functional limitations, and not being in the labour force were associated with an increased odds of hospital admission.

The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of pediatric epilepsy on the central nervous system, including gray matter volume, cerebral blood flow, and water diffusion, compared with neurologically normal children. Inter-ictal magnetic resonance imaging data was obtained from 3 children with epilepsy ages 1–16 (73% F, 27% M). An atlas-based approach was used to determine values for volume, cerebral blood flow, and apparent diffusion coefficient in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. These values were then compared with previously published values from 10 neurologically normal children using a MANCOVA analysis. Most brain volumes of children with epilepsy followed a pattern similar to typically developing children, except for significantly larger putamen and amygdala. Cerebral blood flow was also comparable between the groups, except for the putamen, which demonstrated decreased blood flow in children with epilepsy. Diffusion (apparent diffusion coefficient) showed a trend towards higher values in children with epilepsy, with significantly elevated diffusion within the thalamus in children with epilepsy compared with neurologically normal children. Children with epilepsy show statistically significant differences in volume, diffusion, and cerebral blood flow within their thalamus, putamen, and amygdala, suggesting that epilepsy is associated with structural changes of the central nervous system influencing brain development and potentially leading to poorer neurocognitive outcomes.",2020-03-01,Neuroradiology,https://openalex.org/V125989030,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-019-02332-8,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995468865,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-019-02332-8,journal-article,2995468865

Method A total of 3 women (18 with chronic pain and allodynia; 1 without pain) were recruited. Both groups were randomly assigned to receive  strokes of a benign stimulus on the abdomen at differing frequencies: 10, 30, or 10 seconds. Each group included  women. Pain was assessed using a rating scale of 1 to 10. Data were analyzed using the multivariate approach to repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The pattern of pain scores differed significantly between women with and without chronic pain (P = 0.002). Women with chronic pelvic pain and allodynia showed a statistically significant increase in pain with successive strokes of the cotton-tipped applicator (P = 0.012 for stroke 1 vs. 2, P = 0.02 for stroke  vs. 3, and P = 0.00 for stroke 1 vs. 3). Conclusion Women with chronic pelvic pain and allodynia showed significant worsening of pain with successive strokes of a cotton-tipped applicator.

Lizards (non-ophidian squamates) use their tongue to imbibe water, but for most lizards the tongue is also employed in other activities. To determine how these various demands can be accommodated alongside the tongue’s role in drinking, it is necessary to firstly determine the tongue’s function in water uptake and intraoral transport in a lizard that does not use this organ for chemoreception or food prehension. We selected the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) for this purpose. We build upon previous morphological observations of the anatomy of its tongue and oral cavity and explore its drinking behaviour through high-speed cinematography and cineradiography. This allows us to follow the movement of radio-opaquely labelled water in association with tongue, jaw and throat movements. The tongue is modified to collect water and to release it into the anterior region of the buccal cavity. Repeated tongue cycles are associated with the shifting of the imbibed water into paired ventrolateral chambers and ultimately to its passage to a single, midline posterior chamber prior to swallowing. Tongue movements, capillarity and pressure changes due to hyolingual movements cause water to be moved posteriorly along specific pathways prior to swallowing, bypassing the airways and dorsal surface of the mid- and hind tongue. In this licking-based lingually driven approach to drinking, only small volumes of water can be gathered at a time, with a drinking bout consisting of 20–30 tongue cycles before emersion and swallowing occur. This mechanism differs from drinking in turtles and snakes, which do not employ licking and may take in larger quantities of water. We advance the hypothesis that all lizards have conserved this pattern of tongue-based water uptake and precisely directed intraoral fluid transport, with specializations for tongue-based food capture and/or lingually based chemoreception being superimposed thereupon.",2020-05-01,Journal of Zoology,https://openalex.org/V44571845,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12763,33,44,311,1,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002975820,https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12763,journal-article,3002975820

This has allowed for extended research developments to attain a fundamental understanding of the fluid. This work reports novel high temperature modulus data over the λ-transition region for liquid elemental sulfur, measured through the use of a modified Anton-Paar Modular Compact Rheometer 302. From these measurements, further insight was gained on the viscoelastic behavior and reptative relaxation times for liquid elemental sulfur. The slow relaxation time, τs, related to reptative behavior, was found to be between 0.2 s and 0.2 s at 19 °C. Utilizing the Maxwell relation, this was determined to correspond to an estimated viscosity range from 7 000 × 10-3 Pa s to 9 000 × 10-3 Pa s, which is in agreement with previous viscosity studies on liquid sulfur. A Cole-Cole plot of the experimental data also displayed characteristics of Debye-like relaxation, suggesting that the slow relaxation process was related to local S-S bond scission and recombination in sulfur chains and was not a relaxation coinciding with a polymeric chain mode. Finally, consecutive heating and cooling of the sulfur sample gave replicate values up to 210 °C on the third heating cycle, where an apparent structural change took place possibly due to cycling over the secondary transition, producing a thermal history, or sulfur reactions with trace impurities.

We have examined the effects of PG545 on lymphocyte phenotypes and function. We report that PG545 treatment suppresses effector T cell activation and polarizes T cells away from Th17 and Th and toward Foxp3+ regulatory T cell subsets in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PG545 inhibits Erk1/2 signaling, a pathway known to affect both T cell activation and subset polarization. Interestingly, these effects are also observed in heparanase-deficient T cells, indicating that PG545 has effects that are independent of its role in heparanase inhibition. Consistent with these findings, administration of PG545 in a Th1/Th17-dependent mouse model of a delayed-type hypersensitivity led to reduced footpad inflammation, reduced Th17 memory cells, and an increase in FoxP3+ Treg proliferation. PG545 also promoted Foxp3+ Treg induction by human T cells. Finally, we examined the effects of other heparan sulfate mimetics PI-88 and PG5 on lymphocyte polarization and found that these likewise induced Foxp3+ Treg in vitro but did not reduce Th17 numbers or improve delayed-type hypersensitivity in this model. Together, these data indicate that PG545 is a potent inhibitor of Th1/Th17 effector functions and inducer of FoxP3+ Treg.

We evaluated an intervention bundle combining education and multilevel social comparison feedback to safely reduce repetitive use of inpatient routine laboratory tests. Methods This non-randomised controlled pre-intervention post-intervention study was conducted in four adult hospitals from October 201 to March 2018. In the medical teaching unit (MTU) of the intervention site, learners received education and aggregate social comparison feedback and attending internists received individual comparison feedback on routine laboratory test utilisation. MTUs of the remaining three sites served as control units. Number and cost of routine laboratory tests ordered per patient-day before and after the intervention was compared with the control units, adjusting for patient factors. Safety endpoints included number of critically abnormal laboratory test results, number of stat laboratory test orders, patient length of stay, transfer rate to the ICU, and 30-day readmission and mortality. Results A total of 1 00 patients were included. Pre-intervention and post-intervention groups were similar in age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of stay. From the pre-intervention period to the post-intervention period, significantly fewer routine laboratory tests were ordered at the intervention MTU (incidence rate ratio=0.89; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; p=0.048) with associated costs savings of $C68 87 (p=0.020) as compared with the control sites. The variability in the ordering pattern of internists at the intervention site also decreased post-intervention. No worsening was noted in the safety endpoints between the pre-intervention and post-intervention period at the intervention unit compared with the controls. Conclusions Combination of education and multilevel social comparison feedback significantly and safely led to cost savings through reduced use of routine laboratory tests in hospitalised patients.",2020-02-10,BMJ Quality & Safety,https://openalex.org/V152101599,BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010118,1.4,2,29,10,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005870364,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010118,journal-article,3005870364

Several cat studies around the world have shown variability in the prevalence of blood types in domestic and pedigree cats. Canadian data based on feline blood types is based out of Montreal. In this study the cohort of cats revealed a higher than anticipated prevalence; of 5% type B and 0.6% AB blood types. In our study, blood typing was performed in 40 domestic cats; 200 in Saskatoon and 200 in Calgary. Blood typing was performed using the gel tube method and the risk of transfusion mismatch (MT) was estimated by adding the risk of a major transfusion reaction and the risk of a minor transfusion reaction. The risk of neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) was estimated according to the equation (p2)(q2) + 2pq(q2), with q being the b allele frequency and p =  - q. There was an identical frequency for feline blood types in both Saskatoon and Calgary cats, with 96% type A, 4% type B, and 0% AB. Based on these percentages, the risks of MT and NI in domestic cats were 7.6 and  % respectively. The frequency of type B cats in the population was similar to that in the previous Canadian study.

This study evaluates the magnitude and potential clinical impact of the error related to partial volume effects in infarct volume measurement on diffusion-weighted MR imaging in acute stroke and explores how increasing spatial resolution could reduce this error. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted imaging of 39 patients with acute stroke, of whom 5 had anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion, was coregistered to standard space. Lesion boundaries were manually segmented. A 3D lesion-volume model was resampled for voxel sizes from 4 × 4 ×  to 1 ×  ×  mm, and the surface-volume, corresponding to the partial volume error, was calculated. The number of cases with anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion, in which the endovascular therapy core threshold of 70 mL was contained within the margin of error, was calculated as a function of imaging resolution. RESULTS: The mean infarct core volume was 27.2 ± 49.9 mL. The mean surface volume was 14.7 ± 20.8 mL for  ×  × 4 mm resolution and 7.4 ± 10.7 mL for  ×  ×  mm resolution. With a resolution of  ×  × 4 mm, 70 mL was contained within the margin of error in 7/56 cases (12.5%) with large-vessel occlusion, while with a  ×  ×  mm voxel size, the margin of error was 3/56 (5%). The lesion-volume range of potentially misclassified lesions dropped from 46.5–94.1 mL for a  ×  × 4 mm resolution to 64.4–80.1 mL for a  ×  × 2 mm resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Partial volume effect is an important source of error in infarct volume measurement in acute stroke. Increasing spatial resolution substantially decreases the mean error.

A numerical analysis referring to a long retaining wall is conducted using a two-dimensional discrete element model representing a granular system with a free top surface. On one of the lateral boundaries referring to the retaining wall, both active and passive loadings were applied monotonically as well as cyclically. First, the development of sheared zones and classic failure wedges resulting from active and passive monotonic displacements are discussed with respect to Rankine’s and Roscoe’s solution angles. Then, a series of loading cycles were performed using slow small-amplitude displacements at different stress states chosen before the occurrence of failure along the passive monotonic stress response curve. Particular interest is focused on the ultimate asymptotic cyclic response of the granular system, the occurrence of a high-mobility (convective) zone and a detailed macroscopic and microscopic analysis. Finally, major kinematical features that are displayed during cyclic loading from different starting stresses to eventually reach the same asymptotic state were elucidated through particle vortex-like flux formations, including contact rotations. The change in material stiffness was also investigated based on the evolution of strong and weak contact networks, together with the analysis of fabric anisotropy within the entire domain, including the high-mobility zone considered separately.",2020-03-01,Acta Geotechnica,https://openalex.org/V106535470,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11440-018-0733-7,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2896520265,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11440-018-0733-7,journal-article,2896520265

Wide dynamic range (WDR) means this ratio is so large that it exceeds the dynamic range of a traditional image sensor. Nowadays, WDR image sensors enable the capture of WDR scenes. However, the captured WDR image requires an additional tone mapping step to compress the high bit pixel of WDR image to low rate pixel so that it can be displayed on the screen. The tone mapping algorithm is mostly done in an image signal processor or with a specific software application. This brief proposes a tone mapping technique that is suitable for direct processing of the output of a WDR image sensor bitstream. The algorithm acquires statistics on the mantissa and exponent parts of the pixel value and then generates a refined histogram for tone mapping. Experiments that evaluate the image quality and hardware efficiency are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed mantissa exponent-based algorithm provides visually pleasing results and preserves details of the original WDR image better than other similar algorithms.

The calculation of reflection coefficients requires accurate knowledge of the survey geometry. To provide this, a Bayesian ray-based inversion is developed here that estimates source–receiver ranges, source depths, receiver depths, and water depths at reflection points along the track to much higher precision than prior information based on GPS and bathymetry measurements. Near the closest point of approach, where rays are near vertical, data information is low and inaccurate range estimates are improved using priors from analytic predictions based on nearby sections of the track.

Evidence was graded according to Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care and Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scales. A total of 1 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion from 102 articles initially identified. Only one study used the most recent 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. There was significant heterogeneity in the reporting of fibromyalgia populations. Outcomes reported were variable and not consistent across studies; thus, data could not be pooled. There appears to be a high prevalence of gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and gynaecological dysfunction. In case-control studies, these dysfunctions appeared to be more prevalent in the fibromyalgia group than in the control populations. However, this difference could not be quantified more specifically. In conclusion, the small number of eligible studies and the variety of pelvic floor outcomes reported limited formation of conclusive prevalence of pelvic floor disorders in the fibromyalgia population. From the small number of studied patients, there may be a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and gynaecological concerns in women with fibromyalgia.",2020-01-01,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada,https://openalex.org/V2755151586,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2019.02.013,72,79,42,1,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2956638243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2019.02.013,journal-article,2956638243

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of AKI after aSAH and to identify risk factors for renal dysfunction. Secondary objectives were to examine what effect AKI has on patient mortality and functional outcome at 12 weeks post-aSAH. METHODS The authors performed a post hoc analysis of the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial data set (clinical trial registration no.: NCT00111085, https://clinicaltrials.gov ). The primary outcome of interest was the development of AKI, which was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Secondary outcomes of interest were death and a modified Rankin Scale score greater than  at 12 weeks post-aSAH. Propensity score matching was used to assess for a significant treatment effect related to clazosentan administration and AKI. Univariate analysis, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) curves, and stepwise logistic regression models were used to evaluate for associations between baseline or disease-related characteristics and study outcomes. RESULTS One hundred fifty-six (38%) of the 41 patients enrolled in the CONSCIOUS-1 trial developed AKI during their ICU stay. A history of hypertension (p &lt; 0.001) and the number of nephrotoxic medications administered (p = 0.029) were independent predictors of AKI on multivariate analysis. AKI was an independent predictor of death (p = 0.028) but not a poor functional outcome (p = 0.21) on multivariate testing. Unresolved renal dysfunction was the strongest independent predictor of death in this cohort (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AKI is a common complication following aSAH. Patients with premorbid hypertension and those treated with nephrotoxic medications may be at greater risk for renal dysfunction. AKI appears to confer an increased probability of death after aSAH.",2020-09-01,Journal of Neurosurgery,https://openalex.org/V1995308,Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group,https://doi.org/10.3171/2019.4.jns19103,765,772,133,3,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2958565858,https://doi.org/10.3171/2019.4.jns19103,journal-article,2958565858

HBV within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has been reported in association with intrauterine HBV infection. We analyzed HBV replication status in PBMC and PC/BCP mutants in PBMC from pregnant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.MethodsPregnant CHB carriers were assessed for HBeAg, HBV-DNA, ALT in second–third trimester and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) postpartum. HBV-DNA, HBV-cccDNA, and HBV-mRNA were tested in PBMC by in-house PCR. BCP/PC variants were determined by Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA7.ResultsIn 3 CHB pregnant carriers, median age 3 years, 53% Asian, median ALT 1 versus 2 U/L, median HBV-DNA 2.6 versus 8.1 logIU/mL (untreated vs. treated), eight HBeAg+, with genotype 10%A, 29%B, 21%C, 10%D, 19%E, eight received tenofovir in pregnancy to reduce vertical transmission risk. HBV-DNA was detected in ~ 55% (25/45) PBMC, and PC/BCP mutations were found in 36% (9/25) and 4% (1/25), respectively.

By injecting polymer into a reservoir, the viscosity of water is increased, and the efficiency of water flooding is improved. As a result, more oil can be recovered. This paper presents numerical simulations of a polymer flooding process using parallel computers, where the numerical modeling of polymer retention, inaccessible pore volumes, a permeability reduction and polymer absorption are considered. Darcy's law is employed to model the behavior of a fluid in porous media, and the upstream finite difference (volume) method is applied to discretize the mass conservation equations. Numerical methods, including discretization schemes, linear solver methods, nonlinearization methods and parallel techniques are introduced. Numerical experiments show that, on one hand, computed results match those from the commercial simulator, Eclipse, Schlumberger, which is widely applied by the petroleum industry, and, on the other hand, our simulator has excellent speedup, which is demonstrated by large-scale applications with up to 2 million grid blocks using up to 204 CPU cores.",2020-01-01,Journal of Computational Physics,https://openalex.org/V148709879,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.108995,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978763659,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.108995,journal-article,2978763659

This vesicular zinc can then be released in an activity-dependent fashion as an intercellular signal. The functions of vesicular zinc are not entirely understood, but evidence suggests that it is important for some forms of experience-dependent plasticity in the brain. The ability of neurons to store and release vesicular zinc is dependent on expression of the vesicular zinc transporter, ZnT3. Here, we examined the neuronal morphology of mice that lack ZnT3. Brains were collected from mice housed under standard laboratory conditions and from mice housed in enriched environments - large, multilevel enclosures with running wheels, numerous objects and tunnels, and a greater number of cage mates. Golgi-Cox staining was used to visualize neurons for analysis of dendritic length and dendritic spine density. Neurons were analyzed from the barrel cortex, striatum, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus (CA1). ZnT3 knockout mice, relative to wild type mice, exhibited increased basal dendritic length in the layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex, independently of housing condition. Environmental enrichment decreased apical dendritic length in these same neurons and increased dendritic spine density on striatal medium spiny neurons. Elimination of ZnT3 did not modulate any of the effects of enrichment. Our results provide no evidence that vesicular zinc is required for the experience-dependent changes that occur in response to environmental enrichment. They are consistent, however, with recent reports suggesting increased cortical volume in ZnT3 knockout mice.",2020-02-03,Behavioural Brain Research,https://openalex.org/V81474683,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112336,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982997872,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112336,journal-article,2982997872

Small- and intermediate-conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa2.3 and KCa3.1, respectively) are prominently expressed in the vascular endothelium, and pharmacological activators of these channels induce robust vasodilation upon acute exposure in isolated arteries and intact animals. However, the effects of prolonged in vivo administration of such compounds are unknown. In our study, we hypothesized that such treatment would ameliorate aging-related cardiovascular deficits. Aged (∼1 months) male Sprague Dawley rats were treated daily with either vehicle or the KCa channel activator SKA-31 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection; n = 6/group) for 8 weeks, followed by echocardiography, arterial pressure myography, immune cell and plasma cytokine characterization, and tissue histology. Our results show that SKA-31 administration improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation, reduced agonist-induced vascular contractility, and prevented the aging-associated declines in cardiac ejection fraction, stroke volume and fractional shortening, and further improved the expression of endothelial KCa channels and associated cell signalling components to levels similar to those observed in young male rats (∼ months at end of study). SKA-31 administration did not promote pro-inflammatory changes in either T cell populations or plasma cytokines/chemokines, and we observed no overt tissue histopathology in heart, kidney, aorta, brain, liver and spleen. SKA-31 treatment in young rats had little to no effect on vascular reactivity, select protein expression, tissue histology, plasma cytokines/chemokines or immune cell properties.

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from two blinded cluster randomized control trials of influenza vaccines in Hutterite colonies. In trial 1, children received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or hepatitis A vaccine. In trial 2, children received trivalent live attenuated (TLAIV) or TIV. We assessed four outcomes (total number of symptoms, number of respiratory symptoms, number of systemic symptoms, and duration of symptoms) among children with PCR-confirmed influenza. We utilized two-sample t tests to quantify the relationship between vaccine group and outcome. We performed multivariable strain-specific analyses, controlling for age and season. RESULTS TIV vs. Hep A vaccine: Among vaccinated children, 20 confirmed influenza infections were observed across 301 person-seasons. Vaccine type (TIV vs. Hep A vaccine) did not significantly affect the number of respiratory or systemic symptoms, nor duration of symptoms (P > .05). TLAIV vs. TIV: Among 118 children who received a study vaccine, 16 confirmed influenza infections were observed. TLAIV recipients experienced fewer total, respiratory, and systemic symptoms compared to TIV recipients (P < .05 for all). TLAIV-associated attenuation of symptom severity was observed in influenza B or A/H1N1 infections, but not H3.

Similarly, ghrelin, a gut-secreted hormone, is also associated with weight gain, adiposity, and increased feeding. Here we sought to determine if corticosterone-induced metabolic and behavioral changes require functional ghrelin receptors (GHSR). To do this, we treated male C57BL mice with chronic corticosterone (CORT) mixed in their drinking water for 28 days. Half of these mice received the GHSR antagonist JMV2959 via osmotic minipumps while treated with CORT. In a second experiment, we gave the same CORT protocol to mice with a targeted mutation to the GHSR or their wild-type littermates. As expected, CORT treatment increased food intake, weight gain, and adiposity, but contrary to expectations, mice treated with a GHSR receptor antagonist or GHSR knockout (KO) mice did not show attenuated food intake, weight gain, or adiposity in response to CORT. Similarly, the effects of CORT on the liver were the same or more pronounced in GHSR antagonist-treated and GHSR KO mice. Treatment with JMV2959 did attenuate the effects of chronic CORT on glycemic regulation as determined by the glucose tolerance test. Finally, disruption of GHSR signaling resulted in behavioral responses associated with social withdrawal, potentially due to neuroprotective effects of GHSR activation. In all, we propose that blocking GHSR signaling helps to moderate glucose concentrations when CORT levels are high, but blocking GHSR signaling does not prevent increased food intake, weight gain, or increased adiposity produced by chronic CORT.",2020-03-01,Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V157527038,The Endocrine Society,https://doi.org/10.1210/endocr/bqz023,,,161,3,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989838574,https://doi.org/10.1210/endocr/bqz023,journal-article,2989838574

Isolated gastrointestinal neurofibromas have not been associated with Lynch syndrome (LS). Patients with LS are at an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and are recommended to undergo screening colonoscopy.A 33-year-old healthy female with a family history of LS was found to have unresectable polyp in the ascending colon on screening colonoscopy suspicious for malignancy. The patient was asymptomatic and had no stigmata of neurofibromatosis. A staging workup for colorectal cancer revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. A discussion with the patient resulted in the decision to undergo a segmental resection with ongoing surveillance. The patient underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.

The rise of resistance to these drugs, mediated by enzymatic modification, has since compromised their utility as a treatment option, prompting intensive research into the molecular function of resistance enzymes. Here, we report the crystal structure of aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ANT(4')-IIb in apo and tobramycin-bound forms at a resolution of 1.6 and 2.15 A, respectively. ANT(4')-IIb was discovered in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and conferred resistance to amikacin and tobramycin. Analysis of the ANT(4')-IIb structures revealed a two-domain organization featuring a mixed β-sheet and an α-helical bundle. ANT(4')-IIb monomers form a dimer required for its enzymatic activity, as coordination of the aminoglycoside substrate relies on residues contributed by both monomers. Despite harbouring appreciable primary sequence diversity compared to previously characterized homologues, the ANT(4')-IIb structure demonstrates a surprising level of structural conservation highlighting the high plasticity of this general protein fold. Site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues and kinetic analysis provides support for a catalytic mechanism similar to those of other nucleotidyltransferases. Using the molecular insights provided into this ANT(4')-IIb-represented enzymatic group, we provide a hypothesis for the potential evolutionary origin of these aminoglycoside resistance determinants.",2020-01-29,Protein Science,https://openalex.org/V156919612,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3815,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998443902,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3815,journal-article,2998443902

Dialogic theory predicts that medical school discourses influence the positions students incorporate into their professional identities. As this may affect how students later exercise power in doctor-patient relationships, we set out to examine how medical teachers position doctors in relation to patients. Methods Informed by Holland's Figured Worlds theory, which draws important assumptions from Bakhtin, we chose dialogic research methodology to examine how educators' language positions doctors and may influence students' identity formation. We recruited a maximum variation sample of 10 teaching staff and used open prompts in individual semi-structured interviews to elicit discourses of doctors' social position. We used Sullivan's dialogic methodology reflexively to identify informative speech acts (utterances) and to examine how the language used in these constructed doctors' positions. Results Dominant discourses of Social Superiority, Technical Effectiveness, and Benevolence elevated doctors' positions based on their social status, applied knowledge and trustworthiness, respectively. These positions were defended by predicating medical care on doctors' mastery of treatments and their superior knowledge. A non-dominant discourse of Distributed Power and Responsibility narrowed the positional gap by constructing doctors as empowering patients. Conclusions Whereas three conservative discourses upheld doctors' elevated social position, a non-dominant, transformative discourse distributed power. We suggest that doctors will form the best relationships with patients when they are aware of these discourses and know how to navigate them. In pursuit of effective and compassionate patient care, we commend critical pedagogy as a means of articulating non-dominant discourses and increasing students', educators' and doctors' awareness of how they learn the positions of doctors.",2020-01-28,Medical Education,https://openalex.org/V54816476,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14074,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001088662,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14074,journal-article,3001088662

All samples in each case history were derived from the same source rock systems and have a similar maturity level. The variations in molecular compositions are merely caused by variable levels of biodegradation. GC–MS analysis results based on overall saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon distributions illustrated that biodegradation influences on Athabasca oil sands were less severe than these in Liaohe oil sands and Bongor oils but biodegradation level assignment is inconclusive and confusion. Novel biodegradation parameters based on methylchrysene (MCh) isomer distributions and relative abundance between alkylchrysenes and alkylphenanthrenes were proposed to differentiate biodegradation influence at heavy to severe biodegradation levels. The 3-MCh is proved to be the most stable methylchrysene isomer and the ratio of 3-MCh/∑MCh can serve as a novel biodegradation parameter. Meanwhile, alkylchrysenes show much higher ability to resist biodegradation than alkylphenanthrenes and the ratio of C0-1Ch/C2P was proposed as another novel biodegradation parameter. While the nature of organic source input may exert some impacts on the initial values of these novel parameters, continuous increases in these two parameters with intensified biodegradation levels may provide a supplemental tool for biodegradation influence assessment especially when biodegradation approaches to severe levels.",2020-05-15,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117366,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006534613,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117366,journal-article,3006534613

Family caregivers of critically ill patients can be partners in the early recognition, prevention and management of delirium provided they are aware of the signs/symptoms and appropriate non-pharmacological strategies that might be taken. Valid, reliable instruments that assess family caregiver knowledge are essential so that nurses can prepare family caregivers to be effective partners. The purpose of the current study was to (a) adapt an existing caregiver delirium knowledge questionnaire (CDKQ) for use by nurses to measure a family caregiver’s delirium knowledge in the ICU; and (b) examine the psychometric properties and structure of the adapted Caregiver ICU Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire (CIDKQ). Methods In this cross-sectional study, a multidisciplinary team developed the 21-item CIDKQ (possible score range: 0–21) and administered it to 15 family caregivers of critically ill patients. Descriptive statistics were examined for all variables. The CIDKQ was analyzed for face validity, content validity, reliability and internal consistency. Results The mean CIDKQ score was 14.1 (SD: 3.5, range =  to 21). Path analysis revealed that a family caregiver’s delirium knowledge in the actions and symptoms dimensions had a direct effect on knowledge of delirium risk factors.

An internet survey was administered to Canadian dairy producers between March and April 201 to collect information on current management practices. Approximately 81% (867/1,076) and 63% (673/1,065) of respondents reported that at least one animal died unassisted and at least one animal was euthanized on the farm in the preceding 12-mo period, respectively. Overall, mean mortality was 8% for cows, and  and 2% for preweaning and weaned heifers, respectively. On average, 48, 76, and 89% of all reported mortality events in cows, weaned heifers, and preweaning heifers were recorded as unassisted deaths. Cows that died without assistance were necropsied more often than preweaning heifers dying without assistance; these cows were also necropsied more than cows that were euthanized. Conversely, preweaning heifers that were euthanized were necropsied more frequently than those that died without assistance. Choosing not to perform necropsies on animals that die of unknown causes could represent a missed opportunity to identify cause of death and inform changes to prevent future deaths. The use of a firearm was the most common method for euthanizing cows and heifers (54%) and male dairy calves (51%). Approximately 7% of respondents reported using blunt force to euthanize animals. The use of this method was much higher for euthanasia of male dairy calves (34%) than for heifer calves (7%). Quebec respondents euthanized their animals using blunt force more often than farmers from other regions. Further, 53% of respondents using blunt force indicated it was their primary method of calf euthanasia; these results are extremely concerning. Approximately 31% of respondents who reported that they do not use blunt force to euthanize heifers and cows did report using blunt force to euthanize male dairy calves.

Surveys have shown that healthcare professionals (HCPs) do not always communicate with them well, leaving children and adolescents under-involved and unsure who to ask when concerned. Recent qualitative studies have recognised that HCPs have a major influence on children’s and adolescents’ experiences, where poorer interactions can lead to fear, missed appointments and potentially a worse clinical outcome. Little is known about how children and adolescents experience the HCPs who play such an integral role in their healthcare. This review aims to explore children’s and adolescents’ lived experience of HCPs, so that a deeper understanding of the interactions between them can equip HCPs to provide care that better aligns with patients’ needs. Method This study will use scoping review methodology to map the existing published literature comprehensively and systematically, following a six-step framework.

The objective of this scoping review was to systematically examine the literature describing public involvement in initatives to reduce low-value care. Methods Evidence sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from inception to November 26, 2019, grey literature (CADTH Tool), reference lists of included articles, and expert consultation. Citations were screened in duplicate and included if they referred to the public’s perception and/or involvement in reducing low-value care. Public included patients or citizens without any advanced healthcare knowledge. Low-value care included medical tests or treatments that lack efficacy, have risks that exceed benefit, or are not cost-effective. Extracted data pertained to study characteristics, low-value practice, clinical setting, and level of public involvement (i.e., patient-clinician interaction, research, or policy-making). Results The 21 included citations were predominantly original research ( n = 138, 63%), published since 201 ( n = 192, 88%), originating from North America ( n = 146, 67%). Most citations focused on patient engagement within the patient-clinician interaction ( n = 156, 72%), using tools that included shared decision-making ( n = 66, 42%) and patient-targeted educational materials ( n = 72, 46%), and reported both reductions in low-value care and improved patient perceptions regarding low-value care. Fewer citations examined public involvement in low-value care policy-making ( n = 33, 15%). Among citations that examined perspectives regarding public involvement in initiatives to reduce low-value care ( n = 10, 5%), there was consistent support for the utility of tools applied within the patient-clinician interaction and less consistent support for involvement in policy-making. Conclusions Efforts examining public involvement in low-value care concentrate within the patient-clinician interaction, wherein patient-oriented educational materials and shared decision-making tools have been commonly studied and are associated with reductions in low-value care. This contrasts with inclusion of the public in low-value care policy decisions wherein tools to promote engagement are less well-developed and involvement not consistently viewed as valuable.

However, recent reports surprisingly find that a substantial subset of children interpret disjunction as conjunction, concluding instead that the girl must have both fruits. According to these studies, children arrive at conjunctive readings not because they have a non-adult-like semantics, but because they lack access to the stronger scalar alternative and, and employ doubly exhaustified disjuncts when computing implicatures. Using stimuli modelled on previous studies, we test English-speaking preschoolers and replicate the finding that many children interpret or conjunctively. However, we speculate that conditions which replicate this finding may be pragmatically infelicitous, such that results do not offer a valid test of children’s semantic competence. We show that when disjunctive statements are uttered in contexts that render the speaker’s intended question more transparent, conjunctive readings disappear almost entirely.",2020-05-07,Journal of Semantics,https://openalex.org/V146447972,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffz022,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2900630539,https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffz022,journal-article,2900630539

Scientific and technological advancements impact the occupational landscape of humans. This scoping review aimed to ascertain the academic engagement with occupation in relation to robotics and human enhancement focusing in particular on how people with disabilities and rehabilitation were mentioned.Method: SCOPUS and the 70 databases of EBSCO host were searched. Manifest and latent content coding and thematic grouping of codes relevant to answering the review questions was performed.Results: Only four articles engaged with occupation in relation to human enhancement. As to occupation and robotics, some occupational fields were visible and not others; occupational health and safety was the most visible one; people with disabilities were covered from a medical, therapeutic angle and not in relation to social issues caused by the occupational impact of robotics. Change in the scope, meaning, and clients of rehabilitation efforts related to occupation enabled by human enhancement and robotics was not covered.Conclusions: The gaps found should be filled. The impact of robotics and human enhancement on the occupational landscape indicates the need for rehabilitation to think beyond recovery to the species typical as a goal. The ultrabilitation concept could help to meet this need.Implications for rehabilitationAdvances in robotics and human enhancement beyond species-typical levels modify the occupational landscape, human ability expectations in this setting, and the meaning and scope of disability and rehabilitation (clinical and community based).There is a need to elucidate the impact of these changes on the meaning, scope and goals of recovery-oriented rehabilitation.The recently coined term ""ultrabilitation"" creates space to discuss an ability expectation creep triggered by developments in robotics and human enhancement, particularly within occupation focused rehabilitation.",2020-05-21,Disability and Rehabilitation,https://openalex.org/V12843020,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1527401,1518,1528,42,11,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2913821420,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1527401,journal-article,2913821420

However, substantial interobserver variability impairs outcome assessment as well as reduces power of clinical trials. Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchical assessment tool (miFUNCTION) to address the shortcomings of the modified Rankin Scale and deliver a more thorough understanding of disability following stroke. Methods: The initial construct validity of miFUNCTION was established in a pilot study of patients at an outpatient stroke prevention clinic that had been diagnosed with stroke within 60 days. To further assess criterion validity, miFUNCTION was compared against the modified Rankin Scale and other outcome measures within the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial. Logistic regression analysis with miFUNCTION as an outcome was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment. Results: The pilot study showed moderate inter-observer agreement (k = 0.585, p < 0.005) but near perfect correlation between miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale (ρ = 0.821, p < 0.05). The correlation of miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale was near perfect again in the ESCAPE trial (ρ = 0.944). Effect size of the multivariable models using modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio: 3.45, 95% confidence interval: 2.05–5.78) and miFUNCTION (adjusted odds ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.99–5.55) as an outcome measure for the ESCAPE trial patients was similar. Conclusions: miFUNCTION is strongly associated with the degree of disability following stroke both in an outpatient setting and a clinical trial.

Because research to this date has mostly focused on the impact of PCa on erectile function, very little is known about the impact of PCa on other relevant sexual outcomes, such as sexual satisfaction. Aim To conduct a literature review of studies that have examined sexual satisfaction in men diagnosed with and treated for PCa. Methods A systematic review was conducted using Scopus and PubMed databases to identify studies that had assessed sexual satisfaction in men with PCa. The main characteristics of each study and results regarding the impact of PCa on sexual satisfaction were extracted and examined. Main Outcome Measure The main outcome measure was studies that assessed general sexual satisfaction in men with PCa. Results Thirty-eight articles were found regarding sexual satisfaction in PCa. Most studies did not focus on sexual satisfaction specifically, and methodologic limitations produced very mixed results. Overall, PCa treatments had a low to moderate impact on sexual satisfaction, and psychosocial interventions were more successful at improving sexual satisfaction than medical interventions. Sexual satisfaction was correlated to a large number of sexual, relational, psychological, and medical variables. Conclusion This literature review shows very mixed results about the sexual satisfaction in men with PCa. Differences in research designs, methodologic limitations, and studies conducted atheoretically limit our understanding of the mechanisms that impact sexual satisfaction in men with PCa. We propose an alternative way of conducting research on sexual satisfaction by using solid theoretical models of sexual satisfaction. Santos-Iglesias P, Rana M, Walker L.

However, most studies examining the short- and long-term consequences of birth on child health only consider gestational age at delivery, not the underlying cause. OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of both gestational age at delivery and underlying cause of delivery on child health outcomes. METHODS This population-based retrospective cohort study of singleton infants born in Alberta (April 2004-March 2005) used linked administrative and perinatal data to identify birth subtypes by underlying cause (infection/inflammation (I/I), placental dysfunction (PD), both, or neither), gestational age at delivery, and child health outcomes (neonatal morbidity and mortality, paediatric complex chronic conditions, and neurodevelopmental disorders and disabilities). Poisson regression with robust variance was used to assess differences in the (adjusted) risk ratio (RR) of each outcome by gestational age, and by cause of delivery. The roles of gestational age and cause of delivery were examined using mediation analysis methods. RESULTS A total of 38,192 children were included, with 66.7% experiencing neither I/I nor PD (I/I: 4.0%, PD: 27.5%, both: 1.8%). Infants born preterm had higher risk of all outcomes compared to those born at term and late-term. Infants with exposure to both causes had higher risk of all outcomes (neonatal morbidity, RR 8.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.55, 10.63; paediatric complex chronic conditions, RR 3.94, 95% CI 3.08, 5.05; and neurodevelopmental disorders, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.37, 1.84). The effect of underlying cause of delivery on child health outcomes was partially explained by gestational age, more in cases involving I/I than in those involving PD alone. CONCLUSIONS Short- and long-term child health outcomes differ by the underlying cause leading to delivery, as well as the gestational age at delivery.

However, the description method based on conventional data monitoring is a way to solve this problem. The experimental results of dry combustion indicates that the position of combustion front has a nearly linear correlation with the total acid numbers (TAN) of oil produced for in-situ combustion (ISC). Meanwhile, the tendency of pressure variation between neighboring air injection wells can determine the state and the time of combustion chamber connected in linear ISC process. Therefore, based on the relationship between TAN, injection pressure and combustion front, the acid numbers-pressure(ANP) method is established，which is suitable for dry linear fire flooding. Further, this method is applied to the calculation of the position of the combustion front in HQ1 ISC pilot area in Xinjiang over the years. Compared with other methods, the ANP method can rapidly calculate the position of combustion front and confirm the connectivity of combustion chamber. In addition, the combination of the ANP and other method is a good solution to confirm the position of combustion front for dry linear ISC process.",2020-04-01,International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer,https://openalex.org/V118246204,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2020.104530,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007683346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2020.104530,journal-article,3007683346

This has caused major challenges regarding the organization of systems of care, which have to meet the increasing demand for thrombectomies. This study aims to evaluate how endovascular therapy decisions made by European and North American physicians under their current local resources differ from those made under assumed ideal conditions. Methods In an international, multidisciplinary survey, physicians involved in acute stroke care were asked to give their treatment decisions to 1 out of 2 randomly assigned stroke case-scenarios. Participants stated (a) their treatment approach under assumed ideal conditions (without any external limitations) and (b) the treatment they would pursue under their current local resources. Resources gaps (ideal minus current endovascular therapy rates) were calculated for different countries/states/provinces and correlated to economic and healthcare key metrics (gross domestic product-per-capita, public or private health insurance coverage, etc.). Results A total of 60 physicians, among them 21 from North America and 13 from 2 European countries, responded to the survey. Resources gaps in the majority of North American states/provinces and European countries were small (&lt;5%).

Few existing capillary pressure obtainment methods are capable of providing accurate in-situ capillary pressures for tight formations. This work has developed and verified a method (SMD) to measure the in-situ capillary pressure specially for tight formations under high pressure, high temperature and confining pressure with native formation fluids. The capillary pressures converted from the porous plate method (PP), the mercury intrusion method (MICP) and the self-developed method under ambient temperature (SDM-A) were compared with the in-situ capillary pressures to examine errors of the converted capillary pressures. Furthermore, the in-situ capillary pressures and the pore structure of a target tight formation were investigated through the SDM. Results show that the relative errors of the SDM are lower than 20% with an average value of 7.8%. Average relative errors are around 29.5%, 12% and 6% for the converted capillary pressures from the MICP, PP and SDM-A, respectively. This indicates that it is better to measure the in-situ capillary pressure directly through the easy and reliable SDM than to convert from other capillary pressures. The median in-situ capillary pressures of the target tight rock samples range from 0.1 MPa to 0. MPa. The pore throat radiuses are mainly from 0.1 μm to 1.0 μm, and the movable oil saturation is between 11.72% and 66.21% with an average value of 34.92%.

Clear somatic genetic drivers are difficult to identify in the majority of cases. We hypothesized that this may be due to the existence of germline variants that influence tumor etiology and/or progression and are filtered out using traditional pipelines for somatic mutation calling. Methods In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets of matched germlines and tumor tissues to identify recurrent germline variants in pHGG patients. Results We identified two structural variants that were highly recurrent in a discovery cohort of  pHGG patients. One was a ~ 4 kb deletion immediately upstream of the NEGR1 locus and predicted to remove the promoter region of this gene. This copy number variant (CNV) was present in all patients in our discovery cohort ( n = 8) and in 86.3% of patients in our validation cohort ( n = 7 cases). We also identified a second recurrent deletion 55.7 kb in size affecting the BTNL and BTNL loci. This BTNL3–8 deletion was observed in 62.5% patients in our discovery cohort, and in 17.8% of the patients in the validation cohort. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data showed that both deletions result in disruption of transcription of the affected genes. However, analysis of genomic information from multiple non-cancer cohorts showed that both the NEGR1 promoter deletion and the BTNL3–8 deletion were CNVs occurring at high frequencies in the general population. Intriguingly, the upstream NEGR1 CNV deletion was homozygous in ~ 40% of individuals in the non-cancer population. This finding was immediately relevant because the affected genes have important physiological functions, and our analyses showed that NEGR1 expression levels have prognostic value for pHGG patient survival. We also found that these deletions occurred at different frequencies among different ethnic groups.

While studies have investigated metacognition in schizophrenia and clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), less is known about the potential mechanisms which result in metacognitive deficits.Aims:We aimed to investigate whether neurocognitive functions including attention, working memory, verbal learning and executive functions predicted the tendency to focus on one’s thoughts (cognitive self-consciousness) and beliefs in the efficacy of one’s cognitive skills (cognitive confidence).Method:Participants (130 CHR individuals) were recruited as part of the multi-site PREDICT study. They were assessed using the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ) as well as measures of executive function (WCST), attention (N-Back), working memory (LNS) and verbal learning (AVLT).Results:Cognitive competence was negatively correlated with N-Back while cognitive self-consciousness was positively correlated with N-Back and LNS. Linear regression analysis with N-Back, AVLT, LNS and WCST as predictors showed that neurocognition significantly predicted cognitive self-consciousness, with N-Back, LNS and WCST as significant predictors. The model accounted for 14% of the variance in cognitive self-consciousness. However, neurocognition did not result in a significant predictive model of cognitive competence.Conclusions:Neurocognition was associated with an increased focus on one’s thoughts, but it was not associated with higher confidence in one’s cognitive skills. Neurocognition accounted for less than one-sixth of the variance in metacognition, suggesting that interventions that target neurocognition are unlikely to improve metacognitive abilities.",2020-03-01,Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy,https://openalex.org/V143899192,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352465819000328,248,252,48,2,,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2939059694,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352465819000328,journal-article,2939059694

GE was calculated conventionally in the last  min of submaximal (50%MAP) cycling bouts performed before and after HIE (Pre50%MAP and Post 50%MAP). To calculate GE using BE (BGE), a linear regression of GE submaximal values post-HIE were back extrapolated to the end of the HIE bout.BGE was significantly correlated with Post50%MAP GE in P1 (r= 0.64; P = 0.01), and in P2 (r = 0.85; P = 0.002). Reliability data for P1 and P2 BGE demonstrate a mean CV of 7.8% and 9.8% with limits of agreement of 4.3% and 4.5% in relative GE units respectively. P2 BGE was significantly lower than P2 Post50%MAP GE (18.1 ± 1.6% vs 20.3 ± 1.7%; P= 0.01). Using a declining GE from the BE method, there was a 44% greater anaerobic contribution compared to assuming a constant GE during  min HIE at 100%MAP.HIE acutely reduced BGE at 100%MAP.

Plus de la moitie des participants etaient en situation d'itinerance continue depuis plus de dix ans. Les personnes plus âgees ont fait etat de problemes de sante complexes et d'obstacles importants pour l'acces aux soins de sante, associes notamment a leurs problemes financiers, aux listes d'attente et au fait de ne pas recevoir d'aide malgre leurs demandes. Les repondants plus âges ont rapporte des taux de traumatismes durant l'enfance inferieurs a ceux des repondants plus jeunes, bien que la moyenne de ces taux soit 2,5 fois superieure a celle de la population generale. La reconnaissance des effets croises et cumulatifs de l'itinerance de long terme et de l'âge pourrait guider la modification des politiques visant a reduire les cloisonnements entre les services publics.

This article aims to evaluate and assess the health issues of Calgarians over the age of 50 who are experiencing chronic homelessness, determine their unmet service needs, and assess whether there are predictors of chronic homelessness (such as childhood trauma) that could be addressed with changes to policy or service delivery. Three hundred participants were recruited from emergency shelters, as well as a from a small group of rough sleepers in Calgary, Canada in the winter of 2016. Excel and SPSS were used for analysis beginning with descriptive statistics for the samples of respondents who are 50 and older (n = 142) and under the age of 50 (n = 158). More than half of participants had been homeless continually for more than 1 years. Older adults reported complex health issues and significant barriers to accessing health care including finances, wait lists, and asking for help but not receiving it. Older adults reported lower rates of childhood trauma than their younger counterparts, yet the average was two and half times that of the general population. Recognition of the intersecting and cumulative effects of long-term homelessness and age could inform changes to policy to reduce siloes around public systems.

She died shortly after birth due to pulmonary insufficiency. Autopsy confirmed the presence of MP and ascites, and additionally revealed intestinal malrotation, volvulus, necrosis and perforation, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was also noted. This was an unexpected finding as the mother was tested negative for CMV IgM at 2 gestational weeks after sonographic detection of fetal ascites. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in a neonate with MP-associated ascites complicated by congenital CMV infection.

Common visualization techniques neglect the temporal aspect of this data, limiting the ability to convey feature motion, or offering the user a complicated visualization. To remedy this, we present an approach-evolution surfaces-focused on the spatiotemporal rendering of user-selected flow features (i.e., vortices). By abstracting the spatial representation of these features, the approach renders their spatiotemporal behavior with reduced visual complexity. The behavior of vortex features is presented as surfaces, with textures indicating properties of motion and evolution events (e.g., bifurcation and amalgamation) represented by the surface topology. We evaluated the approach on two data sets generated from empirical measurement and computational simulation (Re = 2 00 and Re = 1200, respectively). Our approach's focus on handling evolution events makes it capable of visualizing higher Reynolds number (Re) flows than other surface-based techniques.

Recently, however, initial testing has been found to have a protective effect against misinformation introduced via cued-recall questions. We examined whether misinformation format (narrative vs. cued-recall questions) yields a similar dissociation in a paradigm that, to date, has consistently yielded a protective effect of testing (PET). After studying photos of household scenes (e.g., kitchen), some participants took an initial recall test. After a 48-hr delay, items not presented in the scenes (e.g., knives/plates) were suggested either via narrative or questions. Regardless of the misinformation format, we found a PET on both initial-test-conditionalised free recall and source-monitoring tests.

Increasing or decreasing interface resistance by means of surface-active agents is of interest in applications ranging from biomedicine to petroleum recovery. This paper describes a pressure-decay methodthat allows systematic investigation of both interface resistance and internal (diffusive) resistance during gas-to-liquid mass transfer; introduces a mathematical modeling approach that determines both resistances simultaneously; and provides experiments in which only the interface resistance varies. In the pressure decay method, the system pressure is recorded as gas transfers across the gas/liquid interface and diffuses within the liquid. It allows initiating the experiment at a prescribed pressure with high reproducibility, facilitating the interpretation of a series of experiments. The exact solution of the 1D resistance-in-series model is derived. An accurate approximation is further reported to analyze experiments conveniently. The interface resistance is systematically varied in a static nitrogen/water system by adding small concentrations of oleic acid. As the concentration of oleic acid increases, the mass transfer coefficient decreases or the interface resistance increases. The effect is significant: at a concentration of 2 ppm, at which concentration the interface resistance is almost four times greater than that for pure water. The oleic acid has little effect on the diffusion coefficient of nitrogen in water due to its low concentration. The model comparison indicates the range of Biot number when the interface resistance or internal resistance must be accounted for. The characteristic chart can effectively contribute to a qualitative analysis of the gas–liquid mass transfer process when the effect of surface-active agents is considered.",2020-05-01,Chemical Engineering Journal,https://openalex.org/V149937609,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124108,124108,124108,387,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002239342,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124108,journal-article,3002239342

Methods and Materials Prostate plans of 23 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Interinstitutional plan quality comparisons were made based on distributions of protocol-specified parameters using 1-way analysis of variance with Games-Howell post hoc analysis. Dosimetrically representative cases were selected from each center using k-medoid clustering, enabling side-by-side comparison of dose-volume histograms and dose distributions. Fourteen anatomic features were investigated to explore interinstitutional patient population differences. Anatomically representative cases were selected from each center to explore differences in planning practices. Tumor control probability (TCP), as well as rectal wall and bladder wall normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs), were calculated to quantify the clinical effect of the differences in plan quality. Results Comparing the mean value of each center to the other 3, statistically significant differences were observed for bladder wall D30% and D50%, left and right femoral heads D5%, planning target volume D99% and D1cc, and clinical target volume D99%. Dosimetrically representative cases demonstrated consistent results. Although anatomic differences were observed between the center-specific populations, an analysis using anatomically similar cases demonstrated consistent trends in the dosimetric differences, suggesting the dosimetric variation is not exclusively due to anatomic differences. Minimal differences ( Conclusions Despite common guidelines, statistically significant differences in plan quality metrics occurred among the 4 investigated centers. The differences are due at least in part to variation in local planning practices. TCP and NTCP calculations suggest that the clinical significance of the differences is minimal.

MTFMT formylates a portion of Met-tRNAMet, which allows for translation initiation of mitochondrial mRNA. Mutations in this gene have been shown to result in decreased mitochondrial translation with reduction function of the electron transport chain complexes I, III, IV, and V, thus affecting cellular energy production. Our patient presented with severe lactic acidosis in the neonatal period, and was found to be homozygous for the pathogenic mutation c.994C > T, p.(Arg332*). Her blood lactate levels normalized and her cardiomyopathy reversed after initiation of dichloroacetate (30 mg/kg/day). After two years of follow-up, she continues to show long-term lactate stability, continues to make developmental gains, and is in overall good general health. This is the first report using dichloroacetate in a patient with MTFMT deficiency, which may be a potential therapeutic option that warrants further study.",2020-06-15,Molecular genetics and metabolism reports,https://openalex.org/V2764617610,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2020.100616,,,,,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034455830,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2020.100616,journal-article,3034455830

Using the same sampling design, paired, full-term, arterial, and venous umbilical cord samples and intrapartum chart records were obtained at the time of vaginal delivery (N = 167, 8 male) or emergency C-section (N = 38, 2 male). Eight steroids were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (adrenal glucocorticoids [cortisol, corticosterone], sequential cortisol precursor steroids [17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol], cortisol and corticosterone metabolites [cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone], and gonadal steroids [androstenedione, testosterone]). Fetal sex was not significant in any analytic models. Going through both phase  and phase 2 labor increased fetal adrenal steroidogenesis and decreased male testosterone relative to emergency C-sections that do not reach stage 2 of labor (ie, head compressions) and elective C-sections with no labor. Sum adrenal steroid molarity arriving in venous serum was almost double the equivalent metric for deliveries without labor. No effects of operative vaginal delivery were noted. Maternal regional anesthetic suppressed venous concentrations, and fetal synthesis replaced that steroid. Approximate molar equivalence between substrate pool depletion and net glucocorticoid synthesis was seen. Paired venous and arterial umbilical cord serum has the potential to identify sex differences that underlie antenatal programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in later life. However, stage 2 labor before the collection of serum, and regional anesthetic for the mother, mask those sex differences.",2020-02-01,Journal of the Endocrine Society,https://openalex.org/V2735747656,The Endocrine Society,https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvz041,,,,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997896543,https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvz041,journal-article,2997896543

One hundred thirty-two foot MRIs ordered to assess for OM were enrolled, and the following items were extracted from the clinical reports: use of IV contrast, the presence of OM, reactive osteitis, and a soft tissue abscess. Using only one T1 nonfat-suppressed and one fluid sensitive fat-suppressed sequences, two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed each case for the presence of OM, reactive osteitis, or an abscess. A Kappa test was calculated to assess for interobserver agreement, and diagnostic performance was determined. The McNemar test was used to assess for the effect of contrast. Agreement between both observers and the clinical report on the presence of osteomyelitis was substantial ( k = 0.63 and 0.72, p < 0.001), while the agreement for abscess was fair (k = 0.29 and 0.38, p < 0.001). For osteomyelitis, both observers showed good accuracy (0.85 and 0.86). When screening bone for a normal versus abnormal case, this method was highly sensitive (0.97–0.98), but was less sensitive for abscess (0.63–0.75). Fifty-one percent of exams used contrast, and it did impact the diagnosis of abscess for one observer. This rapid protocol is accurate in making the diagnosis of OM, and its high sensitivity makes it useful to screen for patients that would benefit from a full protocol.",2020-01-14,Skeletal Radiology,https://openalex.org/V66559934,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-019-03367-x,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999700074,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-019-03367-x,journal-article,2999700074

Methods In a randomised controlled trial, the VTP—a 10-session mindfulness-based group intervention including a booster session after  months—was compared with a control group that received routine care plus a CD for voluntary use with mindfulness-based home exercises. The primary outcome was psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire-20. Self-efficacy (pain and symptoms) and emotion-focused coping (emotional processing and expression) were used as co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included pain, fatigue, patient global disease activity, self-care ability and well-being. Effects were estimated by mixed models repeated measures post-intervention and at 12-month follow-up. Results Of 7 participants randomised, 6 completed assessments post-intervention and 6 at 12 months. Significant treatment effects in favour of the VTP group were found post-treatment and maintained at 12 months in psychological distress (adjusted mean between-group difference −3.7, 95% CI −6.3 to −1.1), self-efficacy pain (9.1, 95% CI 3.4 to 14.8) and symptoms (13.1, 95% CI 6.7 to 19.3), emotional processing (0.3, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.5), fatigue (−1.1, 95% CI −1.8 to −0.4), self-care ability (1.0, 95% CI 0. to 1.6) and overall well-being (0.6, 95% CI 0. to 1.2). No significant group differences were found in emotional expression, pain or disease activity. Conclusion The VTP improved most primary and secondary outcomes compared with individual use of CD exercises. Improvements were maintained at 12 months, suggesting that the VTP is a beneficial complement to existing treatments for patients with inflammatory rheumatic joint diseases.",2020-01-01,Canadian Family Physician,https://openalex.org/V72111607,The College of Family Physicians of Canada,https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/66/1/14.full.pdf,14,18,66,1,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004971027,,journal-article,3004971027
