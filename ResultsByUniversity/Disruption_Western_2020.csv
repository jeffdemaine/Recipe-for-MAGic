Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 2 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",2020-04-24,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232391,e0232391,e0232391,15,4,1,462,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3019119825,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232391,journal-article,3019119825

A scoping review,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background</h3> Infection by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reportedly associated with a high risk of thrombotic complications. So far information is scarce and rapidly emerging. <h3>Methods</h3> We conducted a scoping review using a single engine search for studies assessing thrombosis and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Additional studies were identified by secondary review and alert services. <h3>Results</h3> Studies reported the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and stroke in approximately 20% and 3% of patients, respectively. A higher frequency seems to be present in severely ill patients, in particular those admitted to intensive care units. The thrombotic risk is elevated despite the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis but optimal doses of anticoagulation are not yet defined. Although an increase of biomarkers such as D-dimer has been consistently reported in severely ill COVID-19, the optimal cut-off level and prognostic value are not known. <h3>Discussion</h3> A number of pressing issues were identified by this review, including defining the true incidence of VTE in COVID patients, developing algorithms to identify those susceptible to develop thrombotic complications and severe disease, determining the role of biomarkers and/or scoring systems to stratify patients' risk, designing adequate and feasible diagnostic protocols for PE, establishing the optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy, and developing uniform diagnostic and reporting criteria.",2020-05-27,Thrombosis Research,https://openalex.org/V134546602,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.05.039,152,160,192,,1,207,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032541896,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.05.039,journal-article,3032541896

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a single-bundle, hamstring ACLR in combination with a lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) would reduce the risk of ACLR failure in young, active individuals. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing a single-bundle, hamstring tendon ACLR with or without LET performed using a strip of iliotibial band. Patients 2 years or younger with an ACL-deficient knee were included and also had to meet at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: (1) grade 2 pivot shift or greater, (2) a desire to return to high-risk/pivoting sports, (3) and generalized ligamentous laxity (GLL). The primary outcome was ACLR clinical failure, a composite measure of rotatory laxity or a graft rupture. Secondary outcome measures included the P4 pain scale, Marx Activity Rating Scale, Knee injury Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee score, and ACL Quality of Life Questionnaire. Patients were reviewed at 3, 6, 12, and  months postoperatively. Results: A total of 6 patients (29 males; 48%) with a mean age of 18.9 years (range, 14-25 years) were randomized. A total of 4 (87.9%) patients presented preoperatively with high-grade rotatory laxity (grade 2 pivot shift or greater), and 2 (42.1%) were diagnosed as having GLL. There were  patients lost to follow-up and  who withdrew (~5%). In the ACLR group, 120/298 (40%) patients sustained the primary outcome of clinical failure, compared with 72/291 (25%) in the ACLR+LET group (relative risk reduction [RRR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.52; P &lt; .0001). A total of  patients experienced graft rupture, 34/298 (11%) in the ACLR group compared with 11/291 (4%) in the ACL+LET group (RRR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.36-0.83; P &lt; .001). The number needed to treat with LET to prevent  patient from graft rupture was 14.3 over the first 2 postoperative years. At 3 months, patients in the ACLR group had less pain as measured by the P4 ( P = .003) and KOOS ( P = .007), with KOOS pain persisting in favor of the ACLR group to  months ( P = .02). No clinically important differences in patient-reported outcome measures were found between groups at other time points. The level of sports activity was similar between groups at 2 years after surgery, as measured by the Marx Activity Rating Scale ( P = .11). Conclusion: The addition of LET to a single-bundle hamstring tendon autograft ACLR in young patients at high risk of failure results in a statistically significant, clinically relevant reduction in graft rupture and persistent rotatory laxity at 2 years after surgery.

Changes in temperature, ocean acidification, precipitation, nutrient stress or availability, and the physical structure of the water column all influence the productivity, composition, and global range of phytoplankton assemblages, but large uncertainty remains about how integration of these climate drivers might shape future HABs. Presented here are the collective deliberations from a symposium on HABs and climate change where the research challenges to understanding potential linkages between HABs and climate were considered, along with new research directions to better define these linkages. In addition to the likely effects of physical (temperature, salinity, stratification, light, changing storm intensity), chemical (nutrients, ocean acidification), and biological (grazer) drivers on microalgae (senso lato), symposium participants explored more broadly the subjects of cyanobacterial HABs, benthic HABs, HAB effects on fisheries, HAB modelling challenges, and the contributions that molecular approaches can bring to HAB studies. There was consensus that alongside traditional research, HAB scientists must set new courses of research and practices to deliver the conceptual and quantitative advances required to forecast future HAB trends. These different practices encompass laboratory and field studies, long-term observational programs, retrospectives, as well as the study of socioeconomic drivers and linkages with aquaculture and fisheries. In anticipation of growing HAB problems, research on potential mitigation strategies should be a priority. It is recommended that a substantial portion of HAB research among laboratories be directed collectively at a small sub-set of HAB species and questions in order to fast-track advances in our understanding. Climate-driven changes in coastal oceanographic and ecological systems are becoming substantial, in some cases exacerbated by localized human activities.

Numerous review papers have addressed lignin research; though, a limited focus has been given to lignin commercial initiatives and its market applications potential. However, this is an area of great importance, given the growth of commercial lignin production. For instance, expressed in the strategic directions taken by pulp mills with kraft lignin valorization as a primary pathway in their transformation to the biorefinery. This work aims to provide concrete information on the global lignin market and supply, and to discuss its most explored applications - these being phenols and polyols due to their importance in short- and mid-terms lignin market development. Over the years, lignosulfonates have dominated the market. However, kraft lignin production increased by 150% from 2014 to 2018, competing with lignosulfonates to some extent. Even with the increased kraft lignin precipitation, it should remain a bioenergy source for kraft mills in the short- and mid-terms, with only its surplus being directed to biochemicals and biomaterials. The most demonstrated market application of kraft lignin is the production of biophenol, with biopolyol as a prone application in the mid-term. In both cases, lignin modification to obtain uniform and reactive biochemicals could allow faster market penetration. Besides, phenol and polyol markets are expected to grow globally providing an opportunity for biopolymers.

However, nonuniform Li+ deposition leads to hazardous dendrite growth and poor electrochemical performance, which still severely hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries. Herein, we propose a bifunctional composite separator to guide homogenous Li+ deposition, which smartly learns abundant experience from the dendrite-free design of solid-state batteries. A hierarchical porous composite solid-state electrolyte (CSE) consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is coated on one side of polypropylene (PP) separator to fabricate the composite separator. The interactions between PVDF and LLZTO provide a three-dimensional fast Li+ channel along the PVDF, LLZTO, and PVDF/LLZTO interfaces, which can effectively redistribute uneven Li+ flux coming from the insulated PP separator. In addition, the CSE layer can further immobilize the anions, regulating a facile Li+ transport to evenly deposit on the Li anode. The synergetic effects between Li+ redistribution and anion immobilization result in higher Coulombic efficiency and enhanced cycling stability for Li metal batteries. This work presents fresh insights into CSE modified PP separator, which is an effective and simple solid-state-battery strategy for protected Li metal anodes and large-scale production.",2020-08-01,Energy Storage Materials,https://openalex.org/V2764728150,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2019.12.022,361,366,29,,0,95,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994660335,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2019.12.022,journal-article,2994660335

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential for HCWs to recognize which procedures are potentially aerosolizing so that appropriate infection prevention precautions can be taken. The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. Methods A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. Results Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission.

Initial scholarly engagements with platform urbanism have tended to coalesce around critiques of digital platforms as progenitors of inevitably dystopian urban futures. In this paper, I advance a counter-topographical minor theory of platform urbanism. I do so by drawing on Legacy Russell's notion of the glitch as a tendency toward both error and erratum (correction) in digital systems, mobilizing space/times where platforms appear ‘glitchy’—unexpectedly, otherwise than anticipated, or not at all—as the margins of platform urbanism. Through the narration of three specific platform/city interfaces from the minors of their glitchy margins, I capture the ways in which platform–urban configurations are demonstrably open to negotiations, reconfigurations, and diffractions through tactical maneuvers rooted in everyday digital practices of urban denizens. Theorized from the minor, platform urbanism is a phenomenon that may beget an array of possible outcomes that remain shapeable by mundane tactical interventions in the platform-mediated present. This ultimately underwrites possibilities for more hopeful digital urban politics, theory, and futures.",2020-04-01,Environment And Planning D: Society And Space,https://openalex.org/V4210219814,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775819878721,189,208,38,2,0,82,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978834101,https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775819878721,journal-article,2978834101

Methods In a systematic search of publications, through March 18, 2018, we identified 1 observational studies (>500 person-years) of patients with IBD treated with TNF antagonists, non-TNF targeted biologics, tofacitinib, and/or immunosuppressive agents (thiopurines, methotrexate) that reported risk of serious infections. Only studies with active comparators were included, to allow appropriate comparative synthesis. We performed random-effects meta-analysis and estimated relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs. Results Compared with anti-TNF monotherapy, risk of serious infection increased with the combination of anti-TNF and an immunosuppressive agent (in  cohorts: RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37), with anti-TNF and a corticosteroid (in  cohorts: RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33–2.03), or with all  drugs (in  cohorts: RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.77); there was minimal heterogeneity among studies. In contrast, monotherapy with an immunosuppressive agent was associated with a lower risk of serious infections than monotherapy with a TNF antagonist ( cohorts: RR, 0.61; 95% CI 0.44–0.84) or a TNF antagonist with an immunosuppressive agent ( cohorts: RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39–0.81). Infliximab-based therapy was associated with a lower risk of serious infections compared with adalimumab-based therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (4 cohorts: RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33–0.97), but not Crohn's disease (4 cohorts: RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.49–1.70). Few data were available on the comparative safety of biologic agents that do not inhibit TNF and tofacitinib. Conclusions Combination therapies for IBD that include TNF antagonists, especially with corticosteroids, are associated with a higher risk of serious infection, whereas monotherapy with an immunosuppressive agent is associated with a lower risk, compared with monotherapy with a TNF antagonist.

This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available.",2020-06-01,Canadian Journal of Cardiology,https://openalex.org/V126162762,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.003,948,951,36,6,1,81,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015826819,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.003,journal-article,3015826819

In this study, a facile pyrolyzation method is proposed for synthesizing the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on B/N–doped graphene (BNG) (denoted as Ru NCs/BNG). During the pyrolyzation, boron was doped into graphene and facilitated the formation of ultra−small Ru NCs with a diameter of 0.5–1 nm. The electronic interaction between B and Ru NCs accelerated the cleavage of H–OH, altering the HER mechanism and lowering the activation energy of H2 formation, endowing Ru NCs/BNG with excellent alkaline HER activity, even surpassing that of Pt/C.

Data after 2-yr follow-up are now available for analysis. Objective To determine if there was a difference in the AS failure rate in a 2-yr follow-up period among men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initial confirmatory biopsy (CBx) compared to those who did not. Design, setting, and participants This is the 2-yr post-CBx follow-up for the ASIST trial, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study for men with Gleason grade group (GG)  cancer eligible for AS. Patients were randomized to CBx with 12-core systematic sampling or MRI with systematic and targeted sampling. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Patients with GG ≤ 1 on CBx were followed for 2 yr and had MRI and biopsy at that time point. Patients failed AS if they were no longer under AS because of grade progression, clinical progression, subject choice, clinical judgment, treatment, or lost to follow-up. Clinically significant cancer (CSC) was defined as GG ≥ 2. Results and limitations In total, 25 men underwent CBx, 13 in the non-MRI and 12 in the MRI arm. After biopsy, 10 men in the non-MRI arm (76%) and 9 in the MRI arm (77%) continued AS. There were fewer men with AS failures in the MRI (19/98, 19%) compared to the non-MRI group (35/101, 35%; p =  0.017). At 2-yr biopsy there were fewer men with CSC in the MRI arm (9.9%, 8/81) than in the non-MRI arm (23%, 17/75; p =  0.048). Significant differences in AS failure rates were detected across the three centers in the MRI arm only (4.2% [2/48] vs 17% [4/24] vs 27% [7/26]; p =  0.019). Conclusions Baseline MRI before CBx during AS results in 50% fewer AS failures and less grade progression over 2 yr. The center where MRI and targeted biopsy is performed may influence AS failure rates. Patient summary The ASIST trial randomized 27 men on active surveillance with low-grade prostate cancer diagnosed within the last year to systematic biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with systematic and targeted biopsy. The initial report showed little benefit from targeted biopsy. However, after 2 yr of follow-up we found that baseline MRI before confirmatory biopsy resulted in 50% fewer failures of surveillance and less progression to higher-grade cancer. This confirms the value of MRI in men on surveillance.

One of the promising biomass conversion routes is the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass for producing H2 or combustible gases. SCWG is an effective conversion technology, particularly for high water-containing feedstocks, because of its unique advantage by avoiding the costly feedstock de-watering/drying process. To improve gasification performance, it is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the basic chemistry and kinetics of biomass SCWG. Therefore, this review focuses on the performance (chemistry and kinetics) of SCWG of biomass model compounds (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipid, and protein), and more importantly the binary or multi-component systems to elucidate the interaction effects induced by two or more biomass components in supercritical water (SCW).

However, for process optimization, it is important to understand the fundamental phenomenon involved in hydrothermal gasification of synthetic biomass or biomass model compounds, namely cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. In this study, the response surface methodology using the Box-Behnken design was applied for the first time to optimize the process parameters during hydrothermal (subcritical and supercritical water) gasification of cellulose. The process parameters investigated include temperature (300–500 °C), reaction time (30–60 min) and feedstock concentration (10–30 wt%). Temperature was found to be the most significant factor that influenced the yields of hydrogen and total gases. Furthermore, negligible interaction was found between lower temperatures and reaction time while the interaction became dominant at higher temperatures. Hydrogen yield remained at about 0.8 mmol/g with an increase in the reaction time from 30 min to 60 min at the temperature range of 300–400 °C. When the temperature was raised to 500 °C, hydrogen yield started to elevate at longer reaction time. Maximum hydrogen yield of 1.95 mmol/g was obtained from supercritical water gasification of cellulose alone at 500 °C with 12.5 wt% feedstock concentration in 60 min.

These epigenetic analyses have involved investigations of joint development, homeostasis and disease and have used both human samples and animal models. What has become apparent from a comparison of these two complementary approaches is that many OA genetic risk signals interact with, map to or correlate with epigenetic mediators. This discovery implies that epigenetic mechanisms, and their effect on gene expression, are a major conduit through which OA genetic risk polymorphisms exert their functional effects.

The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive shift in the microbiota composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, and improve survival during P. larvae infection.

In the past decades, extensive research has applied a wide range of thermo-chemical technologies for converting biomass into value-added products. Among them, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is regarded to be one of the most effective techniques to produce bio-fuels and bio-based chemicals. However, there are still several technical barriers that must be addressed before the industrialization of HTL technology. Although many previous reviews have summarized the reaction mechanism, properties of liquefaction products, and various operating parameters, few articles have discussed the potential applications of HTL products and the techno-economic problems facing by the industrialization of HTL. Therefore, in this review, the possible applications of HTL products (bio-crude, aqueous phase, solid residue, and gas) were thoroughly discussed. In addition, the current challenges of HTL treatment, especially for the continuous operation, to produce bio-based fuel and chemicals is reviewed.

The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic not only has high Na+ ion conductivity, but also prevents potential contamination from H2O and CO2 to sodium anode, and avoids the internal short-circuit touch of Na dendrite with cathode, improving the safety of the battery. Benefiting from N dopants, unique internal and interstitial nanoporous structures, N-SWCNH have large surface area for discharge products accumulation, offer substantial structural defect sites for CO2 adsorption and electron transfer, contributing to high catalytic activity and reversibility. Most importantly, the hybrid Na-CO2 battery with aqueous electrolyte facilitates the dissolution of the insulated discharge product, which overwhelmingly improves the discharge and charge reactions kinetics. Na-CO2 batteries exhibit a low charging voltage of 2.62 V and a small voltage gap of 0.49 V at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, a superior discharge capacity of 229 mAh·g−1 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2, a high round trip efficiency of ~68.7% after 30 cycles.

After multiple failed therapies, combining two biologic therapies is possibly the sole medical alternative to recurrent surgery. However, data on this approach are limited. AIMS To assess the efficacy and safety of concomitant use of two biologic therapies in the largest cohort to date of refractory Crohn's disease patients. METHODS Data were extracted from Crohn's disease patients started on dual biologic therapy at two referral centres. Biologics utilised include infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, certolizumab and golimumab. The primary outcome was endoscopic improvement (>50% reduction in Simplified Endoscopic Score-Crohn's disease [SES-CD] or explicitly stated). Endoscopic remission (SES-CD < 3 or stated), clinical response (Crohn's disease-patient-reported outcome-2 score [PRO2] reduced by 8), clinical remission (PRO2 < 8), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 2 patients with 2 therapeutic trials of dual biologic therapy were identified. The majority of patients had prior surgical resections (91%), stricturing (59%) or penetrating (36%) phenotype, and perianal fistulas (50%). Median number of prior failed biologics was 4. Endoscopic improvement occurred in 43% of trials and 26% achieved endoscopic remission. Fifty per cent had clinical response and 41% achieved clinical remission. There were significant post-treatment reductions in median SES-CD (14.0 [12.0-17.5] to 6.0 [2.5-8.0], P = 0.0005], PRO-2 (24.1 [20.3-27.0] to 13.4 [4.6-21.8], P = 0.002] and CRP (17.0 [11.0-24.0] to 9.0 [4.0-14.0], P = 0.02). Presence of perianal fistulas decreased from 50% to 33%. Adverse events occurred in 13% of trials.

However, the undesired phase transitions and poor electrolyte-electrode interfacial stability facilitate their capacity decay and limit their practical applications. Herein, we design a novel Al2O3@Na0.67Zn0.1Mn0.9O2 electrode to mitigate these problems, by taking the advantages of both structural stabilization and surface passivation via Zn2+ substitution and Al2O3 atomic layered deposition (ALD) coating, respectively. Long-range and local structural analyses during charging/discharging processes indicate that P2–P2’ phase transformation can be suppressed by substituting proper amount of Mn3+ Jahn-Teller centers with Zn2+, whereas excessive Zn2+ leads to P2-OP4 structure transition at low sodium contents and facilitates the electrode degradations. Furthermore, the homogeneous and robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers formed on the Al2O3-coated electrodes effectively hinder the organic electrolytes from further decomposition. Therefore, our synergetic strategy of Zn2+ substitution and ALD surface engineering remarkably boosts the cycling performance of P2–Na0.67MnO2 and provides some new insights into the designing of highly stable cathode electrodes for sustainable sodium ion batteries.",2020-04-01,Energy Storage Materials,https://openalex.org/V2764728150,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2019.11.024,503,512,26,,0,43,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991166903,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2019.11.024,journal-article,2991166903

Objective: We hypothesized that Lp(a) induces endothelial cell inflammation by rewiring endothelial metabolism. Methods and Results: We evaluated the impact of Lp(a) on the endothelium and describe that Lp(a), through its oxidized phospholipid content, activates arterial endothelial cells, facilitating increased transendothelial migration of monocytes. Transcriptome analysis of Lp(a)-stimulated human arterial endothelial cells revealed upregulation of inflammatory pathways comprising monocyte adhesion and migration, coinciding with increased 6-phophofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB)-3–mediated glycolysis. ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule)-1 and PFKFB3 were also found to be upregulated in carotid plaques of patients with elevated levels of Lp(a). Inhibition of PFKFB3 abolished the inflammatory signature with concomitant attenuation of transendothelial migration. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings show that Lp(a) activates the endothelium by enhancing PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis, leading to a proadhesive state, which can be reversed by inhibition of glycolysis.

In this study, we report the design of a nanocomposite DNA-based hydrogel crosslinked with oxidized alginate (OA) via the formation of reversible imine linkages. The formulated hydrogel functioned as an injectable carrier for the sustained delivery of a small molecule drug, simvastatin. The degree of oxidation of alginate and the concentration of silicate-based nanoparticles (nSi) were varied to modulate the rheological properties of the hydrogels. Specifically, the formulations consisting of OA with higher degree of oxidation displayed the highest value of storage moduli, yield stress, yield strain, and rapid recovery after removal of cyclic stress. The hydrogel formulations exhibited self-healing and shear-thinning properties due to the reversible nature of the covalent imine bonds formed between the aldehyde groups of OA and the amine groups present in the DNA nucleotides. Moreover, the incorporation of charged nSi further enhanced the shear strength of the formulated hydrogels by establishing electrostatic interactions with the phosphate groups of the DNA network. The optimized hydrogel was able to promote the sustained release of simvastatin for more than a week. The bioactivity of the released drug was confirmed by testing its ability to induce osteogenic differentiation and migration of human adipose-derived stem cells in vitro. Overall, the results obtained from this study demonstrate that DNA could be used as a natural biopolymer to fabricate self-healing injectable hydrogels with sustained release properties for minimally invasive therapeutic approaches.

However, Li+ transport is usually poor in thick cathodes, resulting in low capacity output, fast capacity decay and large overpotential. To tackle the issue of thick sulfur cathodes, a thickness-independent electrode structure is proposed for the first time which can transform a thick electrode into a combination of vertically aligned “thin electrodes”. Each “thin electrode” has a thickness of ~20 μm, which is independent of the overall thickness of electrode or sulfur loading. The “thin electrodes” substantially enhanced local accessibility to Li+ and e− and enabled similar electrochemical kinetics in spite of the total sulfur loading or thickness of the electrode. Accordingly, highly similar cycling performance and rate performance were demonstrated with the 250 μm and 750 μm (i.e. sulfur loadings of 2 and 6 mg cm−2) electrodes.

However, the mechanisms of TLR4 activation remain unclear. Here we examine the role of myeloid differentiation  (MD2), a co-receptor of TLR4, in high glucose (HG)- and diabetes-induced inflammatory cardiomyopathy. We show increased MD2 in heart tissues of diabetic mice and serum of human diabetic subjects. MD2 deficiency in mice inhibits TLR4 pathway activation, which correlates with reduced myocardial remodeling and improved cardiac function. Mechanistically, we show that HG induces extracellular advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which bind directly to MD2, leading to formation of AGEs-MD2-TLR4 complex and initiation of pro-inflammatory pathways. We further detect elevated AGE-MD2 complexes in heart tissues and serum of diabetic mice and human subjects with DCM. In summary, we uncover a new mechanism of HG-induced inflammatory responses and myocardial injury, in which AGE products directly bind MD2 to drive inflammatory DCM.",2020-05-01,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15978-3,,,11,1,1,40,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021747439,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15978-3,journal-article,3021747439

New strategies are urgently needed to overcome this threat. Using a cell-based screen of ~45,000 diverse synthetic compounds, we discovered a potent bioactive, MAC-545496, that reverses β-lactam resistance in the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain. MAC-545496 could also serve as an antivirulence agent alone; it attenuates MRSA virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae. MAC-545496 inhibits biofilm formation and abrogates intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistic characterization revealed MAC-545496 to be a nanomolar inhibitor of GraR, a regulator that responds to cell-envelope stress and is an important virulence factor and determinant of antibiotic resistance. The small molecule discovered herein is an inhibitor of GraR function. MAC-545496 has value as a research tool to probe the GraXRS regulatory system and as an antibacterial lead series of a mechanism to combat drug-resistant Staphylococcal infections.

In this study, we elucidated this relationship using RS-fMRI and quantitative tracer data in marmosets. In addition, we also elucidated the effects of distance between two brain regions on the relationship between FC and CC across seed region. To calculate FC, we used full correlation approach that is considered to reflect not only direct (monosynaptic connections) but also indirect pathways (polysynaptic connections). Our main findings are that: (1) overall FC obtained by RS-fMRI was highly correlated with tracer-based CC, but correlation coefficients varied remarkably across seed regions; (2) the strength of FC decreased with increase in the distance between two regions; (3) correlation coefficients between FC and CC after regressing out the effects of the distance between two regions still varied across seed regions, but some regions have strong correlations.

This study investigated the effects of viewing 7+ hours of television on incidental vocabulary learning as well as the effects of the frequency and range.

Two vocabulary tests at differing sensitivities were used in a pre- and post-test design measuring receptive knowledge of the form-meaning connection of 60 word-families.

We report that in breast cancer cells NANOG , SNAIL and NODAL transcripts manifest multiple isoforms characterized by different 5’ Untranslated Regions (5’UTRs), whereby translation of a subset of these isoforms is stimulated under hypoxia. The accumulation of the corresponding proteins induces plasticity and “fate-switching” toward stem cell-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, we observe that mTOR inhibitors and chemotherapeutics induce translational activation of a subset of NANOG , SNAIL and NODAL mRNA isoforms akin to hypoxia, engendering stem-cell-like phenotypes. These effects are overcome with drugs that antagonize translational reprogramming caused by eIF2α phosphorylation (e.g. ISRIB), suggesting that the Integrated Stress Response drives breast cancer plasticity.

However, the security of NOMA-UAV systems remains a challenge due to the line-of-sight air-to-ground channels and higher transmission power of weaker users in NOMA. In this paper, we propose two schemes to guarantee the secure transmission in UAV-NOMA networks. When only one user requires secure transmission, we derive the hovering position for the UAV and the power allocation to meet rate threshold of the secure user while maximizing the sum rate of remaining users. This disrupts the eavesdropping towards the secure user effectively. When multiple users require secure transmission, we further take the advantage of beamforming via multiple antennas at the UAV to guarantee their secure transmission. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we convert it into a convex one for an iterative solution by using the second order cone programming. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",2020-02-10,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,https://openalex.org/V10936095,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.2972617,3994,4005,69,4,1,35,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005589427,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2020.2972617,journal-article,3005589427

However, while such approaches may well be more portable, realistic, or satisfying than traditional photographic presentations, it is less clear that they have any superiority in terms of student learning. In this study, it was hypothesized that virtual and mixed reality presentations of pelvic anatomy will have an advantage over two-dimensional (2D) presentations and perform approximately equal to physical models and that this advantage over 2D presentations will be reduced when stereopsis is decreased by covering the non-dominant eye. Groups of 20 undergraduate students learned pelvic anatomy under seven conditions: physical model with and without stereo vision, mixed reality with and without stereo vision, virtual reality with and without stereo vision, and key views on a computer monitor. All were tested with a cadaveric pelvis and a 15-item, short-answer recognition test. Compared to the key views, the physical model had a 70% increase in accuracy in structure identification; the virtual reality a 25% increase, and the mixed reality a non-significant 2.5% change. Blocking stereopsis reduced performance on the physical model by 15%, on virtual reality by 60%, but by only 2.5% on the mixed reality technology.

Despite the barriers to legal gender affirmation for trans people, little is known about its association with mental health. We therefore sought to determine whether having gender-concordant identity documents (IDs) is associated with mental health among trans adults in the USA. We hypothesised that having an ID that reflects one's preferred name and gender marker would be associated with reduced psychological distress and suicide risk.In this cross-sectional observational study, we obtained data from the 201 US Transgender Survey, the largest cross-sectional survey of trans adults in the USA, with 2 71 participants. Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years), residing in a US state, territory, or overseas US military base; and considered themselves transgender, trans, genderqueer, non-binary, or similar. We excluded participants not living day-to-day in a different gender to the sex they were assigned at birth, participants who identified as crossdressers, and those missing data. The primary exposure of interest was whether all or some (vs none) of a respondent's IDs reflected their preferred name and gender marker. We examined associations with psychological distress (measured with the Kessler  scale) and suicide ideation, planning, and attempts in the past year, which we analysed using linear and modified Poisson regression models to examine associations with respondents' IDs.Of 2 28 respondents included in our analytic sample, 1 28 (weighted percentage 45·1%) had their preferred name and gender marker on none, 966 (44·2%) on some, and 23 (10·7%) on all of their IDs. Compared with those with no gender-concordant ID, respondents for whom all IDs were concordant had lower prevalence of serious psychological distress (adjusted prevalence ratio 0·68, 95% CI 0·61-0·76), suicidal ideation (0·78, 0·72-0·85), and suicide planning (0·75, 0·64-0·87), adjusting for potential confounders. Having some versus no concordant ID was generally associated with smaller reductions in distress and suicidality.

Recent data suggest that a stiff ECM, generated by CAFs, and associated integrin-dependent signaling underlies the development of drug resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma. Drugs targeting the matricellular protein CCN2 (centralized communication network 2, formerly termed connective tissue growth factor), are in clinical development for cancers; for example, FG-3019, an antibody targeting CCN2 has recently entered Phase III trials for pancreatic cancer. Recent data show that fibroblast-specific production of CCN2, which signals through integrins and whose overexpression in human melanomas is independent of BRAF mutational status, is essential for neovascularization, including vasculogenic mimicry, in melanoma. In clinical melanoma samples, a FAP/ITGA11/COL1A1/CCN2-expressing CAF population negatively correlates with disease-free survival. These data emphasize the essential role for a CCN2-expressing subset of CAFs in cancer progression and suggest that targeting the CAFs in the tumor microenvironment, for example by blocking the action of CCN2, may be useful in combination therapies to treat cancers.",2020-05-01,Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology,https://openalex.org/V105347553,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.10.016,111,114,101,,0,33,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2986559221,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.10.016,journal-article,2986559221

All the existing algorithms for IPPS are heuristic-based search methods and no research has investigated the use of exact solution methods for this problem. We develop several decomposition approaches based on the logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) algorithm. Our LBBD algorithm allows us to partition the decision variables in the IPPS problem into two models, master-problem and sub-problem. The master-problem determines process plan and operation-machine assignment, while the sub-problem optimizes sequencing and scheduling decisions. To achieve faster convergence, we develop two relaxations for the optimal makespan objective function and incorporate them into the master-problem. We analyze the performance and further enhance the algorithm with two ideas, a Benders optimality cut based on the critical path and a faster heuristic way to solve the sub-problem. 16 standard benchmark instances available in the literature are solved to evaluate and compare the performances of our algorithms with those of the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

The resulting optimization problems can be simplified and solved utilizing the prior knowledge and properties of SSVEPs across different stimuli. With the new learning scheme, the eCCA and the eTRCA can be extended to the multi-stimulus eCCA (ms-eCCA) and the multi-stimulus eTRCA (ms-eTRCA), respectively, as well as a combination of them (i.e., ms-eCCA + ms-eTRCA) that incorporates their merits.a#13; alt;iagt;Main resultsalt;/iagt;: Evaluation and comparison using an SSVEP-BCI benchmark dataset with 35 subjects show that the ms-eCCA (or ms-eTRCA) performs significantly better than the eCCA (or eTRCA) method while the ms-eCCA+ms-eTRCA performs the best.

The coated NMC811 cathode releases ~55.3% less heat under thermal abuse and largely enhances his safety feature during puncture test.

This important role in modern agriculture has rendered honey bees vulnerable to the noxious effects of anthropogenic stressors such as pesticides. Although the deleterious outcomes of lethal pesticide exposure on honey bee health and performance are apparent, the ominous role of sublethal pesticide exposure is an emerging concern as well. Here, we use a data harvesting approach to better understand the toxicological effects of pesticide exposure across the honey bee life cycle. Through compiling adult- and larval-specific median lethal dose (LD50) values from 93 published data sources, LD50 estimates for insecticides, herbicides, acaricides, and fungicides are highly variable across studies, especially for herbicides and fungicides, which are underrepresented in the meta-data set. Alongside major discrepancies in these reported values, further examination of the compiled data suggested that LD50 may not be an ideal metric for honey bee risk assessment. We also discuss how sublethal effects of pesticide exposure, which are not typically measured in LD50 studies, can diminish honey bee reproduction, immunity, cognition, and overall physiological functioning, leading to suboptimal honey bee performance and population reduction. In consideration of actionable solutions to mitigate the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure, we have identified the potential for probiotic supplementation as a promising strategy that can be easily incorporated alongside current agricultural infrastructure and apicultural management practices. Probiotic supplementation is regularly employed in apiculture but the potential for evidence-based targeted approaches has not yet been fully explored within a formal toxicological context. We discuss the benefits, practical considerations, and limitations for the use and delivery of probiotics to hives.

The Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR) serves as the most important indicator for glaucoma screening and plays a significant role in clinical screening and early diagnosis of glaucoma. In general, obtaining CDR is subjected to measuring on manually or automatically segmented optic disc and cup. Despite great efforts have been devoted, obtaining CDR values automatically with high accuracy and robustness is still a great challenge due to the heavy overlap between optic cup and neuroretinal rim regions. In this paper, a direct CDR estimation method is proposed based on the well-designed semi-supervised learning scheme, in which CDR estimation is formulated as a general regression problem while optic disc/cup segmentation is cancelled. The method directly regresses CDR value based on the feature representation of optic nerve head via deep learning technique while bypassing intermediate segmentation. The scheme is a two-stage cascaded approach comprised of two phases: unsupervised feature representation of fundus image with a convolutional neural networks (MFPPNet) and CDR value regression by random forest regressor. The proposed scheme is validated on the challenging glaucoma dataset Direct-CSU and public ORIGA, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve a lower average CDR error of 0.056 and a higher correlation of around 0.72 with measurement before manual segmentation of optic disc/cup by human experts.

Boreal forests play a large role in the global carbon cycle, and the responses of northern trees to climate change will thus impact the trajectory of future CO2 increases. We grew two North American boreal tree species at a range of future climate conditions to assess how growth and carbon fluxes were altered by high CO2 and warming. Black spruce (Picea mariana, an evergreen conifer) and tamarack (Larix laricina, a deciduous conifer) were grown under ambient (40 ppm) or elevated CO2 (75 ppm) and either ambient temperatures, a 4°C warming, or an 8°C warming. In both species, the thermal optimum of net photosynthesis (ToptA ) increased and maximum photosynthetic rates declined in warm-grown seedlings, but the strength of these changes varied between species. Photosynthetic capacity (maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation, Vcmax , and of electron transport, Jmax ) was reduced in warm-grown seedlings, correlating with reductions in leaf N and chlorophyll concentrations. Warming increased the activation energy for Vcmax and Jmax (EaV and EaJ , respectively) and the thermal optimum for Jmax . In both species, the ToptA was positively correlated with both EaV and EaJ , but negatively correlated with the ratio of Jmax /Vcmax . Respiration acclimated to elevated temperatures, but there were no treatment effects on the Q10 of respiration (the increase in respiration for a 10°C increase in leaf temperature). A warming of 4°C increased biomass in tamarack, while warming reduced biomass in spruce.

The DSTGAN is implemented using a conditional generative model, which conditions the distributions of the objective cine MR image to directly optimize the generalized error of the mapping between the input and the output. The method consists of the following: (1) A multi-level and multi-scale spatiotemporal variation encoder learns a coarse to fine hierarchical feature to effectively encode the MI-specific morphological and kinematic abnormality structures, which vary for different spatial locations and time periods. (2) The top-down and cross-task generators learn the shared representations between segmentation and quantification to use the commonalities and differences between the two related tasks and enhance the generator preference. (3) Three inter-/intra-tasks to label the relatedness discriminators are iteratively imposed on the encoder and generator to detect and correct the inconsistencies in the label relatedness between and within tasks via adversarial learning.

Accuracy metrics were pooled using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of multiple covariates was assessed using meta-regression. PROSPERO ID: CRD 42018111287. Thirty-eight studies reporting on 488,099 patients (13,923 with breast cancer) were included. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias. DBT alone, combined DBT and DM, and DM alone demonstrated sensitivities of 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83–92), 88% (CI 83–92), and 79% (CI 75–82), as well as specificities of 84% (CI 76–89), 81% (CI 73–88), and 79% (CI 71–85), respectively. The greater sensitivities of DBT alone and combined DBT and DM compared to DM alone were preserved in the combined meta-regression models accounting for other covariates (p = 0.003–0.006). No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between DBT alone and combined DBT and DM was identified (p = 0.175–0.581). DBT is more sensitive than DM, while the addition of DM to DBT provides no additional diagnostic benefit. Consideration of these findings in breast cancer imaging guidelines is recommended. • Digital breast tomosynthesis with or without additional digital mammography is more sensitive in detecting breast cancer than digital mammography alone in women at average risk for breast cancer.
 • The addition of digital mammography to digital breast tomosynthesis provides no additional diagnostic benefit in detecting breast cancer compared to digital breast tomosynthesis alone.
 • The specificity of digital breast tomosynthesis with or without additional digital mammography is no different than digital mammography alone in the detection of breast cancer.",2020-01-03,European Radiology,https://openalex.org/V4819472,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06549-2,2058,2071,30,4,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996762549,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06549-2,journal-article,2996762549

In this paper, we describe newly emerging clusters of events occurring in previously quiescent (and undeveloped) areas of the Duvernay Formation. In the Duvernay East Shale Basin, an industry supplemented waveform database is examined using a variety of seismological techniques. Here, strike-slip events as large as 4.18 ML have been felt in nearby cities. Temporal relationships suggest these clusters are almost certainly (>99.7% confidence) caused by nearby HF. Spatially, these earthquakes tend to occur in the strata directly overlying the Duvernay Formation and laterally near a horizontal well. One exceptional cluster clearly delineates a 1.5 km offset between its centroid and the inducing horizontal well, raising questions about the earthquake triggering mechanism. Westward in the Duvernay, two minor clusters within the Willesden Green region appear to be tenuously related to HF completions. This study also places constraints on the structural geology of faulting occurring in the Rocky Mountain House Seismogenic Zone – a region of induced seismicity related to secondary recovery in the Strachan D-3A pool. Here, our moment tensors and double difference relocations describe thrust-slip on a fault underlying the target formation. Last, the largest event (4.27 ML) in our study area was likely natural, due to its deeper hypocentral depth (~15 km) and non-correspondence with industrial operations. Overall, the newly emerging clusters are consistent with reactivation of basement rooted faults.",2020-03-20,Tectonophysics,https://openalex.org/V195250905,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2020.228393,228393,228393,779,,0,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009018953,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2020.228393,journal-article,3009018953

Understanding serious complications and how they can be prevented is important. The primary objectives were to determine the incidence of serious cardiac events (SCEs) in pregnant women with heart disease, whether they were preventable, and their impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. Serious obstetric events were also examined. A prospectively assembled cohort of 1,315 pregnancies in women with heart disease was studied. SCEs included cardiac death or arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or arrhythmias requiring admission to an intensive care unit, myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic dissection, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, and urgent cardiac intervention. The Harvard Medical Study criteria were used to adjudicate preventability. Overall, 3.6% of pregnancies (47 of 1,315) were complicated by SCEs. The most frequent SCEs were cardiac death or arrest, heart failure, arrhythmias, and urgent interventions. Most SCEs (66%) occurred in the antepartum period. Almost one-half of SCEs (49%) were preventable; the majority of preventable SCEs (74%) were secondary to provider management factors. Adverse fetal and neonatal events were more common in pregnancies with SCEs compared with those without cardiac events (62% vs. 29%; p < 0.001). Serious obstetric events were less common (1.7%) and were primarily due to pre-eclampsia with severe features. Pregnant women with heart disease are at risk for serious cardiac complications, and approximately one-half of all SCEs are preventable.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Injury, Running Economy, and Biomechanics","Running participation continues to increase. The ideal strike pattern during running is a controversial topic. Many coaches and therapists promote non-rearfoot strike (NRFS) running with a belief that it can treat and prevent injury, and improve running economy. The aims of this review were to synthesise the evidence comparing NRFS with rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns in relation to injury and running economy (primary aim), and biomechanics (secondary aim). Systematic review and meta-analysis. Consideration was given to within participant, between participant, retrospective, and prospective study designs. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus. Fifty-three studies were included. Limited evidence indicated that NRFS running is retrospectively associated with lower reported rates of mild (standard mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 3.25, 2.37–4.12), moderate (3.65, 2.71–4.59) and severe (0.93, 0.32–1.55) repetitive stress injury. Studies prospectively comparing injury risk between strike patterns are lacking. Limited evidence indicated that running economy did not differ between habitual RFS and habitual NRFS runners at slow (10.8–11.0 km/h), moderate (12.6–13.5 km/h), and fast (14.0–15.0 km/h) speeds, and was reduced in the immediate term when an NRFS-running pattern was imposed on habitual RFS runners at slow (10.8 km/h; SMD = − 1.67, − 2.8 to − 0.52) and moderate (12.6 km/h; − 1.26, − 2.4 to − 0.10) speeds. Key biomechanical findings, consistently including both comparison between habitual strike patterns and following immediate transition from RFS to NRFS running, indicated that NRFS running was associated with lower average and peak vertical loading rate (limited-moderate evidence; SMDs = 0.72–2.15); lower knee flexion range of motion (moderate-strong evidence; SMDs = 0.76–0.88); reduced patellofemoral joint stress (limited evidence; SMDs = 0.63–0.68); and greater peak internal ankle plantar flexor moment (limited evidence; SMDs = 0.73–1.33). The relationship between strike pattern and injury risk could not be determined, as current evidence is limited to retrospective findings. Considering the lack of evidence to support any improvements in running economy, combined with the associated shift in loading profile (i.e., greater ankle and plantarflexor loading) found in this review, changing strike pattern cannot be recommended for an uninjured RFS runner.

2020,6,12,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W3000012223,Atomic layer deposition for improved lithiophilicity and solid electrolyte interface stability during lithium plating,"Abstract Uneven deposition and stripping of Lithium (Li) can lead to dendrite growth and instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which severely prevents the Li metal battery from practical applications. In this paper, atomic layer deposition (ALD) method is used to alter the lithiophilicity of carbon fiber network by depositing ultra-thin conformal ZnO layer at a low mass loading (5.9 ​wt%). The thin layer ZnO by ALD could provide uniform Li nucleation sites and guide Li deposition along the carbon fibers without formation of dendrites, and release Li from top of the electrode without formation of dead Li during dissolution. As a result, the ALD ZnO-modified carbon fiber/Li (ALD/C–Li) composite anode can cycle stably at a large current density as high as 15 ​mA/cm2 giving low overpotential (105 ​mV) and long-running lifespan with stable stripping/plating profiles nearly 50 cycles at 5 ​mA/cm2. Tests of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with argon ion etching show that the ALD/C–Li anode can effectively stabilize the SEI with a negligible increase in thickness after 100th cycle, while that of bare Li electrode doubles under the same cycling conditions. The full cell with LiFePO4 cathode also shows a much low hysteresis at 2 ​C over 30 cycles. The strategy developed in this work provides a novel alternative to Li anodes with long lifespan and opens up a new avenue for Li metal batteries with high energy density and high power density.",2020-06-01,Energy Storage Materials,https://openalex.org/V2764728150,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2020.01.019,17,26,28,,0,27,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000012223,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2020.01.019,journal-article,3000012223

It is not feasible to identify patients at risk of antibody formation before initiating infliximab. The genetic variation HLADQA1*05 (rs2097432) has been linked to infliximab antibody formation in Crohn's disease (CD). AIMS To evaluate the association between HLADQA1*05 and infliximab antibody formation, infliximab loss of response, treatment discontinuation and adverse drug events in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, infliximab-exposed patients with IBD (n = 262) were screened for the genetic variation, HLADQA1*05A>G (rs2097432). Risk of infliximab ADA formation, infliximab loss of response, adverse events and discontinuation were assessed in wild-type (GG) and variant-carrying (AG or AA) individuals. RESULTS Forty per cent of all participants were HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers, with 79% of participants with infliximab antibodies carrying at least one variant allele. The risk of infliximab antibody formation was higher in HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers (adjusted HR = 7.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.97-17.191, P = 1.46 × 10-5 ) independent of age, sex, weight, dose and co-immunosuppression with an immunomodulator. Variant carrier status was associated with an increased risk of infliximab loss of response (adjusted HR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.41-3.88, P = .001) and discontinuation (adjusted HR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.46-3.43, P = 2.53 × 10-4 ) although not with infliximab-associated adverse drug events.

In actual engineering, pile surrounding soil may be strengthened or weakened due to different pile installation methods, which is regarded as pile installation effect. At the same time, soil plug effect which describes the interaction between the soil plug and pile wall is also non-negligible in bearing analysis. Along the model of inhomogeneous medium, this paper subdivides the inhomogeneous soil region into certain sub-zones whose shear complex stiffness are derived by virtue of continuity conditions and plain strain model. To study the influence of soil plug effect, the additional mass model is raised and utilized in this paper. In this model, the pile-soil plug system is vertically split into infinite sections, and each pipe pile section and soil plug section is connected by distributed Voigt model. The analytical solution of torsional complex impedance is acquired and compared with results obtained from former studies to verify its rationality.

CT TAC was quantified as the sum of airways in the segmented airway tree, and airway wall area percent (WA%) and lumen area were measured. MRI ventilation abnormalities were quantified as the ventilation defect percent.Measurements and Main Results: We evaluated 70 participants, including 1 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) steps 1 to 3, 1 GINA 4, and 3 GINA 5 participants with asthma. As compared with GINA 1 to 3, TAC was significantly diminished in GINA  (P = 0.03) and GINA  (P = 0.045). Terminal airway intraluminal occlusion was present in  (2 GINA  and  GINA 5) of 70 participants. Sub-subsegmental airways were CT-invisible or missing in  out of 70 participants; the most common number of missing sub-subsegments was 10. Participants with ≥10 missing subsegments had worse WA% (P < 0.0001), lumen area (P < 0.0001), and ventilation defect percent (P = 0.03) than those with <1 missing subsegments. In a multivariable model, TAC (standardized regression coefficient = 0.50; P = 0.001) independently predicted FEV1 (R2 = 0.27; P = 0.003) and, in a separate model, TAC (standardized regression coefficient = -0.53; P < 0.0001) independently predicted airway WA% (R2 = 0.32; P = 0.0001).Conclusions: TAC was significantly diminished in participants with greater asthma severity and was related to airway wall thickness and ventilation defects.

Our objective was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on AI for primary care. METHODS We performed a scoping review, searching 1 published or gray literature databases with terms pertaining to AI (eg, machine learning, bayes* network) and primary care (eg, general pract*, nurse). We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by  attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS Of 5,515 unique documents, 40 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%).

Nonetheless, opioid-induced endocrinopathies still remain underdiagnosed, mainly because of symptom under-reporting by patients and poor clinician awareness. Hypogonadism is the most well recognised consequence of opioid use, but the inhibitory effects of opioid drugs on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and their negative effects on bone health also require attention. Hyperprolactinaemia might be detected in opioid users, but clinically relevant thyroid dysfunction has not been identified. The effects of opioids on other hormones have not been clearly defined. Assessment of gonadal and adrenal function (particularly if high index of clinical suspicion of hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism) and evaluation of bone health are advised in people that use opiods. Discontinuation or reduction of opioid dose and appropriate hormone replacement are the management approaches that should be considered for hypogonadism and hypoadrenalism.

The AM network is a distributed brain network comprised largely by prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortical brain regions, which together facilitate AM. Autobiographical memories with high arousal and negatively valenced emotional states are thought to be retrieved more readily and re-experienced more vividly. This is critical in the case of trauma-related AMs, which are related to altered phenomenological experiences as well as aberrations to the underlying neural systems in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Critically, these alterations to the AM network have not been explored recently and have never been analyzed with consideration to the different processes of AM, them being retrieval and re-experiencing.We conducted a series of effect-size signed differential mapping meta-analyses across twenty-eight studies investigating the neural correlates of trauma-related AMs in participants with PTSD as compared with controls. Studies included either trauma-related scripts or trauma-related materials (i.e., sounds, images, pictures) implemented to evoke the recollection of a trauma-related memory.The meta-analyses revealed that control and PTSD participants displayed greater common brain activation of prefrontal medial and posteromedial cortices, respectively. Whereby the prefrontal medial cortices are suggested to facilitate retrieval monitoring, the posteromedial cortices are thought to enable the visual imagery processes of AM.Taken together, reduced common activation of prefrontal cortices may be interpreted as a bias toward greater re-experiencing, where the more salient elements of the traumatic memory are relived as opposed to retrieved in a controlled manner in PTSD.",2020-04-01,Depression and Anxiety,https://openalex.org/V192592622,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22977,321,345,37,4,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992638947,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22977,journal-article,2992638947

We synthesize insights from the organizational perspective of corruption and the integration-responsiveness paradigm to propose that integration-oriented strategies will weaken the positive relationship between corruption and the likelihood of exit at high levels of host market corruption. We develop and test hypotheses pertaining to the main effect of corruption on the likelihood of subsidiary exit, as well as the moderating impacts of a firm’s equity ownership strategy and its expatriate staffing strategy upon this relationship. We theorize that uncertainty operates as the mechanism that underpins the corruption-market exit relationship, and that an MNE’s strategic choices with respect to its subsidiary investments contribute to reducing this uncertainty. We find that an increase in the foreign-investing MNE’s equity ownership share negatively moderates the positive relationship between corruption and the likelihood that foreign subsidiaries established by developed market MNEs will exit host emerging markets when corruption is high. However, the marginal effects results do not support the expatriate staffing strategy hypothesis.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) is crucial for the diagnosis of patients with liver tumors, especially for the detection of benign tumors and malignant tumors. However, it suffers from high-risk, time-consuming, and expensive in current clinical diagnosis due to the use of the gadolinium-based contrast agent (CA) injection. If the CEMRI can be synthesized without CA injection, there is no doubt that it will greatly optimize the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a Tripartite Generative Adversarial Network (Tripartite-GAN) as a non-invasive, time-saving, and inexpensive clinical tool by synthesizing CEMRI to detect tumors without CA injection. Specifically, our innovative Tripartite-GAN combines three associated-networks (an attention-aware generator, a convolutional neural network-based discriminator, and a region-based convolutional neural network-based detector) for the first time, which achieves CEMRI synthesis and tumor detection promoting each other in an end-to-end framework. The generator facilitates detector for accurate tumor detection via synthesizing tumor-specific CEMRI. The detector promotes the generator for accurate CEMRI synthesis via the back-propagation. In order to synthesize CEMRI of equivalent clinical value to real CEMRI, the attention-aware generator expands the receptive field via hybrid convolution, and enhances feature representation and context learning of multi-class liver MRI via dual attention mechanism, and improves the performance of convergence of loss via residual learning. Moreover, the attention maps obtained from the generator newly added into the detector improve the performance of tumor detection. The discriminator promotes the generator to synthesize high-quality CEMRI via the adversarial learning strategy. This framework is tested on a large corpus of axial T1 FS Pre-Contrast MRI and axial T1 FS Delay MRI of 265 subjects. Experimental results and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that the Tripartite-GAN achieves high-quality CEMRI synthesis that peak signal-to-noise rate of 28.8 and accurate tumor detection that accuracy of 89.4%, which reveals that Tripartite-GAN can aid in the clinical diagnosis of liver tumors.",2020-04-22,Medical Image Analysis,https://openalex.org/V116571295,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101667,101667,101667,63,,0,24,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018177167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101667,journal-article,3018177167

Even though alcohol use is highly criminalized, people consume illicit alcohol, which tends to be predominantly homemade and often contains methanol. Consequently, thousands of individual poisonings and hundreds of deaths annually are attributable to methanol poisoning. From February 19, 202 through April 27, 2020, the 201 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic rapidly expanded in Iran, and has been associated with 90,481 confirmed cases and 571 confirmed deaths.

In Bangladesh, the government has initiated some climate change policies to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the last decade. However, the rate of emissions has been increasing recently, which questions the emissions reduction potential of these policies. Therefore, this study has utilized relevant indicators to evaluate the extent to which the policies are mitigating climate change, and of their synergy with national development goals. The findings indicate that the policies have limited impacts on energy decarbonization, energy demand management, and emissions sink improvement. Although policies on renewable energy, energy efficiency and demand management, and afforestation are aligned with national development goals, the policies on electricity generation from coal and forest biomass have little synergy with the goals. By quantitatively evaluating the effects of its climate change policies in enhancing socioeconomic, and environmental benefits, this study can assist Bangladesh’s policymakers to understand the impact of the policies on climate change mitigation and their level of integration with national development goals.

While it is clear that no animal model captures the full complexity of ASD in humans, genetic models are extremely useful for studying specific symptoms associated with ASD and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. In this review we summarize the behavioral paradigms used in rodents to model ASD symptoms as they are listed in the DSM-5. We then review existing genetic rodent models with disruptions in ASD candidate genes, and we map their phenotypes onto these behavioural paradigms.

Transport of CMC-S-nZVI to the monitoring wells, both downgradient and upgradient, resulted in a significant decrease in concentrations of aqueous-phase cVOCs. Short-term (0–17 days) total boron and chloride measurements indicated dilution and displacement in these wells. Importantly however, compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA), changes in concentrations of intermediates, and increase in ethene concentrations confirmed dechlorination of cVOCs. Dissolution from the DNAPL pool into the aqueous phase at the deepest levels (4.0–4.5 m bgs) was identifiable from the increased cVOCs concentrations during long-term monitoring. However, at the uppermost levels (∼1.5 m above the source zone) a contrasting trend was observed indicating successful dechlorination. Changes in cVOCs concentrations and CSIA data suggest both sequential hydrogenolysis as well as reductive β-elimination as the possible transformation mechanisms during the short-term abiotic and long-term biotic dechlorination. One of the most positive outcomes of this CMC-S-nZVI field treatment is the non-accumulation of lower chlorinated VOCs, particularly vinyl chloride.

IKT approaches are used to improve the relevance and impact of research. As an emerging field, however, the evidence underpinning IKT is in active development. The Integrated Knowledge Translation Research Network represents a collaborative interdisciplinary team that aims to advance the state of IKT science. Methods In 2017, the Integrated Knowledge Translation Research Network issued a call to its members for concept papers to further define IKT, outline an IKT research agenda, and inform the Integrated Knowledge Translation Research Network’s special meeting entitled, Integrated Knowledge Translation State of the Science Colloquium, in Ottawa, Canada (2018). At the colloquium, authors presented concept papers and discussed knowledge-gaps for a research agenda and implications for advancing the IKT field. We took detailed field notes, audio-recorded the meeting and analysed the data using qualitative content analysis. Results Twenty-four participants attended the meeting, including researchers ( n = 11), trainees ( n = 6) and knowledge users ( n = 7). Seven overarching categories emerged from these proceedings – IKT theory, IKT methods, IKT process, promoting partnership, definitions and distinctions of key IKT terms, capacity-building, and role of funders.

This may be linked to changes in the proportion of neuronal types across areas that influence circuits’ ability to generate recurrent excitation. We recorded neuronal activity from areas middle temporal (MT), medial superior temporal (MST), and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of monkeys performing a WM task and classified neurons as narrow (NS) and broad spiking (BS). The ratio NS/BS decreased from MT &amp;gt; MST &amp;gt; LPFC. We analyzed the Allen Institute database of ex vivo mice/human intracellular recordings to interpret our data. Our analysis suggests that NS neurons correspond to parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST) interneurons while BS neurons are pyramidal (P) cells or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons. We labeled neurons in monkey tissue sections of MT/MST and LPFC and found that the proportion of PV in cortical layers 2/3 decreased, while the proportion of CR cells increased from MT/MST to LPFC. Assuming that primate CR/CB/PV cells perform similar computations as mice VIP/SST/PV cells, our results suggest that changes in the proportion of CR and PV neurons in layers 2/3 cells may favor the emergence of activity encoding WM in association areas.",2020-06-30,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa056,4544,4562,30,8,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013010530,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa056,journal-article,3013010530

Despite significant overlap in structure and physiological function, skin and the oral mucosa exhibit significantly different healing profiles in response to injury. The oral mucosa has a propensity for rapid restoration of barrier function with minimal underlying fibrosis, but in contrast, skin is associated with slower healing and scar formation. Modulators of cell function, matricellular proteins have been shown to play significant roles in cutaneous healing, but their role in restoration of the oral mucosa is poorly defined. As will be discussed in this review, over the last 12 years our research group has been actively investigating the role of the profibrotic matricellular protein periostin in tissue homeostasis and fibrosis, as well as healing, in both skin and gingiva. In the skin, periostin is highly expressed in fibrotic scars and is upregulated during cutaneous wound repair, where it facilitates myofibroblast differentiation. In contrast, in gingival healing, periostin regulates extracellular matrix synthesis but does not appear to be associated with the transition of mesenchymal cells to a contractile phenotype. The significance of these findings will be discussed, with a focus on periostin as a potential therapeutic to augment healing of soft tissues or suppress fibrosis.",2020-06-01,American Journal of Physiology-cell Physiology,https://openalex.org/V62704344,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00035.2020,C1065,C1077,318,6,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014129195,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00035.2020,journal-article,3014129195

However, little is known about their efficacy compared with each other. This network meta-analysis (NMA) estimated the comparative efficacy of JAK inhibitors currently approved for RA. A targeted literature review was conducted for phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of three approved JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) as monotherapy or combination therapy among patients with moderate-to-severe RA who had inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD-IR). Using Bayesian NMA, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses and clinical remission (defined as DAS28-CRP < 2.6) were evaluated separately at 12 and 24 weeks. Eleven RCTs were identified and included in the NMA. All JAK inhibitors demonstrated significantly better efficacy than csDMARD. Among combination therapies, upadacitinib 15 mg had the highest 12-week ACR50 responses (median [95% credible interval]: 43.4% [33.4%, 54.5%]), followed by tofacitinib 5 mg (38.7% [28.6%, 49.8%]), baricitinib 2 mg (37.1% [25.0%, 50.6%]), and baricitinib 4 mg (36.7%, [27.2%, 47.0%]). Similar results were observed for ACR20/70 and at week 24. Upadacitinib 15 mg + csDMARD was also found to have the highest clinical remission rates at week 12 (29.8% [16.9%, 47.0%]), followed by tofacitinib 5 mg (24.3%, [12.7%, 40.2%]), baricitinib 4 mg (22.8%, [11.8%, 37.5%]), and baricitinib 2 mg (20.1%, [8.6%, 37.4%]). Similar results were seen at week 24. Among monotherapies, upadacitinib had a higher ACR50 response (38.5% [25.3%, 53.2%]) than tofacitinib (30.4% [18.3%, 45.5%]). The differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant between the JAK inhibitors.

To assess functional connectivity (FC) across the marmoset brain, resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is often performed under isoflurane anesthesia to avoid the effects of motion, physiological stress, and training requirements. In marmosets, however, it remains unclear how isoflurane anesthesia affects patterns of FC. Here, we investigated the effects of isoflurane on FC when delivered with either medical air or 100% pure oxygen, two canonical methods of inhalant isoflurane anesthesia delivery. The results demonstrated that when delivered with either medical air or 100% oxygen, isoflurane globally decreased FC across resting-state networks that were identified in awake marmosets. Generally, although isoflurane globally decreased FC in resting-state networks, the spatial structure of the networks was preserved. Outside of the context of RS networks, we indexed pair-wise functional connectivity between regions across the brain and found that isoflurane substantially altered interhemispheric and thalamic FC. Taken together, these findings indicate that RS-fMRI under isoflurane anesthesia is useful to evaluate the global structure of functional networks, but may obfuscate important nodes of some network components when compared to data acquired in fully awake marmosets.",2020-10-01,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa168,5943,5959,30,11,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036596508,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa168,journal-article,3036596508

Across two field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of employee co-creation activities in increasing employees’ positive CSR perceptions is moderated by self-construal (i.e., whether an individual views the self as relatively independent from or interdependent with others). In particular, the positive effect of co-creation on CSR perceptions emerges only for employees with a salient interdependent self-construal (either measured as an individual difference or experimentally manipulated). Moreover, the results demonstrate that increased positive CSR perceptions then predict increased CSR engagement and organizational engagement. The research thus highlights the need to consider self-construal when trying to utilize co-creation to predict CSR engagement and organizational engagement, via CSR perceptions.",2020-10-01,Journal of Business Ethics,https://openalex.org/V76633192,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-019-04138-3,331,350,166,2,1,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2921406444,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-019-04138-3,journal-article,2921406444

For validation, CBF was measured independently using the MRI perfusion method arterial spin labeling (ASL). Data were acquired at two sites and under two flow conditions (normocapnia and hypercapnia). Depth sensitivity was enhanced using time-resolved detection, which was demonstrated in a separate set of experiments using a tourniquet to temporally impede scalp blood flow. A strong correlation between CBF measurements from ASL and DCE-NIRS was observed (slope = 0.99 ± 0.08, y-intercept = -1.7 ± 7.4 mL/100 g/min, and R2 = 0.88). Mean difference between the two techniques was 1.9 mL/100 g/min (95% confidence interval ranged from -15 to 19 mL/100g/min and the mean ASL CBF was 75.4 mL/100 g/min).

These developments help in addressing some of the long-standing challenges associated with nZVI-based remediation treatments and are of great interest for in situ applications. Herein we report results from a field-scale project conducted at a contaminated site. Sulfidated nZVI (S-nZVI) was prepared on site by first synthesizing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized nZVI with sodium borohydride as a reductant and then sulfidating the nZVI suspension by adding sodium dithionite. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of CMC-S-nZVI, from synthesis barrels, confirms the presence of both discrete spherical nZVI-like particles (∼9 nm) as well as larger irregular structures (∼50 nm) comprising of iron sulfides. This CMC-S-nZVI suspension was gravity fed into a sandy material and monitored through multiple multi-level monitoring wells. Samples collected from upstream and downstream wells suggest very good radial and vertical iron distribution. TEM-EDS analysis from the recovered well samples also indicates the presence of both nZVI-like particles as well as the larger flake-like structures, similar to those found in the injected CMC-S-nZVI suspension.

Assessment of performance status may differ between different healthcare professionals (HCPs), which could have implications in predicting prognosis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to update a prior systematic review with recent articles, as well as conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively compare performance status scores. A literature search was carried out in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from the earliest date until the first week of August 2019. Studies were included if they reported on (1) Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, and/or Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) and (2) assessment of performance status by multiple HCPs for the same patient sets. The concordance statistics (Kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha, Kendall correlation, Spearman rank correlation, Pearson correlation) were extracted into a summary table for narrative review, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each study and meta-analyzed with a random effects analysis model. Analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 3) by Biostat. Fourteen articles were included, with a cumulative sample size of 2808 patients.

Four studies compared different tools head-to-head; KPS was favored in three studies. The quality of evidence was moderate, as determined by the GRADE tool. The meta-analysis’s Pearson correlation coefficient ranged from 0.705 to 0.787; there is notable correlation of performance status scores, with no one tool statistically superior to others.

To reduce safety factors in dimensioning SMC parts, the influence of processing parameters and stochastic variation of microstructural and physical properties needs to be quantified accurately. Taking into account the inherent three-scale structure of SMC, we improve the microstructure generator of Chen et al. [Compos. Struct. 188, pp. 25–38, 2018] in various respects. Firstly, we consistently rely upon state-of-the-art closure approximations for the fourth order fiber orientation tensor. More precisely, we show that for a planar fiber orientation state, there is an explicit formula for the fast exact closure approximation of Montgomery-Smith et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 680, pp. 321–335, 2011]. Secondly, we exploit the use of quasi-random numbers in sampling the fiber orientation distribution, leading to dramatic improvements in accuracy compared to pseudo-random Monte Carlo sampling. Last but not least, we rely upon fast Fourier transform based methods for rapid computational homogenization. With these methodological improvements at hand, we thoroughly investigate the influence of the mechanical and microstructural parameters on the effective elastic properties of SMC composites, and compare the results to direct numerical simulations on large scale digital volume images and mean-field estimates.",2020-03-01,Computational Materials Science,https://openalex.org/V26018076,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109456,109456,109456,174,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001016366,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109456,journal-article,3001016366

The diverse pathways regulated by AKT1 are communicated in the cell via the phosphorylation of perhaps more than 10 cellular substrates. AKT1 is itself activated by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473. Despite the fact that these phosphorylation sites are biomarkers for cancers and tumor biology, their individual roles in shaping AKT1 substrate selectivity are unknown. We recently developed a method to produce AKT1 with programmed phosphorylation at either or both of its key regulatory sites. Here, we used both defined and randomized peptide libraries to map the substrate selectivity of site-specific, singly and doubly phosphorylated AKT1 variants. To globally quantitate AKT1 substrate preferences, we synthesized three AKT1 substrate peptide libraries: one based on 8 substrates and two independent and larger oriented peptide array libraries (OPALs) of ∼1011 peptides each. We found that each phospho-form of AKT1 has common and distinct substrate requirements. Compared with pAKT1T308, the addition of Ser-473 phosphorylation increased AKT1 activities on some, but not all of its substrates. This is the first report that Ser-473 phosphorylation can positively or negatively regulate kinase activity in a substrate-dependent fashion. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the OPAL-activity data effectively discriminate known AKT1 substrates from closely related kinase substrates.

It is important to know what a given total score or a change score from baseline on one scale means in relation to the other scale. Methods We obtained individual participant data from the randomised controlled trials of psychological and pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorders. We then identified corresponding scores of the HAMD and the BDI (36 patients from seven trials) or the BDI-II (68 patients from another seven trials) using the equipercentile linking method. Results The HAMD total scores of 10, 2 and 3 corresponded approximately with the BDI scores of 10, 2 and 4 or with the BDI-II scores of 13, 3 and 50. The HAMD change scores of −2 and −1 with the BDI of −2 and −1 and with the BDI-II of −3 and −16. Conclusions The results can help clinicians interpret the HAMD or BDI scores of their patients in a more versatile manner and also help clinicians and researchers evaluate such scores reported in the literature or the database, when scores on only one of these scales are provided.

The annual procedural rate, as a proportion of all reported cases, increased significantly from 2006 (0.3%) to 201 (1.6%; p < 0.001), along with a significant increase in average patient age (44.3 ± 15. to 48.4 ± 14.5; p < 0.001). Specifically focusing on the meniscectomy cohort, average patient age significantly increased from 47.9 ± 15. to 50.7 ± 13.5 (p = 0.001). The overall incidence of complications was 2.0% (n = 1333), with major complications in 0.9% (n = 639) and minor complications in 1.0% (n = 701).

Nanoindentation was conducted on ten grains at room temperature before and after ion irradiation (0.3 dpa, 250 °C). The hardness decreases as the declination angle (the angle between c-axis and sample surface normal) increases, both before and after irradiation. However, the irradiation induced maximum absolute and relative increment of hardness occur when the declination angle is about 55° and 60°, respectively. The hardness increment was found to be proportional to the relative activation of the type slip with increase of declination angle, at low angles. However for angles higher than 55–60° the hardness increment was found to be reduced by the activation of deformation twinning and cross slip. A peak increment of irradiation hardening is therefore observed due to the orientation-dependent combination of different deformation mechanisms. CRSS values of all slip systems and for {10–12} tension twinning before and after irradiation were obtained by fitting to a crystal plasticity finite element model (CPFEM). The obstacle strength of heavy ion induced type dislocation loops generated at 250 °C on subsequent room temperature slip was thus calculated to be approximately 0.29 ± 0.05.",2020-01-01,International Journal of Plasticity,https://openalex.org/V10186584,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijplas.2019.08.007,133,154,124,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2967949074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijplas.2019.08.007,journal-article,2967949074

Therefore, it is critical to explore factors that may safeguard women's positive body image. A recent study by Homan and Tylka (2015) found that in a large sample (N = 263) of female MTurk workers and university-aged women, both appearance-contingent self-worth and body-based social comparisons were linked to less positive body image, but these links were attenuated in the face of high self-compassion. This research, an independent direct replication of the original study, supported the original findings. In a new, larger sample (N = 363 female-identified MTurk workers), signals were detected that were similar in size and magnitude to the original study. Specifically, while appearance-contingent self-worth and body-based social comparisons were negatively linked to body appreciation, those who endorsed higher levels of self-compassion reported a more positive body image, even in the presence of these potential threats.

Tailored online IPV interventions that account for differences among women have potential to reduce barriers to support and improve key outcomes. Methods Double blind randomized controlled trial of 46 Canadian adult women who experienced recent IPV randomly were assigned to receive either a tailored , interactive online safety and health intervention ( iCAN Plan 4 Safety ) or a static, non-tailored version of this tool. Primary (depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms) and secondary (helpfulness of safety actions, confidence in safety planning, mastery, social support, experiences of coercive control, and decisional conflict) outcomes were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 1 months later via online surveys. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to test for differences in outcomes by study arm. Differential effects of the tailored intervention for 4 strata of women were examined using effect sizes. Exit survey process evaluation data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests and conventional content analysis. Results Women in both tailored and non-tailored groups improved over time on primary outcomes of depression ( p &lt; .001) and PTSD ( p &lt; .001) and on all secondary outcomes. Changes over time did not differ by study arm. Women in both groups reported high levels of benefit, safety and accessibility of the online interventions, with low risk of harm, although those completing the tailored intervention were more positive about fit and helpfulness. Importantly, the tailored intervention had greater positive effects for 4 groups of women, those: with children under 1 living at home; reporting more severe violence; living in medium-sized and large urban centers; and not living with a partner. Conclusion This trial extends evidence about the effectiveness of online safety and health interventions for women experiencing IPV to Canadian women and provides a contextualized understanding about intervention processes and effects useful for future refinement and scale up. The differential effects of the tailored intervention found for specific subgroups support the importance of attending to diverse contexts and needs. iCAN is a promising intervention that can complement resources available to Canadian women experiencing IPV.

PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their receptor N terminus by enzymes such as thrombin, trypsin, and cathepsin-G. This reveals the receptor-activating motif, termed the tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the receptor and triggers signaling. However, PARs are also activated by exogenous application of synthetic peptides derived from the tethered-ligand sequence. To better understand the molecular basis for PAR4-dependent signaling, we examined PAR4-signaling responses to a peptide library derived from the canonical PAR4-agonist peptide, AYPGKF-NH2, and we monitored activation of the Gαq/11-coupled calcium-signaling pathway, β-arrestin recruitment, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. We identified peptides that are poor activators of PAR4-dependent calcium signaling but were fully competent in recruiting β-arrestin-1 and -2. Peptides that were unable to stimulate PAR4-dependent calcium signaling could not trigger MAPK activation. Using in silico docking and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Asp230 in the extracellular loop-2 as being critical for PAR4 activation by both agonist peptide and the tethered ligand. Probing the consequence of biased signaling on platelet activation, we found that a peptide that cannot activate calcium signaling fails to cause platelet aggregation, whereas a peptide that is able to stimulate calcium signaling and is more potent for β-arrestin recruitment triggered greater levels of platelet aggregation compared with the canonical PAR4 agonist peptide.

The HHV of crude oil was within the range of 26–30 MJ/kg. The results indicated that the beneficial effect of ethanol on the bio-crude oil yield might be compromised by adding Na2CO3 or NaOH into the liquefaction system under investigated reaction conditions. As suggested by GPC analysis, the bio-crude oil obtained in ethanol/water co-solvents from both non-catalytic and catalytic liquefaction contained a slightly higher molecular weight than that obtained in pure water.

Meta-analyses were used to evaluate effect sizes of instructed downregulation strategies on common autonomic (electrodermal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and pupillometric) and electromyographic (corrugator activity, emotion-modulated startle) measures. Moderator analyses were conducted, with moderators including study design, emotion induction, control instruction and trial duration. We identified k = 7 studies each contributing multiple sub-samples and performed 2 meta-analyses for combinations of emotion regulation strategy and psychophysiological measure. Overall, results showed that effects of reappraisal and suppression on autonomic measures were highly inconsistent across studies with rather small mean effect sizes. Electromyography (startle and corrugator activity) showed medium effect sizes that were consistent across studies. Our findings highlight the diversity as well as the low level of standardization and comparability of research in this area. Significant moderation of effects by study design, trial duration, and control condition emphasizes the need for better standardization of methods.

There is a move away from family and towards the social inﬂuences of peer groups. Emotionally-driven behaviours may override adolescents’ higher cognitive functioning during this time. Especially vulnerable are youth who have been the victim of high-impact trauma or chronic abuse and neglect. Speciﬁcally, the posttraumatic stress symptomatology that is often associated with experiences of abuse and neglect may impair the ability of youth to cope during this developmental period. This is where intervention by community workers may be used to support teens with a history of maltreatment, as they develop from children to adolescents and, ﬁnally, to adults. Part of such intervention includes violence prevention in families and in teen dating relationships, as well as directly addressing posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. This critical developmental period of adolescence presents community workers with an opportunity to intervene and guide the development of these youth, building upon resiliency factors, such as areas of individual mastery and empowerment and participation within the community. Aboriginal youth with a history of maltreatment present a special case for community workers. These youth have been subjected to intense acculturation pressures that do not exist for other adolescent populations, which create unique problems during their transition to adulthood.

Cochlear implant failures were calculated based on manufacturer, type of failure, and overall failure rate. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. An electronic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases revealed 2 articles on the topic of cochlear device failure. Data on reimplantation and device failure rates were extracted from this literature review and analyzed.A total of 80 cochlear implantations were reviewed from three manufacturers. The institutional reimplantation rate was 2.9% compared to the pooled rate of 6.0% calculated from the literature review. Medical failures accounted for 0.5% of the overall failures, device failures accounted for 1.6%, and inconclusive failures account for 0.7%. Survival analysis revealed a significant difference among manufacturers. An improved device failure rate was noted in the adult population (0.8%) as compared to the pediatric population (2.8%).This 30-year review represents one of the longest series in the literature examining reimplantation, device failure, and medical failure rates.

Which methods best map onto intersectionality theory, with regard to their assumptions and the results they produce? Which methods are best positioned to provide information on health inequalities and direction for their remediation? One method, multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA), has been argued to provide statistical efficiency for high-dimensional intersectional analysis along with valid intersection-specific predictions and tests of interactions. However, the method has not been thoroughly tested in scenarios where ground truth is known. Method We perform a simulation analysis using plausible data generating scenarios where intersectional effects are present. We apply variants of MAIHDA and ordinary least squares regression to each, and we observe how the effects are reflected in the estimates that the methods produce. Results The first-order fixed effects estimated by MAIHDA can be interpreted neither as effects on mean outcome when interacting variables are set to zero (as in a correctly-specified linear regression model), nor as effects on mean outcome averaged over the individuals in the population (as in a misspecified linear regression model), but rather as effects on mean outcome averaged over an artificial population where all intersections are of equal size. Furthermore, the values of the random effects do not reflect advantage or disadvantage of different intersectional groups. Conclusions Because first-order fixed effects estimates are the reference point for interpreting random effects as intersectional effects in MAIHDA analyses, the random effects alone do not provide meaningful estimates of intersectional advantage or disadvantage. Rather, the fixed and random parts of the model must be combined for their estimates to be meaningful. We therefore advise caution when interpreting the results of MAIHDA in quantitative intersectional analyses.",2020-01-01,Social Science & Medicine,https://openalex.org/V106822843,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112500,112500,112500,245,,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969570442,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112500,journal-article,2969570442

In this study, we report the inactivation kinetics by peracetic and performic acids of a typical indicator, Escherichia coli and its corresponding antibiotic-resistant subpopulation, in secondary settled wastewater effluent. Performic acid always showed greater inactivation efficiency than peracetic acid, whether or not the indicator was Ampicillin-resistant. Observed inactivation data, fitted with an exposure-based inactivation model, predicted very well the inactivation profile of both total and ampicillin resistant Escherichia coli. Notably, the antibiotic resistance percentage decreased significantly in treated wastewater compared to untreated wastewater thus making the peracid-based disinfection processes beneficial in controlling antibiotic resistance in secondary settled wastewater. Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration values remained unchanged. Finally, antibiotic-resistant-specific inactivation kinetics were used to predict the disinfection efficiency in continuous-flow reactors under ideal and non-ideal hydraulics thus providing useful information for future design and operation of disinfection process in antibiotic-resistance controlling mode.",2020-02-01,Water Research,https://openalex.org/V52566953,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115227,115227,115227,169,,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982035419,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115227,journal-article,2982035419

The Chicxulub impact event, which has been linked to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction marking the beginning of the Cenozoic Era, is arguably the most significant singular geological event in the past 100 million years of Earth’s history. The Chicxulub impact occurred in a marine setting. How quickly the seawater re-entered the newly formed basin after the impact, and its effects of it on the cratering process, remain debated. Here, we show that the explosive interaction of seawater with impact melt led to molten fuel–coolant interaction (MFCI), analogous to what occurs during phreatomagmatic volcanic eruptions. This process fractured and dispersed the melt, which was subsequently deposited subaqueously to form a series of well-sorted deposits. These deposits bear little resemblance to the products of impacts in a continental setting and are not accounted for in current classification schemes for impactites. The similarities between these Chicxulub deposits and the Onaping Formation at the Sudbury impact structure, Canada, are striking, and suggest that MFCI and the production of volcaniclastic-like deposits is to be expected for large impacts in shallow marine settings.",2020-02-01,Geology,https://openalex.org/V56162041,Geological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46783.1,108,112,48,2,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990851820,https://doi.org/10.1130/g46783.1,journal-article,2990851820

A meaningful perspective on what culture means is often missing from these discussions, however. Without a theoretically grounded notion of culture, calls for culture change are challenging to interpret and to act upon. Objective In this cross-cutting edge paper, we explore how culture has been defined and theorised using three lenses: the organisational perspective; the identity perspective, and the practice perspective. We consider what each perspective might offer to medical education researchers. Results Each of these perspectives draws on a range of disciplinary influences, and none represents a singular theory of culture. Broadly, the organisational perspective directs our attention to the shared assumptions and values that bind individuals within an organisation. It tends to view culture through a strategic lens; culture may be either a barrier to or a facilitator of the changes that are inevitably required of an organisation if it is to maintain its relevance. The identity perspective, particularly the notion of figured worlds, alerts us to the power of communal narratives to shape how individuals see themselves within particular cultural worlds. The practice perspective emphasises what actually occurs in practice, avoiding symbolic ideas about culture and shared values and instead privileging activity and human-material networks or arrangements. Conclusions These diverse perspectives share a common thread- they shift our research gaze beyond the individual, allowing us instead to see how those individuals form organisations, inhabit cultural worlds and constitute practices. They afford substance and direction for explorations of culture, and thus offer the promise of a more nuanced understanding of some of medical education's most challenging problems.",2020-04-01,Medical Education,https://openalex.org/V54816476,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14037,289,295,54,4,0,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998319812,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14037,journal-article,2998319812

In the literature, the indirect effect has been largely missing in predator–prey models, until some recent works. Based on the recent work (Wang et al. in J Math Biol 73:1179–1204, 2016) where a fear effect is considered in an ODE model as a cost, in this paper, we also consider a benefit from the anti-predation response in addition to the cost, as well as a time delay in the transfer of biomass from the prey to the predator after predation. This results in a system of delay differential equations (DDEs). By analyzing this nonlinear DDE system, we obtain some insights on how the anti-predation response level (indirect effect) and the biomass transfer delay jointly affect the population dynamics; particularly we show how the nonlinearity in the predation term mediated by the fear effect affects the long term dynamics of the model system. We also perform some numerical computations and simulations to demonstrate our results.

Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for ""mental communication"" on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for ""yes"" and to stay relaxed for ""no."" The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions.

We find that the spectral and spatial distribution of the 13CH3OH masers differs from the CH3OH masers imaged at the same epoch, contrary to expectations from similarity of their pumping. This conclusively demonstrates that isotopic methanol masers are bright under different physical conditions and suggests that they can provide additional, complementary information to the CH3OH masers from the same source. We detect a rapid decay of the 13CH3OH maser lines suggesting that they are transient phenomena (masing for only a few months), likely associated with rapid changes in radiation field due to an accretion burst induced by massive disk fragmentation.

Looming stimuli strongly activated a network composed of portions of the pulvinar, superior colliculus, putamen, parietal, prefrontal and temporal cortical areas.

Recent literature suggests a shift in practice: Surgeons are becoming more comfortable with IBR in the setting of possible postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, despite the known complications. This study sought to investigate, at a population level, the patient and surgeon characteristics associated with the use of IBR and which of these factors were predictive of adjuvant radiotherapy. This retrospective population-based cohort study included all adult women who underwent mastectomy in the province of Ontario from 2007 to 2014. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) administrative data base was used to generate patient demographic and clinical data. The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) data base was used to elicit surgeon characteristics including clinical experience and volume of practice dedicated to breast surgery. Outcome variables included reconstruction concurrent with mastectomy, alloplastic vs autologous reconstruction, and use of radiation. A total of 25 861 patients underwent mastectomy and 297 had IBR (11.5%). The rate of IBR after mastectomy increased over time from 7.2% in 2007 to 17.2% in 2014 (P < .001). There was also an increase in the proportion of patients with IBR who received radiation over the time period, from 19.4% in 2007 to 28.2% in 2014 (P = .003). In the first regression analysis, IBR was associated with younger patient age, residing in closer proximity to cancer clinics, absence of malignant breast disease (ie, prophylactic mastectomy), having a younger surgeon performing the mastectomy, and receiving care at a teaching hospital. A second analysis showed that patient variables predictive of radiation after IBR were a younger age and a more advanced cancer stage and no variables specific to surgeon or institution were predictive of radiation in patients with IBR. A significant increase in the rate of IBR as well as the use of radiation occurred over the 7-year study period. Multiple patient and surgeon factors were associated with IBR. Variables associated with radiation in IBR were harder to predict.

2020,7,17,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2984666594,Context-dependent activation of SIRT3 is necessary for anchorage-independent survival and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells.,"Tumor cells must alter their antioxidant capacity for maximal metastatic potential. Yet the antioxidant adaptations required for ovarian cancer transcoelomic metastasis, which is the passive dissemination of cells in the peritoneal cavity, remain largely unexplored. Somewhat contradicting the need for oxidant scavenging are previous observations that expression of SIRT3, a nutrient stress sensor and regulator of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, is often suppressed in many primary tumors. We have discovered that this mitochondrial deacetylase is specifically upregulated in a context-dependent manner in cancer cells. SIRT3 activity and expression transiently increased following ovarian cancer cell detachment and in tumor cells derived from malignant ascites of high-grade serous adenocarcinoma patients. Mechanistically, SIRT3 prevents mitochondrial superoxide surges in detached cells by regulating the manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2). This mitochondrial stress response is under dual regulation by SIRT3. SIRT3 rapidly increases SOD2 activity as an early adaptation to cellular detachment, which is followed by SIRT3-dependent increases in SOD2 mRNA during sustained anchorage-independence. In addition, SIRT3 inhibits glycolytic capacity in anchorage-independent cells thereby contributing to metabolic changes in response to detachment. While manipulation of SIRT3 expression has few deleterious effects on cancer cells in attached conditions, SIRT3 upregulation and SIRT3-mediated oxidant scavenging are required for anoikis resistance in vitro following matrix detachment, and both SIRT3 and SOD2 are necessary for colonization of the peritoneal cavity in vivo.

Analyzing these climate variables in isolation without considering their interdependencies might result in severe underestimation of their combined effects. In addition, the assumption of linearity between temperature and precipitation does not represent the real physical processes that govern these climate variables. In this study, copula functions are used to describe the joint behaviour of temperature and precipitation across 15 ecozones of Canada at multiple temporal scales. The Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation is investigated using daily records to quantify changes in extreme precipitation with temperature increases. In addition, using historical records, dating back to 1910s, temporal changes in the dependence structure across southern Canada are analyzed using a non-stationary framework. Results show clear signs of accelerated warming and wetting over northern Canada while strong evidence of hot and dry conditions is found in the Prairie provinces. Analyses over seasonal and monthly scales indicate increases in warm-wet and hot-dry conditions in winter and summer, respectively. Non-stationary analyses reveal shifts towards warm and wet climate conditions for the majority of southern Canada. Considerable deviations from the theoretical CC scaling rate of 6.8% is observed for extreme precipitation over parts of Canada with super-CC scaling rates observed in northern Canada and sub-CC scaling rates in the majority of southern Canada.",2020-02-01,Theoretical and Applied Climatology,https://openalex.org/V202078656,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-03062-w,1543,1558,139,3-4,0,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995703142,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-03062-w,journal-article,2995703142

This study aimed to investigate the effect of diet-induced metabolic disturbances on white matter neuroinflammation and cognitive function in a transgenic (TG) Fischer 34 rat carrying a human β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene with Swedish and Indiana mutations (APP21 TG), a model of pre-AD and MCI. Methods TG and wildtype (WT) rats received either a HCD with 40% kJ from fat supplemented with 20% corn syrup drink or a standard diet for 1 weeks. Body weight, caloric intake, and blood pressure were measured repeatedly. End-point changes in glucose and lipid metabolism were also assessed. Open field task was used for assessment of activity; Morris water maze was used to assess spatial learning and memory. Cerebral white matter microglia and astrocytes, hippocampal neurons, and neuronal synapses were examined using immunohistochemistry. Results Rats maintained on the HCD developed significant obesity, visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia, but did not become hypertensive. Impaired glucose tolerance was observed only in WT rats on the HCD. Total microglia number, activated OX-6+ microglia, as well as GFAP+ astrocytes located predominantly in the white matter were greater in the APP21 TG rat model in comparison to WT rats. HCD-driven metabolic perturbations further exacerbated white matter microgliosis and microglia cell activation in the APP21 TG rats and led to detectable changes in spatial reference memory in the comorbid prodromal AD and metabolic syndrome group compared to WT control rats. Neuronal density in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus was not different between the experimental groups. Synaptic density in the CA1 and CA hippocampal subregions was lower in the TG rats compared to WT rats; however, there was no additional effect of the co-morbidity on this measure. Conclusions These results suggest that white matter neuroinflammation might be one of the possible processes of early interaction of metabolic syndrome with MCI and pre-AD and could be one of the early brain pathologies contributing to cognitive deficits observed in mild cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD cases.",2020-01-21,Journal of Neuroinflammation,https://openalex.org/V199572710,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-1698-7,,,17,1,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005810664,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-1698-7,journal-article,3005810664

In this work, a resistive-type core-shell tactile sensor was designed and fabricated via the coaxial ink writing of a continuous single core-shell fiber. Particularly, a facile tubular deposition modeling method was established, in which deionized (DI) water was selected as the core and first coextruded with the elastomeric shell and then scarified and replaced by injecting liquid metal (LM). To weave the continuous single core-shell fiber, tactile sensing nodes were formed easily and precisely to position-registered mechanical pressure stimuli. The resistive responses including sensitivity, coupling and reliability of the sensor architecture were examined, and the tracing mode was performed. Furthermore, the tactile sensor could be directly patterned on a 3D surface. The core-shell fiber-based tactile sensor design and its scalable manufacturing are significant for the advanced fabrication of 3D printed conformable electronics. • Facile tubular deposition modeling is developed by sacrificial coaxial writing of an elastomeric shell and a water core. • The resultant single tubular fiber is continuously woven and filled with a liquid metal to form a tactile sensor array. • The conformable patterning of the tactile sensor on a 3D surface is demonstrated.",2020-05-01,Materials & Design,https://openalex.org/V8792693,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108567,108567,108567,190,,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007121683,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108567,journal-article,3007121683

We aimed to investigate the predictive relationship between neutrophil-associated inflammatory proteins in peripheral blood and changes in memory and executive function over 1 year in patients with AD. Methods Participants with AD were identified from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were assayed by luminex immunofluorescence multiplex assay at baseline. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test an underlying neutrophil associated plasma inflammatory factor. Composite z -scores for memory and executive function were generated from multiple tests at baseline and at 1 year. A multiple linear regression model was used to investigate the association of the baseline inflammatory factor with changes in memory and executive function over 1 year. Results Among AD patients ( n = 109, age = 74.8 ± 8.1, 42% women, Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] = 23.6 ± 1.9), the neutrophil-related inflammatory proteins NGAL ( λ = 0.595, p &lt; .001), MPO ( λ = 0.575, p &lt; .001), IL-8 ( λ = 0.525, p &lt; .001), MIP-1β ( λ = 0.411, p = .008), and TNF ( λ = 0.475, p &lt; .001) were found to inform an underlying factor.

Endplate lesions can be detected on magnetic resonance (MR) images as various endplate defects, including focal, corner, and erosive defects. Yet, the clinical significance of such endplate defects remains unknown. PURPOSE To determine the prevalence and distribution patterns of lumbar vertebral endplate defects and their associations with back pain in a population-based sample. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. PATIENT SAMPLE Subjects were randomly selected from a typical community in Hangzhou Eastern China, regardless of back pain status. OUTCOME MEASURES Each subject underwent a structured interview and lumbar MR imaging. Back pain history, including today, over the past  weeks, 1 months, and lifetime, were acquired. Endplate defects, MCs, and disc degeneration were evaluated on MRIs. Age, gender and body mass index (kg/m2), as well as lifetime exposures, including smoking history, riding in motorized vehicles and associated vibration, and occupational physical demands were assessed. METHODS Descriptive statistics were used to depict prevalence and distribution patterns of endplate defects in the lumbar spine. Logistic regressions were used to examine associations of endplate defects with back pain. The research grant was obtained from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (115,000 USD), Key Platform Project of the Health Department of Zhejiang Province (14,000 USD), Technology Program of Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of Zhejiang Province (21,000 USD), and 201 Qianjiang Talent Program of Zhejiang Province (7,000 USD) toward this work. There is no conflict to disclose. RESULTS There were 47 subjects (53.3±14.4 years, range 20–88 years) studied. Endplate defects presented in 30 (63.0%) subjects and 84 (16.0%) endplates. The presence of endplate defects, but not MCs and disc degeneration, was associated with lifetime back pain (odds ratio=1.64, p=.026) in multivariate analyses.

What is not well understood is how virus-induced inflammation impacts fetal-placental growth and developmental trajectories, particularly when inflammation occurs in early pregnancy during nascent placental and embryo development. To address this issue, we simulated a systemic virus exposure in early pregnant rats (gestational day 8.5) by administering the viral dsRNA mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C). Maternal exposure to PolyI:C induced a potent antiviral response and hypoxia in the early pregnant uterus, containing the primordial placenta and embryo. Maternal PolyI:C exposure was associated with decreased expression of the maternally imprinted genes Mest, Sfrp2, and Dlk1, which encode proteins critical for placental growth. Exposure of pregnant dams to PolyI:C during early pregnancy reduced fetal growth trajectories throughout gestation, concomitant with smaller placentas, and altered placental structure at midgestation. No detectable changes in placental hemodynamics were observed, as determined by ultrasound biomicroscopy. An antiviral response was not evident in rat trophoblast stem (TS) cells following exposure to PolyI:C, or to certain PolyI:C-induced cytokines including IL-6. However, TS cells expressed high levels of type I IFNR subunits (Ifnar1 and Ifnar2) and responded to IFN-⍺ by increasing expression of IFN-stimulated genes and decreasing expression of genes associated with the TS stem state, including Mest IFN-⍺ also impaired the differentiation capacity of TS cells.

The coupling effects of crystallographic orientation and internal structural defects on the resulting load distribution at the onset of plasticity are investigated to clarify the anisotropic characteristics of material responses to crystallographic orientation. Homogenous defect nucleation is studied by correlating the indentation force-displacement curve with the instantaneous defect structure. In the absence of pre-existing defects, nanoindentation deformation is dominated by nucleation of Shockley partial dislocations regardless of crystal orientation. Various forms of dislocation propagation are observed different crystal orientations. The elastic-plastic transition point appears later for the [111]-oriented surface than the ones for [001]-, and [011]-oriented surfaces. The relation of hardening and dislocation density shows that conventional Taylor hardening captures the plasticity after a certain amount of indentation depth the presence of enough dislocation density. The crystal's sensitivity to the presence of internal structural faults is strongly dependent on the crystallographic orientation. Nanoindentation simulations the presence of sessile dislocation loops the structure show that the most significant reduction the pop-in load happens for the [111] oriented sample. Our simulations suggest that the indentation near a defect can lead to small, subcritical events that lead to a smoother in at the onset of plasticity. Since internal defects materials are nearly inevitable, a defect-based model can be useful to understand the stochastic pop- loads nanoindentation tests.",2020-04-01,Mechanics of Materials,https://openalex.org/V176710131,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2020.103311,103311,103311,143,,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999989801,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2020.103311,journal-article,2999989801

Despite cost and safety implications, there are few studies directly comparing these techniques and table choice remains largely surgeon preference. The purpose of this review was to compare the clinical outcomes and complication profiles of traction and standard table DAA for primary THA.The authors searched databases for relevant studies, screening in duplicate. Study quality was assessed using MINORS criteria or Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data pertaining to patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and complications were abstracted.Of 308 initial titles, 4 studies containing a total 26,353 patients were included and analysed. Mean operative time was 70.9 ± 21.2 minutes for standard table (n = 4402) and 100.1 ± 32.6 minutes for traction table (n = 3518). Mean estimated blood loss was 382.3 ± 246.4 mL for standard (n = 2992) and 531.7 ± 364.3 mL for traction table (n = 2675). Intra-operative fracture rate was 1.3% for standard table (n = 3940) and 1.7% for traction table (n = 8386). Complication rates including revisions, dislocations and peri-prosthetic fractures were qualitatively similar between traction and standard table studies.Standard table and traction table DAA have similar outcomes and complications. Both techniques offer the short-term advantages of DAA when compared to other THA approaches. However, the standard table technique may offer perioperative advantages including decreased blood loss, shorter operative time, and fewer intraoperative fractures. In the context of rising global healthcare costs and lack of access to specialised orthopaedic traction tables, this review at minimum confirms the short-term safety of standard table DAA THA and prompts the need for future studies to directly compare these techniques.",2020-01-29,Hip International,https://openalex.org/V176044460,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019900987,662,672,30,6,0,16,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004336672,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019900987,journal-article,3004336672

Critical care transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers diagnostic reliability, superior image quality, and an expanded diagnostic scope to transthoracic echocardiography. Despite its favorable attributes, TEE use in North American intensive care units (ICUs) remains relatively undescribed. In this article, we seek to characterize the feasibility, indications, and clinical impact of a critical care TEE program.Retrospective, observational study.Tertiary care, academic critical care program consisting of  hospitals in Ontario, Canada.Consecutive critical care TEE examinations on ICU patients performed between December 201 and December 2016.None.Consecutive critical care TEE studies on ICU patients from December 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016, were reviewed. The TEEs performed on cardiac surgery patients and those without reports were excluded. Examination details, including indications, complications, examination complexity (number of views, Doppler techniques), and clinical recommendations were aggregated and analyzed. Two hundred seventy-four TEE studies were performed by 3 operators. Common indications for TEE studies were hemodynamic instability (45.2%), assessment for infective endocarditis (22.2%), and cardiac arrest (20.1%). A change in patient management was proposed following 79.5% of TEE studies. Thirty-eight percent of TEE studies were performed during evening hours or on weekends. There were no mechanical complications.Our observational data support intensivist-performed TEE as being safe and therapeutically influential across a broad range of indications.

Background While there is evidence linking several factors to nurses' job satisfaction, gaps still exist in understanding the differences between factors affecting job satisfaction for nurses working in rural and urban settings. Design Systematic review with narrative summary. Data sources Six databases were used to identify original studies that discuss the factors associated with the nurse's job satisfaction between 1998-2018. Review methods Two authors independently reviewed each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklists. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to report and examine the study biases systematically. Results A total of 38 studies were selected for this review. Physical working environment and authority and freedom were the most frequently reported factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Several extrinsic, intrinsic, personal, and community factors were also found to be associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Urban studies tended to focus on extrinsic factors, whereas there was more balance between the two sets of factors in rural studies. Conclusion Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors play an essential role in nurses' job satisfaction. Future research should use more robust research methods and pay more attention to contrasting rural and urban contexts. Herzberg's theory can provide conceptual clarity when investigating the factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Impact This review discussed the factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction in rural and urban settings. The findings linked several extrinsic and intrinsic factors to nurses' job satisfaction.

However, their poor flowability is the biggest challenge in applications. Nanoparticles, as flow additives, could significantly improve flowability of Group C particles. In this project, powder flowability was measured using three different techniques: FT4 test (cohesion), Avalanche angle (AVA) and Angle of repose (AOR). After nanoparticle modification, Group C particles present much smaller values of cohesion, AVA and AOR, indicating better flowability. In addition, fluidization behaviors such as pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity were investigated.

Two traditional and commensal tasks, i.e., bi-ventricle segmentation and direct ventricle function index estimation, are always independently devoting to address ventricle quantification problem. However, because of inherent difficulties from the variable CMR imaging conditions, these two tasks are still open challenging. In this paper, we proposed a unified bi-ventricle quantification framework based on commensal correlation between the bi-ventricle segmentation and direct area estimation. Firstly, we proposed the area commensal correlation between the two traditional cardiac quantification tasks for the first time, and designed a novel deep commensal network (DCN) to join these two commensal tasks into a unified framework based on the proposed commensal correlation loss. Secondly, we proposed an differentiable area operator to model the proposed area commensal correlation and made the proposed model continuously differentiable. Thirdly, we proposed a high-efficiency and novel uncertainty estimation method through one-time inference based on cross-task output variability. And finally DCN achieved end-to-end optimization and fast convergence as well as uncertainty estimation with one-time inference. Experiments on the four open accessible short-axis CMR benchmark datasets (i.e., Sunnybrook, STACOM 2011, RVSC, and ACDC) showed that the proposed method achieves best bi-ventricle quantification accuracy and optimization performance.

We build upon this research by suggesting that pro-environmental consumption decisions are shaped not only by ecological dispositions, such as internal environmental locus of control, but also by perceptions of situational factors. Accordingly, we examine how perceptions of situational factors that impede vs. enable the enactment of sustainable behaviors mediate the relationship between pro-environmental dispositions and actions. To this end, two studies that use survey methodology were conducted. In Study 1, we examined the construct validity of our newly developed measures of subjective enabling and constraining factors, and in Study 2, we tested our theoretical framework. Our results show that consumers with higher levels of internal environmental locus of control are more (less) apt to perceive enabling (constraining) factors. The effects of such dispositions on behavior are partially mediated by situational constraints and enablers. These findings demonstrate that consumers’ pro-environmental agency doesn’t operate in a vacuum, but rather, first shapes perceptions of situational factors which, in turn, support or thwart pro-environmental behavior.",2020-03-10,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://openalex.org/V58516903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119394,119394,119394,249,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989657225,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119394,journal-article,2989657225

Following this, the resulting bio-crude oil was applied as the feedstock for the preparation of neat phenol formaldehyde (PF) resole and bio-phenol formaldehyde (BPF) resoles. The net PF resole was prepared by using the whole bio-crude oil, while, the phenolic extracts from the crude oil together with 50% of phenol were employed for the preparation of BPF resoles. The results displayed that although the BPF resole contained a higher free formaldehyde and less thermally stable than neat PF resole, a lower curing temperature was adopted for BPF resole compared to neat PF resole. By analyzing their physical properties, it was observed that the dry bonding strength of BPF resoles was higher than that of neat PF resole. Most importantly, the dry and wet strengths of BPF resole met the requirements for using as an adhesive for plywood bonding.

However, whether these functions are encompassed in the everyday work of CCs is currently unknown. Methods This constructivist grounded theory study elaborates the range of roles taken up by CCs and illuminates the processes through which these roles are actualised. Two investigators observed 27 CC meetings (>80 hours) across seven diverse postgraduate programmes at a single Canadian institution. Following each observation, a semi-structured interview was conducted with one CC member. Data collection and analysis unfolded iteratively. Results In this study, CCs did much more than make summative decisions about progression and entrustment; they identified a variety of problems that arose at the levels of both the individual learner and the programme, and leveraged their knowledge of assessment data to develop solutions. The problem-solving work of CCs was enabled by the in-depth data review, synthesis and analysis work that occurred before scheduled meetings, outside protected academic or administrative time. Although this work often appeared invisible to those outside the committee, the insights gleaned from data review provided committee members with essential information about how their programme of assessment was unfolding in practice. Conclusions Competence committees may be an untapped resource that can support assessment for learning, local evaluation of competency-based medical education (CBME) implementation and continuous quality improvement for programmes of assessment. However, the ability of CCs to engage in this work is fragile and is currently sustained by the willingness of faculty members to devote their time and energy to it.

Attractive faces were selected more often, a bias that may be sensitive to response outcomes and was reduced when the faces were inverted. Experiment 4 explored an entirely implicit measure of approach, with participants passively viewing single faces while standing on a force platform.

PXR and FXR regulate pathways that are impaired in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Decreases in PXR and FXR activity are documented in IBD; however reasons for this are unknown. We aimed to assess the effect of Crohn’s disease (CD) on the plasma bile acid composition in vivo and the resultant impact on PXR and FXR activation. A cross-sectional study evaluated the plasma concentrations of 1 bile acids in addition to 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βOHC), an in vivo probe of the PXR target-gene cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) and the FXR target-gene, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 in individuals with (n = 74) and without (n = 71) CD. An in vitro model was used to assess the impact of CD-specific changes in the plasma bile acid composition on PXR and FXR activation. Decreases in glycochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid were seen in CD with increases in glycodeoxycholic acid and glycocholic acid relative to the total plasma bile acid profile. In vitro , increasing concentrations of bile acids applied in the same ratio as seen in the study cohorts resulted in decreased activation of both PXR and FXR in the CD model.

Thus, the PGP pile shaft capacity is affected by the pile–cemented soil interface and the strength of the cemented soil formed around the pile. In this paper, a series of shear tests were conducted to investigate the frictional capacity of the precast concrete pile–cemented soil interface, and the strength of cemented soil and its effect on the interface frictional capacity. The test results show that the frictional capacity of precast pipe pile–cemented soil interface is largely dependent on the cemented soil strength, and the peak skin friction of the interface increases from 7.58 to 204 kPa with the cemented soil strength increasing from 65 to 1500 kPa. An adhesion factor is proposed to correlate the peak skin friction of the precast pipe pile–cemented soil interface and cemented soil strength. The adhesion factor is found to range from 0.11 to 0.14 corresponding to the range of cemented soil strength from 65 to 1500 kPa. It was also noted the failure at the pile–cemented soil interface is brittle. The scale effect also exists in the pile–cemented soil interface shear test, and the scale effect factor is 1.9 when the pile diameter decreases from 8 to 37 mm.

To evaluate this, we conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of living kidney donors in Alberta, Canada between 2002-2016, using linked healthcare administrative databases. We matched 60 donors to 2,414 healthy non-donors from the general population based on age, sex, year of cohort entry, urban residence and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before cohort entry (nephrectomy date for donors and randomly assigned date for non-donors). The primary outcome was the rate of eGFR change over time (median follow-up seven years; maximum 1 years). The median age of the cohort was 4 years, 64% women, and the baseline (pre-donation) eGFR was 10 mL/min/1.73 m2. Overall, from six weeks onwards, the eGFR increased by +0.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% confidence interval +0.21 to +0.48) in donors and significantly decreased by -0.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (-0.94 to -0.75) in the matched healthy non-donors. The change in eGFR between six weeks to two years, two to five years, and over five years among donors was +1.06, +0.64, and -0.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively. In contrast to the steady age-related decline in kidney function in non-donors, post-donation kidney function on average initially increased by  mL/min/1.73 m2 per year attributable to glomerular hyperfiltration, which began to plateau by five years post-donation.

The interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health Screener (ChYMH-S) is a brief screener that provides an initial assessment for early identification, triaging, and prioritization of services. This study assesses the psychometric properties of the ChYMH-S. Data from children aged 4–18 years across Ontario mental health agencies were obtained. The screener demonstrated strong inter-item reliability on all measured scales and good convergent validity with the Behaviour Assessment System for Children, with all hypothesized comparisons demonstrating positive, significant correlations.

A spectrum of behavioral abnormalities can be recapitulated in rodents by inducing MIA using the viral mimetic, PolyI:C. Many studies have focused on long-term changes in brain structure and behavioral outcomes in offspring following maternal PolyI:C exposure, but acute changes in prenatal development are not well-characterized. Using RNA-Sequencing, we profiled acute transcriptomic changes in rat conceptuses (decidua along with nascent embryo and placenta) after maternal PolyI:C exposure during early gestation, which enabled us to capture gene expression changes provoked by MIA inclusive to the embryonic milieu. We identified a robust increase in expression of genes related to antiviral inflammation following maternal PolyI:C exposure, and a corresponding decrease in transcripts associated with nervous system development. At mid-gestation, regions of the developing cortex were thicker in fetuses prenatally challenged with PolyI:C, with females displaying a thicker ventricular zone and males a thicker cortical mantle. Along these lines, neural precursor cells (NPCs) isolated from fetal brains prenatally challenged with PolyI:C exhibited a higher rate of self-renewal. Expression of Notch and the Notc ligand, delta-like ligand 1, which are both highly implicated in maintenance of NPCs and nervous system development, was increased following PolyI:C exposure. These results suggest that MIA elicits rapid gene expression changes within the conceptus, including repression of neurodevelopmental pathways, resulting in profound alterations in fetal brain development.",2020-06-09,Frontiers in Immunology,https://openalex.org/V2595292759,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01145,,,11,,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035489464,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01145,journal-article,3035489464

Instead, homelessness tends to be dynamic, with individuals cycling in and out of multiple periods of homelessness throughout their lives. Despite this recognition, and a wealth of research on the causes of homelessness, generally, there is a lack of scholarship on the pathways to multiple episodes of homelessness. In particular, the relationship between violent victimization and women's likelihood of being homeless multiple times is largely unexplored. Drawing on data collected from 269 structured interviews conducted with women using the services of homeless shelters and/or transitional housing in three U.S. and two U.K. cities, we use multivariate logistic regression to assess whether violent victimization increases women's likelihood of experiencing multiple episodes of homelessness. Our results show that adult victims of stranger-perpetrated physical assault are significantly more likely to be homeless on multiple occasions. In addition, those who experience multiple forms of victimization (e.g., physical and sexual abuse) in childhood, adulthood, and/or across the life course are significantly more likely to experience multiple episodes of homelessness.

However, local practitioners face many barriers that can undermine their capacity to adopt and sustain adaptation initiatives to reduce exposure and vulnerability and strengthen resilience to climate risks. Existing scholarship suggests that national governments play an important role in providing leadership and resources to support local adaptation policy development. However, less research attention has been devoted to investigating sub-national, regional government initiatives to support local adaptation policy and planning in federal states, despite their financial resources and constitutional responsibility to oversee municipalities.

However, patient scheduling is complex due to, among other aspects, the existence of multiple priority levels, the presence of multiple service requirements, and its stochastic nature. Patient appointment (allocation) scheduling refers to the assignment of specific appointment start times to a set of patients scheduled for a particular day while advance patient scheduling refers to the assignment of future appointment days to patients. These two problems have generally been addressed separately despite each being highly dependent on the form of the other. This paper develops a framework that incorporates stochastic service times into the advance scheduling problem as a first step towards bridging these two problems. In this way, we not only take into account the waiting time until the day of service but also the idle time/overtime of medical resources on the day of service. We first extend the current literature by providing theoretical and numerical results for the case with multi-class, multi-priority patients and deterministic service times. We then adapt the model to incorporate stochastic service times and perform a comprehensive numerical analysis on a number of scenarios, including a practical application. Results suggest that the advance scheduling policies based on deterministic service times cannot be easily improved upon by incorporating stochastic service times, a finding that has important implications for practice and future research on the combined problem.",2020-01-01,European Journal of Operational Research,https://openalex.org/V103321696,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.06.040,,,,,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2950925344,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.06.040,journal-article,2950925344

UV-radiation (254 nm) is frequently used in combination with hydrogen peroxide at the end of the advanced treatment train for simultaneous disinfection and degradation of trace organic contaminants. In this work, a comprehensive study on the direct UV photolysis of eleven organic compounds (including ten pharmaceuticals and N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)) was conducted at varying pH of 5–8 using a collimated beam apparatus. Molar extinction coefficient (e) and quantum yield (QY) values of different ionic forms (cationic, neutral and anionic) for eleven organic compounds were estimated in the tested pH range. Furthermore, direct UV photolysis at a full-scale UV photoreactor with 30 low-pressure UV lamps was performed at pH 6.2 and 7.8 by varying water flow rates (375–2700 L min−1) and UV fluences (400–4000 mJ cm−2). A process model was developed to determine the log reduction of the test compounds. The model combines a Lagrangian fluence model in the photoreactor with a pH-dependent photochemical kinetic model that ulilized the measured molar extinction coefficient and quantum yield values.

Objective : To determine whether filling a postoperative opioid prescription after low acuity urologic surgery is associated with new persistent opioid use. Design, setting, and participants : A retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Participants were adults who underwent their first vasectomy, transurethral prostatectomy, urethrotomy, circumcision, spermatocelectomy, or hydrocelectomy between 201 and 2016. We excluded men with prior opioid use, confounding concurrent procedures, prolonged hospitalization, or cancer. Intervention : Whether the patient filled a prescription for an opioid within  d of their surgery. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis : The primary outcome was evidence of at least two opioid prescriptions filled 9–15 mo after urologic surgery. The secondary outcome was admission for opioid overdose. Primary analysis was adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results and limitations We identified 9 08 men, most of whom underwent vasectomy (78%). A total of 3 17 (35%) men filled a prescription for an opioid after their procedure. The most common opioid prescribed was codeine (70%), and urologists were the primary prescribers (81%). Men who filled a postprocedure opioid prescription did not differ, for most of the 5 medical comorbidities or markers of healthcare utilization that we measured, from those who did not fill an opioid prescription. There was long-term opioid use in 144 (1.6%); men who had filled a postoperative opioid prescription had a significantly higher risk of long-term opioid use (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.6) and opioid overdose (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5–5.9). A limitation is that we could not determine the indication for long-term opioid prescriptions. Conclusions : Prescription of opioids after low acuity urology procedures is significantly associated with increased opioid use at 1 yr after surgery; efforts should be made to reduce postoperative opioids, especially for urologic procedures that do not typically require opioids. Patient summary : Filling an opioid prescription after minor urologic surgeries is associated with an increased risk of persistent long-term use of opioid medications and a higher risk of serious long-term complications such as hospital visits for an opioid overdose.’",2020-01-01,European Urology,https://openalex.org/V96871409,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2019.08.031,68,75,77,1,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2973483382,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2019.08.031,journal-article,2973483382

However, transitions from CIC to other less optimal strategies, such as indwelling catheters (IDCs) are common. In individuals with SCI who stopped CIC, we sought to determine how individual characteristics affect the bladder-related quality of life (QoL) and the reasons for CIC cessation. Methods The Neurogenic Bladder Research Group registry is an observational study, evaluating neurogenic bladder-related QoL after SCI. From 147 participants, those using IDC or urinary conduit were asked if they had ever performed CIC, for how long, and why they stopped CIC. Multivariable regression, among participants discontinuing CIC, established associations between demographics, injury characteristics, and SCI complications with bladder-related QoL. Results There were 17 participants who had discontinued CIC; 6 (38%) were paraplegic and 11 (63%) were male. The most common reasons for CIC cessation among all participants were inconvenience, urinary leakage, and too many urine infections. Paraplegic participants who discontinued CIC had higher mean age, better fine motor scores, and lower educational attainment and employment. Multivariable regression revealed years since SCI was associated with worse bladder symptoms (neurogenic bladder symptom score), ≥4 urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a year was associated with worse satisfaction and feelings about bladder symptoms (SCI-QoL difficulties), while tetraplegia was associated better satisfaction and feelings about bladder symptoms (SCI-QoL difficulties).

Insight into ontogeny is essential to understand the functional significance of trabecular bone structural variation observed in adults. The complex shape and loading of the human calcaneus provides a natural experiment to test the relationship between trabecular morphology and locomotor development. We investigated the relationship between calcaneal trabecular bone structure and predicted changes in loading related to development of gait and body size in growing children. We sampled three main trabecular regions of the calcanei using micro-computed tomography scans of 35 individuals aged between neonate to adult from the Norris Farms #36 site (1300 AD, USA) and from Cambridge (1200–1500 AD, UK). Trabecular properties were calculated in volumes of interest placed beneath the calcaneocuboid joint, plantar ligaments, and posterior talar facet. At birth, thin trabecular struts are arranged in a dense and relatively isotropic structure. Bone volume fraction strongly decreases in the first year of life, whereas anisotropy and mean trabecular thickness increase. Dorsal compressive trabecular bands appear around the onset of bipedal walking, although plantar tensile bands develop prior to predicted propulsive toe-off. Bone volume fraction and anisotropy increase until the age of 8, when gait has largely matured. Connectivity density gradually reduces, whereas trabeculae gradually thicken from birth until adulthood. This study demonstrates that three different regions of the calcaneus develop into distinct adult morphologies through varying developmental trajectories. These results are similar to previous reports of ontogeny in human long bones and are suggestive of a relationship between the mechanical environment and trabecular bone architecture in the human calcaneus during growth. However, controlled experiments combined with more detailed biomechanical models of gait maturation are necessary to establish skeletal markers linking growth to loading. This has the potential to be a novel source of information for understanding loading levels, activity patterns, and perhaps life history in the fossil record.",2020-03-01,Journal of Anatomy,https://openalex.org/V31465112,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13120,474,492,236,3,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983232372,https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13120,journal-article,2983232372

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of hydrolysis lignin was investigated in a drop-tube fixed bed reactor at different temperatures ranging between 400–800 °C using zeolite X as a catalyst for the production of phenolic chemicals. The yield of low molecular weight monomeric phenolics increased considerably while increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 40 °C to 45 °C, but decreased with further increasing the pyrolysis temperature. Zeolite X remarkably increased the yield of monomeric phenolic compounds in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of hydrolysis lignin at all temperatures (400–800 °C) compared to fast pyrolysis. No significant changes were observed in the catalyst properties (crystallinity and textural structure) during fast pyrolysis of lignin.

Its pharmacokinetic profile is known to be affected by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A metabolism, while it is also a substrate of the efflux transporters ATP-binding cassette (ABC)B1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP). In this study, we assessed the impact of interacting medication and pharmacogenetic variation to better explain apixaban concentration differences among 358 Caucasian AF patients. Genotyping (ABCG2, ABCB1, CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3) was performed by TaqMan assays, and apixaban quantified by mass spectrometry. The typical patient was on average 77.2 years old, 85.5 kg, and had a serum creatinine of 103.1 µmol/L. Concomitant amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent and moderate CYP3A/ABCB1 inhibitor, the impaired-function variant ABCG2 c.421C > A, and sex predicted higher apixaban concentrations when controlling for age, weight and serum creatinine (multivariate regression; R2 = 0.34).

In wild-type mice injected with melanoma cells, we show that the stem cell transcription factor Sox2 is expressed by tumor cells and induced in CAFs derived from synthetic fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were labeled postnatally with green fluorescent protein using mice expressing a tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase under the control of a fibroblast-specific promoter/enhancer. Conversely, fibroblast activation was impaired in mice with a fibroblast-specific deletion of cellular communication network 2 (Ccn2), associated with reduced expression of α-smooth muscle actin and Sox2. Multipotent Sox2-expressing skin-derived precursor (SKP) spheroids were cultured from murine back skin. Using lineage tracing and flow cytometry, approximately 40% of SKPs were found to be derived from type I collagen-lineage cells and acquired multipotency in culture. Inhibition of mechanotransduction pathways prevented myofibroblast differentiation of SKPs and expression of Ccn2. In SKPs deleted for Ccn2, differentiation into a myofibroblast, but not an adipocyte or neuronal phenotype, was also impaired. In human melanoma, CCN2 expression was associated with a profibrotic integrin alpha (ITGA) 11-expressing subset of CAFs that negatively associated with survival. These results suggest that synthetic dermal fibroblasts are plastic, and that CCN2 is required for the differentiation of dermal progenitor cells into a myofibroblast/CAF phenotype and is, therefore, a therapeutic target in melanoma.",2020-01-01,American Journal of Pathology,https://openalex.org/V145577119,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.09.006,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979770664,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2019.09.006,journal-article,2979770664

The influence of ovarian milieu,"Abstract Sex differences in visuospatial cognition have long been reported, with men being advantaged on the Mental Rotations Test (MRT). The data, however, are variable, and sensitive to design parameters. When men and women are compared directly, with women in different hormonal milieus combined, there seem to be sex differences. When women alone are studied, taking into account different ovarian steroid concentrations and treatments, MRT performance varies with these changes. Indeed, several reports describe better performance among women with reduced estrogens. To better understand whether the sex difference in MRT persists once hormonal status is considered, we recruited reproductive age adults designated male and female at birth (MAB, FAB), and administered the Vandenberg-Kuse (V/K) MRT—comparing performance among MAB (n = 169) and FAB (n = 219). For FAB combined, we found a sex difference with MAB performing better than FAB. However, when FAB were analyzed by current menstrual cycle phase (Early Follicular (EF), Periovulatory (PO), Midluteal (ML)) or by hormone therapy (transmasculine testosterone administration (TM+), oral contraceptive (OC) ingestion prior to (OC+) or after cognitive testing (OC-)), low-estradiol groups (EF, OC-, TM+) performed as strongly as MAB, and had better MRT than cycling FAB in high-estradiol menstrual cycle phases (PO, ML). On a verbal memory control task, neither a sex difference nor a low estrogen advantage was detected, although performance varied with hormonal milieu. Our findings support a dynamic model of spatial performance and suggest that both MAB and FAB perform strongly on MRT, contingent on hormonal status.",2020-05-01,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://openalex.org/V81924583,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104488,104488,104488,115,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2983928924,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104488,journal-article,2983928924

Deficits of PPI are a hallmark of schizophrenia and associated with several other psychiatric illnesses such as e.g. autism spectrum disorder, yet the mechanisms underlying PPI are still not fully understood. There is growing evidence contradicting the long-standing hypothesis that PPI is mediated by a short feed-forward midbrain circuitry including inhibitory cholinergic projections from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) to the startle pathway. Here, we employed a chemogenetic approach to explore the involvement of the PPTg in general, and cholinergic neurons specifically, in PPI. Activation of inhibitory DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) in the PPTg by systemic administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) disrupted PPI, confirming the involvement of the PPTg in PPI. In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of specifically cholinergic PPTg neurons had no effect on PPI, but inhibited morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in the same animals, showing that the DREADDs were effective in modulating behavior. These findings support a functional role of the PPTg and/or neighboring structures in PPI in accordance with previous lesion studies, but also provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that specifically cholinergic PPTg neurons are involved in mediating PPI, implicating rather non-cholinergic midbrain neurons.",2020-02-01,Progress in Neurobiology,https://openalex.org/V69289175,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2019.101734,101734,101734,185,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995293438,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2019.101734,journal-article,2995293438

Usually, the first 1 weeks following initiation of BI therapy represents the period when the greatest dose increases and glycaemic reductions occur. Effective glycaemic control combined with minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia is important to enable the achievement of glycaemic control in the longer term. However, substantial therapeutic inertia exists in clinical practice, both in initiation and up-titration of BI, owing to patient-, physician- and healthcare system-related barriers, including fear of hypoglycaemia and the perception of a burdensome regimen. The more prolonged duration of action, reduced glycaemic variability and lower risk of hypoglycaemia seen with second-generation versus first-generation BI analogues may help alleviate patients' and physicians' concerns and facilitate titration. In turn, optimal BI titration and subsequent metabolic benefits may help improve therapy adherence and self-management.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of single agent ICIs in these pre-defined subgroups. The electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant randomized trials. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were meta-analyzed using the generic inverse variance method. Nine studies were included. Compared with chemotherapy, the use of single agent ICIs in the second-line setting reduced the risk of death independent of PD-L1 expression (HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.9 and HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85 for patients with PD-L1-negative and -positive tumors, respectively).

The combined use of these long diffusion times with short diffusion times ( The results showed elevated diffusivities with OGSE relative to PGSE in the genu and splenium (but not the body) in both males and females, but the OGSE-PGSE difference was greater in the genu for males. Females showed positive correlations of OGSE-PGSE diffusivity difference with age across the CC, whereas there were no such age correlations in males. Simulations of radial diffusion demonstrated that for axon sizes in human brain both OGSE and PGSE diffusivities were dominated by extra-axonal water, but the OGSE-PGSE difference nonetheless increased with area-weighted outer-axon diameter. Therefore, the lack of OGSE-PGSE difference in the body is not entirely consistent with literature that suggests it is composed predominantly of axons with large diameter. The greater OGSE-PGSE difference in the genu of males could reflect larger axon diameters than females. The OGSE-PGSE difference correlation with age in females could reflect loss of smaller axons at older ages.

This is one of the first studies to compare an objective global positioning system (GPS) sensor and subjective self-report CM measures in an older clinical population. Methods Over 1 days, 5 people in Ontario, Canada with early to mid-stage PD (mean age = 67.5 ± 6.3 years; 4 men; 4 retired) wore a wireless inertial measurement unit with GPS (WIMU-GPS), and completed the Life Space Assessment and mobility diaries. We assessed the convergent validity, reliability and agreement on mobility outcomes using Spearman’s correlation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analyses, respectively. Results Convergent validity was attained by the WIMU-GPS for trip frequency (rs = .69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52–0.81) and duration outside (rs = .43, 95% CI = 0.18–0.62), but not for life space size (rs = .39, 95% CI = 0.14–0.60).

A system view of the interactions between various reservoir purposes (like for example, hydropower production and environmental impacts such as fish habitats, sediment flushing, and landslide stability) is a prerequisite to attain the full benefits from reservoir operations. System dynamics simulation is a well suited approach for dealing with complex time-varying systems and is widely used in water resources management and analyses of global change. This paper presents the development of a generic system dynamics simulation approach (SDSA) for the analyses of interactions between reservoir’s various functions. The implementation of SDSA includes two steps. First, the causal diagram of the reservoir system is used to map and analyze the main interactions among reservoir system’s different components, identify driving feedback relationships and use the system structure to obtain insights’ into system behavior. In the second step, the stock and flow diagraming is used to quantify those feedbacks and interactions by introducing a set of physical and empirical relationships required to simulate the model. The developed SDSA is applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir in China. Scenario based simulation analyses are performed with the SDSA model to increase the understanding of placing different priorities on the interactions between hydropower production and environmental impacts of reservoir operations. Results from model validation and sensitivity analyses suggest that the developed SDSA model is capable of simulating interactions among reservoir’s various functions, and the case study application demonstrates the utility of the model for capturing the main characteristics of reservoir system dynamic behavior.

Here, a more rigorous psychophysics paradigm was applied to assess sensory sensitivity and relate hypersensitivity to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. In addition, commonly used questionnaire measures of sensory sensitivity were collected to determine if self-reported measures accurately reflect behavioural measures of sensory sensitivity. In all, 90 typically developing participants completed a visual detection task, a questionnaire measure of sensory processing and a measure of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Visual sensitivity, measured both behaviourally and with questionnaires, is positively related to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Surprisingly, visual sensitivity as measured behaviourally and through self-report are unrelated. Furthermore, a regression analysis suggests that while restricted interests and repetitive behaviours can be predicted based on both behavioural and self-reported sensitivity, these two predictors account for different portions of the variance in restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Thus, while these results provide evidence supporting the contribution of sensory sensitivity to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours, these results also indicate that behavioural and questionnaire measures of sensory sensitivity are measuring two distinct constructs.

However, biotin biosynthesis has been overlooked for priority pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can be attributed to the lack of attenuation observed for biotin biosynthesis genes during transposon mutagenesis studies in mouse infection models6-9.

However, their use is associated with major immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions with a rate that ranges from 3% to 4% in the general population. The pathophysiology of sulfa-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions is not well understood, but accumulation of reactive metabolites (sulfamethoxazole [SMX] hydroxylamine [SMX-HA] and SMX N-nitrosamine [SMX-NO]) is thought to be a major factor. These reactive metabolites contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) known to cause cellular damage and induce cell death through apoptosis and necroptosis. ROS can also serve as danger signals, priming immune cells to mount an immunological reaction.

Peripheral blood monocytes and platelets were isolated from blood samples and analyzed for in vitro cytotoxicity, ROS and carbonyl protein formation, lipid peroxidation, and GSH (glutathione) content after challenge with SMX-HA. When challenged with SMX-HA, cells isolated from sulfa-HS patients exhibited significantly (P ≤ .05) higher cell death, ROS and carbonyl protein formation, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, there was a high correlation between cell death in PBMCs and ROS levels. There was also depletion of GSH and lower GSH/GSSG ratios in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from sulfa-HS patients. The amount of ROS formed was negatively correlated with intracellular GSH content. The data demonstrate a major role for oxidative stress in in vitro cytotoxicity of SMX reactive metabolites and indicate increased vulnerability of cells from sulfa-HS patients to the in vitro challenge.",2020-03-01,The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,https://openalex.org/V146237847,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1535,409,421,60,3,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985012075,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1535,journal-article,2985012075

Our findings highlight the complex linkages between agricultural development, environmental degradation, and rural livelihoods. Despite the associated increased returns-to-scale in agricultural productivity and enhanced speed in land preparation with tractor-based mechanization, the clearing of major trees on farmlands as a precondition for obtaining ploughing services encourages land degradation, including the depletion of vital naturally growing tree species—shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) and dawadawa (Parkia biglobosa)—that have critical food provisioning, cultural, and socioeconomic value. The drive towards extensification has further produced competitive forces that fuel the appropriation of previously inalienable communal lands and weakening of longstanding norms that mediate environmental resource conservation and use. This situation is poised to alter customary land governance and the basis on which women assert their rights to land-based resources including shea and dawadawa. Marginalized women are progressively shifting their livelihood strategies into environmentally unsustainable subsistence activities. This study demonstrates the adverse ecological, socioeconomic, and political impacts of agricultural mechanization when implemented in agrarian societies marked by widespread poverty and pervasive gender inequities. Given the growing centrality of tractors and trees to rural livelihoods, we recommend conservation agriculture for the simultaneous promotion of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation. Relevant social policies must also be implemented to ameliorate the adverse livelihood impacts of these agrarian reforms.",2020-07-15,Land Degradation & Development,https://openalex.org/V153614898,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3490,,,,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988446129,https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3490,journal-article,2988446129

In this work, 2-step, 3-step, 4-step, and 5-step kinetic mechanisms for bitumen combustion were developed. The kinetic parameters were optimized via inverse modelling (genetic algorithm) by coupling thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG), conducted at 5, 10, 20, and 40 °C min−1 under nitrogen and air atmospheres. A 3-step mechanism that includes competing pyrolysis and oxidation reactions was identified as the simplest mechanism able to appropriately simulate all TG experiments, thus avoiding the need for more complex mechanisms. A unique set of kinetic parameters was found by averaging all the parameters optimized at different heating rates and atmospheres, resulting in an average error of 6% when compared with experimental data. This is the first time that averaged optimized parameters were employed, providing similar results as optimizing against all experiments at once. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were used to calculate the heat of pyrolysis and oxidation, and showed that char oxidation provided the highest energy release, whereas bitumen and asphaltene oxidation represented a 30–110 times lower heat of reaction. This is the first time that thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry experiments were used to optimize kinetic parameters for bitumen combustion.",2020-03-15,Fuel,https://openalex.org/V164770093,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116704,116704,116704,264,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995724699,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116704,journal-article,2995724699

During the process of invasion, rhoptries secrete their contents to facilitate interaction with, and entry into, the host cell. Here, we report the crystal structure of the rhoptry protein Armadillo Repeats-Only (ARO) from the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (PfARO). The structure of PfARO comprises five tandem Armadillo-like (ARM) repeats, with adjacent ARM repeats stacked in a head-to-tail orientation resulting in PfARO adopting an elongated curved shape. Interestingly, the concave face of PfARO contains two distinct patches of highly conserved residues that appear to play an important role in protein-protein interaction. We functionally characterized the P. falciparum homolog of ARO interacting protein (PfAIP) and demonstrate that it localizes to the rhoptries. We show that conditional mislocalization of PfAIP leads to deficient red blood cell invasion. Guided by the structure, we identified mutations of PfARO that lead to mislocalization of PfAIP.

Methods All Ontario respondents to the 201 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH) were linked to health administrative databases at ICES (formerly known as the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences). Survey structured interview diagnoses were compared with health administrative data diagnoses obtained using a standardized algorithm. We used modified Poisson regression analyses to assess whether socio-demographic factors were associated with concordance between the two measures. Results Of the 415 Ontarians included in our sample, 20.4% had either a structured interview diagnosis (13.9%) or health administrative diagnosis (10.4%) of a mood or anxiety disorder. There was high discordance between measures, with only 19.4% agreement. Migrant status, age, employment, and income were associated with discordance between measures. Conclusions Our findings indicate that previous estimates of the 12-month prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in Ontario may be underestimating the true prevalence, and that population-based surveys and health administrative data may be capturing different groups of people.

Usage of antiscalants or pH adjustment can suppress scale formation on membranes without sacrificing overall recovery. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two different antiscalants (phosphonate-based and acrylic acid-based) and pH adjustment for the inhibition of scaling on polyamide RO membranes during the separation of microfiltration (MF) treated secondary effluent wastewater. Product recovery was targeted at 50%, increasing the residual concentration of scale forming ions by a factor of 2 in the feed. Substantial scale formation, dominated by calcium carbonate, was observed during the separation of the feed. In the presence of antiscalants, calcium carbonate scaling was successfully abated, while iron based scalants did not significantly decrease. Phosphonate-based antiscalants were found to be more effective in inhibiting calcium carbonate scaling as compared to acrylic acid-based antiscalants. As such, RO membranes treated with phosphonate-based antiscalants demonstrated lower permeate flux decline and less calcium scale deposition on membrane surfaces under the tested conditions. The addition of a strong acid to control scaling is a less expensive alternative to antiscalant addition. pH adjustment using sulfuric acid was effective for the inhibition of calcium carbonate scaling. However, acid addition resulted in corrosion of piping leading to considerable leaching of iron and copper into the feed. The presence of iron and copper adversely increased the scaling potential of the membranes.",2020-06-01,Separation and Purification Technology,https://openalex.org/V69753523,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116549,116549,116549,240,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998778326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116549,journal-article,2998778326

They experience no direct sunlight and reach temperatures as low as 3 K. PSRs are of interest as evidence suggests that some may contain water ice (H2O/OH‐), which could provide a record of the evolution of volatiles in the inner solar system. This water ice is also a critical resource for life‐support systems and rocket propellant. A better understanding of mechanical properties of PSR regolith, such as its bearing capacity, will help optimize the design of future exploration rovers and landers. Thirteen boulder tracks were identified on the edge of, or inside, south polar lunar PSR enhanced imagery and used to estimate the strength of the PSR regolith at latitudes of 70° to 76° in sites with maximum annual temperatures of 6 to 21 K. PSR boulder track features are similar to those observed in highland, mare, and pyroclastic regions of the Moon, implying similar properties of the regolith. Measured features were used to estimate bearing capacity for PSR regolith at depths of ~0.28 to 4.68 m. Estimated bearing capacity values suggest that these PSRs may be somewhat stronger than highland and mare regions at depths of 0.28 to 1.00 m. Bearing capacity in these PSRs is statistically the same as those in other regions of the Moon at depths of 1.00 to 2.00 m.

A systematic review with meta-analysis","The purpose of this systematic review was to critically appraise and synthesize the psychometric properties of the Global Rating of Change (GRoC) scales on the assessment of patients with low back pain (LBP), upper extremity and lower extremity disorders.A search was performed in  databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS) until February 2019. Eligible articles were appraised using Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist and the Quality Appraisal for Clinical Measurement Research Reports Evaluation Form.The  eligible studies included participants with orthopedic lumbar spine impairments (n = 52,767), patients with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (n = 1944), patients with low back pain (n = 183) and individuals with upper extremity disorders (n = 151). Risk of bias was ranging from ""adequate"" to ""very good"" and quality was found excellent for all studies. Based on pooled data, test-retest reliability of 11-item GRoC for patients with low back pain was found excellent ICC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.94. Test-retest reliability in patients with shoulder pain was found fair to good ICC of 0.6 in a 15-point GRoC scale. Seven studies (n = 7) examined the convergent validity between GRoC and another outcome measure. Minimum important change on the Portuguese version of Global Perceived Effect (GPE) for patients with LBP was 2.5 points out of 1 points.The current pool of clinical measurement studies indicates that the GRoC has excellent test-retest reliability for patients with low back pain, shoulder pain and with lumbar spine disorders. However, the validity of it as a reference standard in responsiveness studies or as an accurate overall assessment of change has been questioned. While future studies might provide more insight into its measurement properties, this limitation is unlikely to change. Therefore, we suggest that future responsiveness in the studies that want a global indicator measure need to use an additional measure to mitigate recall bias.CRD 42020149122.",2020-02-10,Journal of orthopaedics,https://openalex.org/V2764834445,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2020.01.047,40,48,21,,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005728586,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2020.01.047,journal-article,3005728586

The low temperature-induced effects are exacerbated when plants are exposed to low temperatures in the presence of high light irradiance but the experimental data on the impact of light intensity during cold stress and its influence during recovery from stress are rather limited. The main objective of this study was to re-examine the photosynthetic responses of A. thaliana plants to short term ( days) low temperature stress (12/10°C) under optimal (15 μmol m-2 s-1 ) and high light (50 μmol m-2 s-1 ) intensity and the subsequent recovery from the stress. Simultaneous measurements of the in vivo and in vitro functional performance of both photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), as well as, net photosynthesis, low temperature (7 K) chlorophyll fluorescence and immunoblot analysis of the relative abundance of PSII and PSI reaction center proteins were used to evaluate the role of light in the development of possible protective mechanisms during low temperature stress and the consequent recovery from exposure to low temperature and different light intensities. The results presented clearly suggest that Arabidopsis plants can employ a number of highly dynamic photoprotective strategies depending on the light intensity.

First, to take stock of the existing leadership succession research in these three related literatures – that examine the same essential phenomenon – but that have evolved separately. Previous reviews have focused mostly on CEO succession (not the broader phenomenon of leadership succession) mainly in publicly-traded firms; and to our knowledge no (recent) comprehensive literature reviews on the important topics of privately-owned and political organization leadership succession exist yet. Second, to develop an overarching integrative conceptual framework (ICF) that structures the overall leadership succession literature and shows the potential areas of integration and difference among the three literatures. Third, to develop three organizational frameworks – one for each organization type – that review what we know and what we should know about leadership succession in each type. Fourth, to critically compare the ICF, the three organizational frameworks, and the three literatures to better understand the similarities and differences among these literatures. By doing so and using a multidisciplinary approach we aim to contribute to the field in the following ways.

This study investigates the effects of these parameters on the energy consumption by individual rooms at a different location as part of a 100 m high-rise building, exposed to different weather conditions, having a different window-to-wall ratio. In the first part of the study, representative new-CHTC at the windward facade of the building is generated by using CFD simulations. In the second part of the study, comparative energy consumption assessment is carried out using the newly generated CHTC and other commonly used correlations by using EnergyPlus. The result shows that for high-rise building with 100% WWR exposed to a windy microclimate (such as Boston, MA), a deviation of 11.2% and 4.7% on annual heating and cooling energy consumption, respectively, have been observed. Further, the energy consumption of each room throughout the building height was also investigated to investigate the effect of building height. Compared to a room located at the mid-height (15th floor), the annual heating consumption on a room located at the 5th floor room was 7.8% lower and a room located on the 25th floor room the consumption was 7.6% higher. In summary, this study highlights the importance of accurate local CHTC generation to enhance thermal comfort in individual rooms and to optimize overall building energy consumption.",2020-02-01,Building Simulation,https://openalex.org/V153850590,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-019-0568-7,127,139,13,1,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2971267126,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-019-0568-7,journal-article,2971267126

When activated, the domain promotes the hydrolysis of RhoA-GTP, leading to reduced cell migration. DLC1 is kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between its RhoGAP domain and the DLC1 sterile α motif (SAM) domain. We have shown previously that this autoinhibited state of DLC1 may be alleviated by tensin-3 (TNS3) or PTEN. We show here that the TNS3/PTEN-DLC1 interactions are mediated by the C2 domains of the former and the SAM domain of the latter. Intriguingly, the DLC1 SAM domain was capable of binding to specific peptide motifs within the C2 domains. Indeed, peptides containing the binding motifs were highly effective in blocking the C2-SAM domain-domain interaction. Importantly, when fused to the tat protein-transduction sequence and subsequently introduced into cells, the C2 peptides potently promoted the RhoGAP function in DLC1, leading to decreased RhoA activation and reduced tumor cell growth in soft agar and migration in response to growth factor stimulation. To facilitate the development of the C2 peptides as potential therapeutic agents, we created a cyclic version of the TNS3 C2 domain-derived peptide and showed that this peptide readily entered the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and effectively inhibited their migration. Our work shows, for the first time, that the SAM domain is a peptide-binding module and establishes the framework on which to explore DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.",2020-01-10,Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://openalex.org/V140251998,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.011929,645,656,295,2,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2992552168,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.011929,journal-article,2992552168

Due to the highly evaluative and social nature of the sport context, girls’ emotional experiences around their body’s abilities, function, and fitness are important – yet understudied – predictors of sport participation. The objectives of this longitudinal study were to describe changes in fitness-related and appearance-related self-conscious emotions (i.e., guilt, shame, authentic pride, hubristic pride) and sport experiences (i.e., sport commitment, enjoyment, anxiety) over time, and examine whether between- and within-person differences in these emotions predict sport experiences during adolescence. A sample of 518 girls involved in organized sport completed questionnaires once a year over a three-year period. Results from multilevel models reveal detrimental changes in emotions, sport commitment and enjoyment over time. Further, fitness-related emotions remain significant predictors of sport experiences above and beyond appearance-related emotions thus highlighting the importance of fitness-related emotions in predicting sport experiences. Examining both between and within-person effects is novel in elucidating the predictive capacity of fitness-related emotions as they explain differences between girls – as well as variations in girls’ sport experiences over time.",2020-03-01,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,https://openalex.org/V131954271,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2019.101641,,,,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995281253,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2019.101641,journal-article,2995281253

An analytical model for calculating the horizontal load-displacement curve and the interlaminar deformability of the SCC is established, and pushover simulations are conducted to verify its efficacy. The developed model is then employed to investigate the critical factors that may affect the interlaminar deformability envelope of the SCC. To further demonstrate the feasibility of the SCC in upgrading the seismic performance of underground frame structures, the seismic responses of the same structure are analysed considering alternative column design, i.e., conventional rectangular or circular columns, or the SCC.

There is an extensive debate regarding the significant Ordovician tectonic setting of the W‐NCC. Most paleogeographic reconstructions emphasized the formation and rapid subsidence of an aulacogen along the HTB during the Middle–Late Ordovician, whereas paleomagnetic and geochronologic results suggested that the Alxa Terrane and the Ordos Block were independent blocks separated by the HTB. In this study, stratigraphic and geochronologic methods were used to constrain the Ordovician tectonic processes of the W‐NCC. Stratigraphic correlations show that the Early Ordovician strata comprise ~500‐m‐thick tidal flat and lagoon carbonate successions with a progressive eastward onlap, featuring a west‐deepening shallow‐water carbonate shelf. In contrast, the Late Ordovician strata are composed of ~3,000‐m‐thick abyssal turbidites in the west and ~400‐m‐thick shallow‐water carbonates in the east, defining an eastward‐tapering basin architecture. Early Ordovician detrital zircons with ages of ~2,800–1,700 Ma were derived from the Ordos Block; the Late Ordovician turbidites were sourced from the western Alxa Terrane, based on zircon ages clustered at ~1,000–900 Ma. The petrographic modal composition and zircon age distribution imply a provenance shift from a stable craton to a recycled orogen in the Middle Ordovician. These shifts define a tectonic conversion from a passive continental margin to a foreland basin at ~467 Ma, resulting in the eastward progradation of the turbidite wedge around the HTB, the eastward backstepping of the carbonate platform in the east and the eastward expansion of orogenic thrusting in the western Alxa Terrane. This tectono‐sedimentary shift coincided with the advancing subduction of the southern Paleo‐Asian Ocean beneath the Alxa Terrane, generating the western Alxa continental arc and the paired retro‐arc foredeep in the east under a compressional tectonic regime., Reconstruction model of the Ordovician tectono‐sedimentology evolution of the Northwestern Ordos Terrane. ]",2020-12-01,Basin Research,https://openalex.org/V36808561,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/bre.12435,1413,1440,32,6,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003682078,https://doi.org/10.1111/bre.12435,journal-article,3003682078

Healing progresses through the phases of hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, remodeling, and concomitant with re-epithelialization restores barrier function. Soft tissue healing is achieved through the spatiotemporal interplay of multiple different cell types including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells/pericytes, and keratinocytes. Expressed in most cell types, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) are signaling molecules associated with the regulation of several cellular processes involved in soft tissue wound healing and in response to cellular stress. A member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (MAPK), JNKs have been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory cell phenotype, as well as fibroblast, stem/progenitor cell, and epithelial cell biology. In this review, we discuss our understanding of JNKs in the regulation of cell behaviors related to tissue injury, pathology, and wound healing of soft tissues. Using models as diverse as Drosophila, mice, rats, as well as human tissues, research is now defining important, but sometimes conflicting roles for JNKs in the regulation of multiple molecular processes in multiple different cell types central to wound healing processes. In this review, we focus specifically on the role of JNKs in the regulation of cell behavior in the healing of skin, cornea, tendon, gingiva, and dental pulp tissues.

The mechanisms governing these firing behaviours are unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that the arterial baroreflex exerts varying control over the different AP subpopulations. During baseline, medium APs expressed the greatest baroreflex slopes, while small and large APs exhibited weaker slopes. On going from baseline to lower body negative pressure (LBNP; simulated orthostatic stress), baroreflex slopes for some clusters of medium APs expressed the greatest increase, while slopes for large APs also increased but to a lesser degree. A subpopulation of previously silent larger APs was recruited with LBNP but these APs expressed weak baroreflex slopes. The arterial baroreflex heterogeneously regulates sympathetic AP subpopulations, exerting its strongest effect over medium APs. Weak baroreflex mechanisms govern the recruitment of latent larger AP subpopulations during orthostatic stress. Abstract Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) occurs primarily in bursts of action potentials (AP) with subpopulations that differ in size and discharge probabilities. The mechanisms determining these discharge patterns remain unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that variations in AP discharge are due to subpopulation-specific baroreflex control. We employed multi-unit microneurography and a continuous wavelet analysis approach to extract sympathetic APs in 1 healthy individuals during baseline (BSL) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -40, -60, -80 mmHg). For each AP cluster, the baroreflex threshold slope was measured from the linear regression between AP probability (%) and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). During BSL, the baroreflex exerted non-uniform regulation over AP subpopulations: medium-sized AP clusters expressed the greatest slopes while clusters of small and large APs expressed weaker slopes. On going from BSL to LBNP, the baroreflex slopes for each AP subpopulation were modified differently. Baroreflex slopes (%/mmHg) for some medium APs (cluster 5: -4.4 ±  to -9.1 ± 5) expressed the greatest increase with LBNP, while slopes for large APs (cluster 9: -1.3 ±  to -2. ± 2) also increased, but to a lesser degree. Slopes for small APs present at BSL exhibited reductions with LBNP (cluster 2: -3.9 ±  to -2. ± 3). Larger previously silent AP clusters recruited with LBNP expressed weak baroreflex regulation (cluster 14: -0.9 ± 1%/mmHg). The baroreflex exerts the strongest control over medium-sized APs. Augmenting baroreflex gain and upward resetting of discrete AP subpopulations active at BSL, as well as recruiting larger previously silent APs with weak baroreflex control, facilitates elevated MSNA during orthostatic stress.",2020-05-01,The Journal of Physiology,https://openalex.org/V2090548,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279326,1881,1895,598,10,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008567013,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp279326,journal-article,3008567013

The aqueous phase has a low heating value and is considered a waste stream. In this study fractional condensation was employed to separate the liquid product of birch bark pyrolysis into an aqueous pyrolysis condensate (APC) and a dense biooil fraction. The APC contained high amounts (~100 g/kg) of acidic acid (AA) and was investigated for anaerobic digestion (AD). The AA in the APC could be converted to biogas, however, it contained elevated concentrations of microbial inhibitors (24 g/kg total phenolics). The inhibiting effect could be mitigated by acclimatization of the microbial population, which in turn converted some of the additional organics. The production of methane further improved with the addition of biochar to adsorb some of the inhibitors.

UWO 241 Exhibits High Cyclic Electron Flow and Rewired Metabolism under High Salinity,"The Antarctic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO 241 (UWO 241) is adapted to permanent low temperatures, hypersalinity, and extreme shade. One of the most striking phenotypes of UWO 241 is an altered PSI organization and constitutive PSI cyclic electron flow (CEF). To date, little attention has been paid to CEF during long-term stress acclimation, and the consequences of sustained CEF in UWO 241 are not known. In this study, we combined photobiology, proteomics, and metabolomics to understand the underlying role of sustained CEF in high-salinity stress acclimation. High salt-grown UWO 241 exhibited increased thylakoid proton motive flux and an increased capacity for nonphotochemical quenching. Under high salt, a significant proportion of the up-regulated enzymes were associated with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, carbon storage metabolism, and protein translation. Two key enzymes of the shikimate pathway, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase and chorismate synthase, were also up-regulated, as well as indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of l-Trp and indole acetic acid. In addition, several compatible solutes (glycerol, Pro, and Suc) accumulated to high levels in high salt-grown UWO 241 cultures. We suggest that UWO 241 maintains constitutively high CEF through the associated PSI-cytochrome b6f supercomplex to support robust growth and strong photosynthetic capacity under a constant growth regime of low temperatures and high salinity.",2020-01-01,Plant Physiology,https://openalex.org/V42294715,Oxford University Press,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1607621,,,,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013313682,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.01280,journal-article,3013313682

Investigating the impact of different parameters on their erosion behavior is essential before use in drug delivery systems. Although their synthesis is well-established, parameters that may substantially affect the erosion of thiol-ene polyanhydrides including temperature and pH of the media, the geometry of the polymers, and the media shaking rate (the convective force for the polymer erosion), have not yet been studied. This study explores the effects of different environmental and geometric parameters on mass loss (erosion) profiles of polyanhydrides synthesized by thiol-ene photopolymerization. A comparative study on several release kinetic models fitting is also described for a better understanding of the polymer erosion behavior. The results demonstrated that although the temperature was the only parameter that affected the induction period substantially, the mass-loss rate was influenced by the polymer composition, tablet geometry, temperature, pH, and mass transfer (shaking) rate. With regard to geometrical parameters, polymers with the same surface area to volume ratios showed similar mass loss trends despite their various volumes and surface areas. The mass loss of polyanhydride tablets with more complicated geometries than a simple slab was shown to be non-linear, and the kinetic model study indicated the dominant surface erosion mechanism.

The mouse embryonic multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cell line (10T1/2) provides an excellent tool for tissue engineering since it shares similar differentiation characteristics with mesenchymal stem cells. Although 10T1/2 cells have been widely studied in the context of skeletal tissue engineering, their differentiation to smooth muscle lineage is less known. In this study, we fabricated tubular electrospun poly(ester amide) (PEA) fibers from L-phenylalanine-derived biodegradable biomaterials and investigated cell-scaffold interactions as well as their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cell and subsequent elastin expression. PEA scaffolds fabricated under different collector speeds did not have an impact on the fiber directionality/orientation. 10T1/2 cytocompatibility and proliferation studies showed that PEA fibres were not cytotoxic and were able to support proliferation for 1 days. Furthermore, cells were observed infiltrating the fibrous scaffolds despite the small pore sizes (~  µm).

Since SS is an autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement, systemic immunosuppression may have a role in improving signs and symptoms and preventing progression. We undertook this review to assess the efficacy and safety of immunomodulation on primary SS from randomized clinical trials (RCTs).Five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Central, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched to include RCTs for the treatment of SS. Primary outcome measures included ocular dryness, oral dryness, tear production, and salivary function. Serious adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals due to AEs were also assessed.The search yielded 3 trials evaluating 1 different medications. The average duration of diagnosis was long (up to 9.2 years). Twenty-two trials examined ocular and oral dryness, for which only  and  trials showed statistically significant improvements, respectively. No studies found a benefit for tear production; few studies found improvements for unstimulated salivary flow ( of 1 RCTs) and stimulated salivary flow ( of 1 RCTs). Meta-analysis at  months found improvements as compared to placebo for unstimulated salivary flow (P = 0.003) and a decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.007). No differences were seen for serious AEs, but there were increased withdrawals from AEs (risk ratio 2.33; P = 0.03).Reducing inflammation potentially improves salivary gland function. No individual immunomodulatory drug demonstrated a consistent benefit in xerostomia and xerophthalmia.

However, a number of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies have reported the unexpected finding of inverse oxygenation: increased deoxyhemoglobin and decreased oxyhemoglobin during task periods. This finding questions the reliability of fNIRS for BCI applications given that MI activation should result in a focal increase in blood oxygenation. In an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon, fMRI and fNIRS data were acquired on 15 healthy participants performing a MI task. The fMRI data provided global coverage of brain activity, thus allowing visualization of all potential brain regions activated and deactivated during task periods. Indeed, fMRI results from seven subjects included activation in the primary motor cortex and/or the pre-supplementary motor area during the rest periods in addition to the expected activation in the supplementary motor and premotor areas. Of these seven subjects, two showed inverse oxygenation with fNIRS. The proximity of the regions showing inverse oxygenation to the motor planning regions suggests that inverse activation detected by fNIRS may likely be a consequence of partial volume errors due to the sensitivity of the optodes to both primary motor and motor planning regions.",2020-01-01,Neuroscience Letters,https://openalex.org/V203050076,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134607,134607,134607,714,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989432717,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134607,journal-article,2989432717

As epigenetic regulators, microRNAs can regulate placental development and contribute to the disease pathophysiology by influencing the expression of genes involved in placental development or disease. Our previous study revealed an increase in miR-210-5p expression in placentae from patients with early-onset pregnancy complications and identified candidate gene targets for miR-210-5p. The purpose of this study was to: (i) validate candidate gene targets predicted for miR-210-5p from microRNA-RNA expression data, and (ii) overexpress miR-210-5p in a trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) to assess impact on trophoblast cell functions. Integration of the miRNA and RNA sequencing expression data revealed 8 candidate gene targets for miR-210-5p in patients with PE only or PE + IUGR. Luciferase reporter assays identified two gene targets for miR-210-5p, CSF1 and ITGAM. Real-time PCR confirmed the decreased expression of CSF1 and ITGAM in patients with PE + IUGR. Immunohistochemistry of placentae from late second trimester identified CSF1 and ITGAM in intermediate trophoblast cells in the decidua. Expression levels of CSF1 and ITGAM were reduced in HTR-8/SVneo cells following increased miR-210-5p expression. Concomitantly, HTR-8/SVneo cells demonstrate an average 45% reduction in cell migration. These findings suggest that miR-210-5p may contribute to dysfunction of intermediate trophoblasts and potentially contribute to the disease process of these pregnancy complications.",2020-01-14,Pregnancy Hypertension,https://openalex.org/V2898367572,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preghy.2020.01.002,159,168,19,,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999901735,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preghy.2020.01.002,journal-article,2999901735

Minimizing artifacts associated with cardiac motion is also an important step in improving CT diagnostic accuracy of Coronary Artery Disease. Existing arterial phantoms are commonly straight, short tubular sections that are often rigid, and do not represent the geometry of the entire arterial network, with which image quality and Hounsfield Unit measurements vary and are dependent on. In this study, the process of manufacturing a plaque phantom with physiologically accurate geometry of the coronary arteries is demonstrated. A computer model is obtained by segmenting CTCA images, and several flexible commercially available materials are used to 3D print the model. The static and dynamic mechanical properties of the 3D printing materials are investigated under physiologically relevant loading and the CT numbers of contrast-enhanced tubular samples with 50%, 75%, and 90% concentric stenosis are characterized and compared with ranges for lipid-rich and fibrous plaque.

We studied ER/PR expression in LGSC tumors and cell lines to evaluate patient outcomes and cellular treatment responses.LGSC tumors and patient-derived cell lines were studied from patients with advanced-stage (III/IV) disease. Tumor samples and clinical data were obtained from the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource (COEUR-tissue microarray) and the Ovarian Cancer Research (OvCaRe) tissue bank. ER/PR expression was assessed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Two different IHC scoring systems (simple and Allred) were used. Cox regression was used to identify factors (age, disease residuum, ER/PR status, etc.) associated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Estradiol and tamoxifen proliferation and viability experiments were performed in LGSC cell lines.In 5 LGSC cases studied, median follow-up was 5 months (range 1-227). Fifty-three (96%) cases strongly expressed ER whereas 3 (67%) expressed PR. Cox-regression analysis showed that residuum (p < 0.001) was significantly associated with PFS, whereas both ER Allred score (p = 0.005) and residuum (p = 0.004) were significant for OS.

This has led to the theory that double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the intergenic DNA of plant mitogenomes are repaired by inaccurate mechanisms, such as break-induced replication, which can result in large insertions and, thus, could explain why these genomes are so prone to expansion. But how universal is this theory? Can it apply to other giant organelle DNAs, such as the massive plastid DNAs (ptDNAs) of chlamydomonadalean green algae? Indeed, it can. Analysis of the expanded plastomes from two distinct isolates of the unicellular chlamydomonadalean Chlorosarcinopsis eremi uncovered exceptionally low rates of synonymous substitution in the coding regions but high substitution rates, including frequent indels, in the noncoding ptDNA, mirroring the trend from land plant mitogenomes. Remarkably, nearly all of the substitutions and indels identified in the noncoding ptDNA of C. eremi occur adjacent to or within short inverted palindromic repeats, suggesting that these elements are mutational hotspots. Building upon earlier studies, I propose that these palindromic repeats are predisposed to DSBs and that error-prone repair of these breaks is contributing to genomic expansion. Short palindromic repeats are a common theme among bloated plastomes, including the largest one on record, meaning that these data could have wide-reaching implications for our understanding of ptDNA expansion.",2020-02-01,Genome Biology and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V10195028,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa012,,,,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3001585765,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa012,journal-article,3001585765

Several magmatic and/or hydrothermal models have previously been proposed to explain the range of enrichment in PGEs observed in the Marathon deposit, but no work has integrated textural and compositional variations in sulfides to elucidate which of these models is most suitable. Additionally, comparatively little work has been done to characterize the genesis of Cu-PGE mineralization that occurs to the northwest of the Marathon deposit in the Eastern Gabbro. Through integration of base metal sulfide (BMS) mineralogy, texture, and trace element chemistry, a wide range of magmatic and postmagmatic processes have been characterized that contributed to the formation of these deposits. In all zones of mineralization in the Eastern Gabbro, chalcophile elements were remobilized from primary chalcopyrite by hydrothermal fluids and precipitated as secondary chalcopyrite, which occurs as a replacement of pyrrhotite and as intergrowths with hydrous silicates. BMSs in the mineralized zones in the Marathon deposit (Footwall zone, Main zone, and W Horizon) experienced higher R factors than those deposits located northwest of the Marathon deposit (Four Dams, Area 41, and Redstone), with BMSs in the W Horizon having experienced the highest R factors. The silicate melts from which the Footwall zone crystallized likely experienced some degree of sulfide segregation at depth, albeit to a much lesser degree than the northern deposits. Additionally, the melts from which the mineralized zones in the Marathon deposit crystallized were likely contaminated by high-S/Se Archean sedimentary rocks, whereas the northern deposits were likely contaminated by low-S/Se igneous and/or metamorphic rocks. BMSs in a chalcopyrite-rich pod located within the vicinity of the Coldwell Complex experienced both high R factors and high degrees of contamination (cf. W Horizon and Footwall zone, respectively).

We studied hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons that form the apex of the HPA axis in a mouse model of stress habituation using repeated restraint. The intrinsic excitability of CRH neurons decreased after repeated stress in a time course that coincided with the development of HPA axis habituation. This intrinsic excitability plasticity co-developed with an expansion of surface membrane area, which increased a passive electric load and dampened membrane depolarization in response to the influx of positive charge. We report a novel structure-function relationship for intrinsic excitability plasticity as a neural correlate for HPA axis habituation. Abstract Encountering a stressor immediately activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, but this stereotypic stress response also undergoes experience-dependent adaptation. Despite the biological and clinical importance, how the brain adjusts stress responsiveness in the long term remains poorly understood. We studied hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons that form the apex of the HPA axis in a mouse model of stress habituation using repeated restraint. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute slices, we found that the intrinsic excitability of these neurons substantially decreased after daily repeated stress in a time course that coincided with their loss of stress responsiveness in vivo. This intrinsic excitability plasticity co-developed with an expansion of surface membrane area, which increased a passive electric load, and dampened membrane depolarization in response to the influx of positive charge. Multiphoton imaging and electron microscopy revealed that repeated stress augmented ruffling of the plasma membrane, suggesting an ultrastructural plasticity that may efficiently accommodate the membrane area expansion.

The coincident rise in IE and change of drug preference to hydromorphone controlled-release (CR) among our PWID population in London, Ontario intrigued us to study the details of injection practices leading to IE, which have not been well characterized in literature. Methods A case–control study, using one-on-one interviews to understand risk factors and injection practices associated with IE among PWID was conducted. Eligible participants included those who had injected drugs within the last  months, were &gt; 1 years old and either never had or were currently admitted for an IE episode. Cases were recruited from the tertiary care centers and controls without IE were recruited from outpatient clinics and addiction clinics in London, Ontario. Results Thirty three cases (PWID IE+) and 10 controls (PWID but IE-) were interviewed. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that the odds of having IE were 4.65 times higher among females (95% CI 1.85, 12.28; p = 0.001) and 5.76 times higher among PWID who did not use clean injection equipment from the provincial distribution networks (95% CI 2.37, 14.91; p &lt; 0.001). Injecting into multiple sites and heating hydromorphone-CR prior to injection were not found to be significantly associated with IE. Hydromorphone-CR was the most commonly injected drug in both groups (90.9% cases; 81.4% controls; p = 0.197). Discussion Our study highlights the importance of distributing clean injection materials for IE prevention. Furthermore, our study showcases that females are at higher risk of IE, which is contrary to the reported literature. Gender differences in injection techniques, which may place women at higher risk of IE, require further study. We suspect that the very high prevalence of hydromorphone-CR use made our sample size too small to identify a significant association between its use and IE, which has been established in the literature.",2020-06-05,Harm Reduction Journal,https://openalex.org/V150411170,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00378-z,,,17,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033593105,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00378-z,journal-article,3033593105

However, particles in the CFB riser aggregate to form clusters, which significantly influences the contact efficiency. However, cluster properties in the literature deviate up to one order of magnitude, even at similar operating conditions. This circumstance hinders the understanding of fluidization and, to a large extent, attributes to subjective methods to identify the cluster boundary. In this study, cold-flow experiments were conducted in a large-scale CFB (7.6 m high) and the flow behavior in the transparent rectangular riser was well recorded using a high-speed camera. With direct image calibration, the grayscale in images was converted to solids holdup pixel by pixel, then solids holdup gradient was computed to explore the cluster boundary. With the verification using optical fiber probe, an abrupt increase of solids holdup is found to exist around clusters, evidencing the phase segregation.

Infants were scanned with 3D cranial ultrasound in the first few months of life, and their neurodevelopmental outcome at 4, 8, 12, and 24 months corrected age (CA) was examined. Forty-nine infants who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were enrolled in the study. Subjects were scanned multiple times during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. Images were manually segmented to measure total volume of the lateral ventricles, and the highest volume was taken. Infants with a volume ≤ 20 cc were considered low-volume (n = 33), and infants with a volume ≥ 40 cc were considered high-volume (n = 12). Developmental outcome was assessed at 4, 8, and 12 months CA with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Infant Neurological International Battery (Infanib), and at 24 months CA with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3e (BSID III). Infants in the low-volume group had higher scores on the Infanib at 4 months CA, and on both the AIMS and Infanib at 8 and 12 months CA, even after controlling for gestational age, birth weight, and worst grade of IVH. We observed a trend where low-volume infants also scored higher on the cognitive and gross-motor subtests of the BSID III at 24 months CA. Our results show that ventricular volume affects neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with IVH.

They can have lasting effects on population dynamics when they reduce the fitness of native individuals. The establishment and spread of invasive Halyomorpha halys, in Europe and North America, have presented native natural enemies in the introduced areas with such a challenge. The native parasitoids readily parasitize eggs of H. halys, but their progeny rarely develops in fresh eggs of this host. The barriers to successful development of native parasitoids in H. halys eggs remain unidentified, and the affected developmental processes therein remain unclear. To determine the timing of failed development of native parasitoids in fresh H. halys eggs, we examined the temporal development of the Trissolcus euschisti parasitoid within suitable (Podisus maculiventis) and unsuitable (Halyomorpha halys) host eggs using a DNA barcode-based approach, and in situ 3D visualization by X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Trissolcus euschisi parasitoid development in fresh H. halys eggs fails soon after parasitization either during the egg stage or during early-stage larval development, as limited or no larval development was observed 24 h after initial parasitization. In light of these findings, we propose a time window for further investigation of several potential mechanisms that might result in failed parasitoid development in H. halys.",2020-02-01,Biological Control,https://openalex.org/V161676133,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.104124,104124,104124,141,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2977451866,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.104124,journal-article,2977451866

Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs) are the proteins that directly sense ER Ca2+ content and gate Orai1 channels due to store depletion. The trigger for STIM activation is Ca2+ unbinding from the ER lumen-oriented domains, which consist of a nonconserved amino (N) terminal region and EF-hand and sterile α motif (SAM) domains (EF-SAM), highly conserved from humans to Caenorhabditis elegans. Solution NMR structures of the human EF-SAM domains have been determined at high Ca2+ concentrations; however, no direct structural view of the Ca2+ binding mode has been elucidated. Further, no atomic resolution data currently exists on EF-SAM at low Ca2+ levels. Here, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the C. elegans STIM luminal domain, revealing that EF-SAM binds a single Ca2+ ion with pentagonal bipyramidal geometry and an ancillary α-helix formed by the N-terminal region acts as a brace to stabilize EF-SAM. Using solution NMR, we observed EF-hand domain unfolding and a conformational exchange between folded and unfolded states involving the ancillary α-helix and the canonical EF-hand in low Ca2+. Remarkably, we also detected an α-helix (+Ca2+) to β-strand (-Ca2+) transition at the terminal SAM domain α-helix. Collectively, our analyses indicate that one canonically bound Ca2+ ion is sufficient to stabilize the quiescent luminal domain structure, precluding unfolding, conformational exchange, and secondary structure transformation.",2020-01-17,Journal of Molecular Biology,https://openalex.org/V46058472,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.10.003,367,383,432,2,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980379467,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.10.003,journal-article,2980379467

Pluripotent stem cells are functionally coupled via connexins that serve in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and here we report that the level of connexin expression in pluripotent stem cells depends upon the state in which stem cells exist in vitro. Human and mouse pluripotent stem cells stabilized in a developmentally primitive or “naïve” state exhibit significantly less connexin expression compared with stem cells which are “primed” for differentiation. This dynamic connexin expression pattern may be governed, in part, by differential regulation by pluripotency transcription factors expressed in each cell state. Species-specific differences do exist, however, with mouse stem cells expressing several additional connexin transcripts not found in human pluripotent stem cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GJIC shows limited impact on naïve human stem cell survival, self-renewal, and pluripotency but plays a more significant role in primed human pluripotent stem cells. However, CRISPR-Cas9 gene ablation of Cx43 in human and mouse primed and naïve pluripotent stem cells reveals that Cx43 is dispensable in each of these four pluripotent stem cell types.",2020-01-01,Stem Cells,https://openalex.org/V65139510,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3092,52,66,38,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981840909,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3092,journal-article,2981840909

However, no attempt has been reported due to its challenges of the large variation of fundus appearance across patients, heavy overlap and extremely weak contrast between optic nerve head areas. In this paper, we propose a multitask collaborative learning framework (MCL-Net) for multi-indices ONH quantification. The proposed MCL-Net, a two-branch neural network, first obtains expressive shared and task-specific representations with the backbone network and its two branches; then models the feature exchanges and aggregations between two branches with a well-designed feature interaction module (FIM) to promote each other collaboratively. After that, it estimates multiple types of ONH indices under a multitask ensemble module (MEM) that is capable of learning aggregation of multiple outputs automatically. Therefore, the proposed MCL-Net is consisted of the feature representation, inter-task feature interaction, dual-branch task-specific prediction, and multitask quantification ensemble, which establish an effective framework which takes full advantages of segmentation and estimation tasks for multi-indices ONH quantification. Rather than the low-level feature sharing and individual prediction, the proposed MCL-Net collaboratively learns an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representation, as well as the aggregated prediction, therefore leads to accurate quantification of ONH with multiple types of indices. Experimental results on the dataset of 650 fundus images show that MCL-Net successfully delivers accurate quantification of all the three types of ONH indices, with average mean absolute error of 0.98 ± 0.20, 0.97 ± 0.16, 1.19 ± 0.18, as well as average correlation coefficient of 0.699, 0.708 and 0.691, for diameters, whole areas and regional areas, respectively. In addition, the experiments demonstrate that quantitative indices obtained by our method provide more effective glaucoma diagnosis with AUC of 0.8698.

Using the bed collapse test, the dense phase properties of those formed Group C+ and Group A particles were characterized. Group C+ particles exhibited much higher dense phase expansion and larger dense phase voidage than Group A particles, indicating more gas holdup in the dense phase available for intimate gas-solid contact. Therefore, Group C+ particles, with the extraordinary dense phase expansion and the large specific surface area, are significantly better for industrial processes, especially in gas-phase catalytic reactions.

The analysis of the performance of the geobag wall system as a flexible retaining wall to support an embankment was conducted employing the discrete element method (DEM) code PFC2D. The slope soil was simulated as bonded balls utilizing the contact-bond model, and the recycled concrete aggregate was treated as unbonded balls based on the linear contact stiffness model. The geotextile of the geobags was set as ball clusters with the parallel bond model. The corresponding parameters of the slope soil, aggregate, and geotextile were derived from biaxial tests, large-scale direct shearing tests, tensile tests, and modified shearing tests. These parameters were calibrated by contrasting the measured data with the numerical results. Utilizing the calibrated parameters, numerical models were established for slopes strengthened by the geobag wall systems, which had been investigated in a series of experimental indoor 1-g model tests. The numerical results were contrasted with the measured data in terms of settlement, horizontal displacement, soil pressure, and crack distribution.

The syncytiotrophoblast (ST) is the transporting epithelium of the human placenta, and decreased expression of amino acid transporter isoforms in the ST plasma membranes is believed to contribute to IUGR. Placental mechanistic target of rapamycin Complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling is inhibited in IUGR and regulates the trafficking of key amino acid transporter (AAT) isoforms to the ST plasma membrane; however, the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Cdc42 and Rac1 are Rho-GTPases that regulate actin-binding proteins, thereby modulating the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesized that inhibition of mTORC2 decreases AAT expression in the plasma membrane and amino acid uptake in primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells mediated by down-regulation of Cdc42 and Rac1. mTORC2, but not mTORC1, inhibition decreased the Cdc42 and Rac1 expression. Silencing of Cdc42 and Rac1 inhibited the activity of the System L and A transporters and markedly decreased the trafficking of LAT1 (System L isoform) and SNAT2 (System A isoform) to the plasma membrane. mTORC2 inhibition by silencing of rictor failed to decrease AAT following activation of Cdc42/Rac1. Placental Cdc42 and Rac1 protein expression was down-regulated in human IUGR and was positively correlated with placental mTORC2 signaling. In conclusion, mTORC2 regulates AAT trafficking in PHT cells by modulating Cdc42 and Rac1. Placental mTORC2 inhibition in human IUGR may contribute to decreased placental amino acid transfer and reduced fetal growth mediated by down-regulation of Cdc42 and Rac1.",2020-01-17,Clinical Science,https://openalex.org/V206649051,Portland Press,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20190794,53,70,134,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998690880,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20190794,journal-article,2998690880

METHODS A total of 252 patients underwent aortic arch repair with hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) between 200 and 201 in 1 centres of the Canadian Thoracic Aortic Collaborative. Primary outcomes included mortality; stroke; a composite of mortality or stroke; and a Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite (STS-COMP) end point for mortality or major morbidity including stroke, reoperation, renal failure, prolonged ventilation and deep sternal wound infection. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching were performed for cerebral perfusion and nadir temperature practices. RESULTS Antegrade cerebral perfusion was found on multivariable analysis to be protective against mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.86; P = 0.005], stroke (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81; P = 0.006), composite of mortality or stroke (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45–0.72; P = 0.0001) and STS-COMP (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41–0.67; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as compared to HCA alone.

We demonstrate a label-free microfabricated thickness shear mode electroacoustic device based on a ZnO piezoelectric film for the assay of cardiac biomarkers. This device combines an immunologic sensitive element with the resonator working in biological liquids. Based on the gravimetric mechanism, the immunoreaction between the target antigens and antibodies was detected by monitoring the frequency change in real-time to determine the concentration of cardiac troponins I. The device exhibits a linear response from 0.04 to 2 ng/ml and a low detection limit of 20 pg/ml in serum containing cardiac troponin I. The clinical samples collected from healthy controls and cardiac patients were directly used without any additional pre-treatment. The cardiac troponin concentrations measured by the proposed device shows good linear correlation and consistency compared with standard laboratory methods.

Canada has recently welcomed an influx of refugees, many of whom experienced significant trauma and adversity before coming to Canada or during migration. Thousands of newcomer children and youth are now in Canadian schools, and many continue to struggle with symptoms of distress and trauma. During the spring of 2018, a pilot was conducted in two large Ontario school districts to evaluate the feasibility of a new 10-week manualized intervention (Supporting Transition Resilience of Newcomer Groups [STRONG]) developed to promote resilience and reduce distress among young newcomers. In the current study, stakeholders involved in the pilot (i.e., mental health clinicians, mental health leaders, developers of the STRONG program, and the evaluation team) participated in an online Group Concept Mapping (GCM) activity to document the groups' collective wisdom about developing and implementing appropriate programming for newcomer children and youth. Twenty-three stakeholders generated a list of considerations related to designing, implementing, and facilitating programs to promote resilience among newcomer children and youth, producing a total of 71 statements. Eighteen stakeholders then sorted the list of statements into meaningful categories. Through multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis we identified five clusters of important considerations: (1) engage family and community; (2) take a whole school approach; (3) attend to group composition and setting; (4) make material accessible and age-appropriate; and, (5) address unique clinical issues. Theoretically, these clusters highlight the importance of considering individual needs, system considerations, and design considerations.

Strategies have been developed to identify children suspected of having been exposed to maltreatment with the aim of reducing further maltreatment and impairment. This systematic review evaluates the accuracy of strategies for identifying children exposed to maltreatment. Methods We conducted a systematic search of seven databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Libraries, Sociological Abstracts and the Education Resources Information Center. We included studies published from 196 to July 2, 201 estimating the accuracy of instruments for identifying potential maltreatment of children, including neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse. We extracted data about accuracy and narratively synthesised the evidence. For five studies—where the population and setting matched known prevalence estimates in an emergency department setting—we calculated false positives and negatives. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2. Results We included 3 articles (representing 3 studies) that evaluated various identification strategies, including three screening tools (SPUTOVAMO checklist, Escape instrument, and a 6-item screening questionnaire for child sex trafficking). No studies evaluated the effects of identification strategies on important outcomes for children. All studies were rated as having serious risk of bias (often because of verification bias). The findings suggest that use of the SPUTOVAMO and Escape screening tools at the population level (per 100,000) would result in hundreds of children being missed and thousands of children being over identified. Conclusions There is low to very low certainty evidence that the use of screening tools may result in high numbers of children being falsely suspected or missed. These harms may outweigh the potential benefits of using such tools in practice (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016039659).",2020-03-07,BMC Pediatrics,https://openalex.org/V134535697,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-2015-4,,,20,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011286884,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-2015-4,journal-article,3011286884

TRPM8 is a cold and menthol-sensitive channel found in a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Deletion or inhibition of the TRPM8 channel was found to prevent the cold hyperalgesia induced by chronic administration of morphine. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which morphine was able to promote cold hypersensitivity in DRG neurons and transfected HEK cells. Mice daily injected with morphine for 5 days developed cold hyperalgesia. Treatment with morphine did not alter the expressions of cold sensitive TREK-1, TRAAK and TRPM8 in DRGs. However, TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons isolated from morphine-treated mice exhibited hyperexcitability. Sustained morphine treatment in vitro sensitized TRPM8 responsiveness to cold or menthol and reduced activation-evoked desensitization of the channel. Blocking phospholipase C (PLC) as well as protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), but not protein kinase A (PKA) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), restored channel desensitization. Identification of two PKC phosphorylation consensus sites, S1040 and S1041, in the TRPM8 and their site-directed mutation were able to prevent the MOR-induced reduction in TRPM8 desensitization. Our results show that activation of MOR by morphine 1) promotes hyperexcitability of TRPM8-expressing neurons and 2) induces a PKCβ-mediated reduction of TRPM8 desensitization. This MOR-PKCβ dependent modulation of TRPM8 may underlie the onset of cold hyperalgesia caused by repeated administration of morphine. Our findings point to TRPM8 channel and PKCβ as important targets for opioid-induced cold hypersensitivity.",2020-04-14,Molecular Brain,https://openalex.org/V182046277,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00599-0,,,13,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016104954,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-00599-0,journal-article,3016104954

We find important areas of consensus, including that trauma exposure is associated with depersonalization and, occasionally, memory errors; reports of dissociative symptoms may be elevated due to non-trauma factors; error rates for diagnosing dissociative identity disorder are low; and multiple sources of information are required for assessing any symptom, including dissociation, in forensic contexts. Our goals in this paper are to accurately summarize our evidence-based position about dissociation as it relates to forensic contexts and to call for more scientific discourse and less motivated skepticism by all involved scholars. We enumerate and demonstrate our critics’ reliance on eight forms of rhetoric that are largely rejected by the scientific community. We illustrate these forms of argument using Merckelbach et al.’s published responses in this lengthy debate as exemplars. Recognition of our critics’ reliance on these forms of argumentation is crucial to making further substantial progress in this debate. We argue that recovered memories of trauma should be evaluated in court using the same criteria that would be used with any other memory, including seeking out and evaluating corroborating and disconfirming evidence.

However, little is known regarding ICU costs of acute poisoning.This was a retrospective matched database analysis of patients admitted to the ICU with acute poisoning from 201 to 2014. It was performed in  ICUs within a single tertiary care hospital system. All patient information, outcomes, and costs were stored in the hospital data warehouse. Control patients were defined as randomly selected age-, sex-, severity index-, and comorbidity index-matched nonpoisoned ICU patients (1:4 matching ratio).A total of 845 critically ill patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 27 had a diagnosis of acute poisoning. The mean age was 44.5 years, and the most common xenobiotics implicated were sedative hypnotics (20.2%), antidepressants (15.2%), and opioids (10.5%). Of these, 73.6% of poisonings were deemed intentional. In-hospital mortality of poisoned patients was 5.1%, compared to 11.1% for control patients (P < .01). The median ICU length of stay (LOS) for poisoned patients was 3.0 days, compared with 4.0 days for control patients (P < .01). The mean total cost for poisoned patients was CAD$1 958. Control patients had a significantly higher mean total cost of CAD$6 62 (P < .01). The xenobiotics associated with the highest costs were acetaminophen (CAD$1 585), toxic alcohols (CAD$1 771), and opioids (CAD$1 967).In our cohort, we confirmed the long-held belief that patients admitted to the ICU with a primary diagnosis of poisoning have a lower mortality rate, ICU LOS, and overall cost per ICU admission than nonpoisoned patients.

Biomass steam gasification produces a blend of H 2 , CO, CH  and CO 2 , designated as syngas. Syngas can be further combusted using fluidizable oxygen carriers (OC). This operation which is known as Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), is valuable for syngas combustion as it involves nickel oxidation and nickel reduction, which are both exothermic reactions. To improve syngas CLC and establish its application, a new Ni-based oxygen carrier was studied using a Co and La modified γ-Al 2 O  support.

However, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work develops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference, which is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We propose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs with quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image into superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels depends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF is an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as superpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an intuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF. For efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an approximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller domain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion moves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly lower energy compared to that of mean field inference.

While extant literature offers an explanation as to why heterogeneity in the effectiveness of sponsorship emerges based on the sponsor's characteristics, current theorizing largely overlooks how sponsorship interacts with local economic conditions. This study introduces insights from urban economics to extend organizational sponsorship theory by showing how different types of agglomeration economies affect the effectiveness of organizational sponsorship. We test our hypotheses with a comprehensive database that includes over 46,000 sponsored and non-sponsored firms in the years 1997–2007. Our results reveal organizational sponsorship delays new venture exit when urbanization levels are low, localization is low, and both urbanization and localization are high. Executive Summary. Organizational sponsorship (OS) is an institutional arrangement whereby private or public entities provide assistance to new firm ventures. Since young firms face low survival chances at birth, it is assumed that any assistance such firms receive is to their advantage. However, very little research supports this assumption ( Clayton et al., 201 ; Dutt et al., 201 ). It is in this context that we examine the impact of OS in different regional environments. Specifically, we look at the interplay between business incubation, a ubiquitous form of OS, urbanization, the city-scale of the region in which the firm is founded, and localization, the presence of same-industry firms in the region, in determining new venture survival. By exploring this interaction, we identify how the efficacy of OS varies in differing environmental circumstances. Additionally, it provides a better understanding of the specific OS mechanisms that are most likely to promote new venture survival depending on regional characteristics. For the purposes of our study, we combine insights from OS and agglomeration literatures. Specifically, we look at the interplay between the bridging, buffering and curating functions of OS with the externalities that arise from urbanization and localization. We consider the regional characteristics that provide new ventures with positive agglomeration externalities of input sharing, quick and quality matching with resource providers, and knowledge spillovers. Similarly, we also consider regional characteristics that give rise to negative externalities of rising costs and congestion. Thus, we identify urbanization and localization scenarios in which new ventures are most in need of buffering from competition, in the form of financial aid and subsidies, and scenarios where new ventures need to be bridged or curated with non-monetary resources such as accountants, lawyers, or industry-specific suppliers and investors. That is, we identify founding environments in which OS functions are most valuable. We test our hypothesis on a population of US business incubators operating between 199 and 2007. To study the impact of OS at different levels of urbanization and localization, we compare the probability of exit by incubated new ventures with that of a control group of non-incubated new ventures in the same county. We find that incubators are most effective in improving the survival of new ventures when both localization and urbanization in the founding environment are low or when both are high. By linking OS literature with agglomeration literature our study identifies the conditions under which OS is most effective and finds that it is most effective when mitigating the lows of resource-deprived environments or the highs of a hyper-competitive landscape. We also extend the theoretical link between these two streams of literature by identifying the critical role of the OS function of curating in a highly localized and urbanized environment. Our study sheds new light on why OS is often met with varying levels of success in promoting new venture survival. We see that specific regional characteristics determine the type of OS mechanisms that are most beneficial. Thus, for instance, simply mimicking successful incubators in one region may not lead to success for incubators in other regions. Furthermore, we see that OS is counterproductive in regions with low urbanization and high localization. Together, these findings suggest that policy-makers need to consider the specific constraints faced by entrepreneurs in different regions before they seek to promote entrepreneurship through OS. It also stresses the need for entrepreneurs to do due diligence prior to joining an incubator.",2020-07-01,Journal of Business Venturing,https://openalex.org/V66201313,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.105967,105967,105967,35,4,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2974576538,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.105967,journal-article,2974576538

Scaffolds (pore sizes, 165-230 μm and porosity, 53.51-69.51%) were prepared using a polymer foam replication technique. BRT scaffolds exhibited higher compressive strength (7.16 ± 0.2 MPa) when compared to BRT (6.02 ± 0.4 MPa) and BRT1 (5.65 ± 0.2 MPa) scaffolds with lower, or no, TiO2 content. The solubility of the scaffolds decreased as the TiO2 content increased up to 15 mol% when samples of each scaffold were immersed in DI water and the pH of all these extracts went up from 7.0 to 8.5 in 3 days. The cumulative ion release from the scaffolds showed significant difference with respect to TiO2 content; addition of 5 mol% TiO2 at the expense of borate (B2O3) decreased the ion release remarkably. Furthermore, it was found that for all three scaffolds, cumulative ion release increased with incubation time.

Evidence of city-level effectiveness from Canada’s London,"Abstract To stabilize and grow their local economies, cities in Canada and other advanced economic regions have begun using place branding to attract high-skilled and well-educated immigrants. This is part of a larger trend where place branding is viewed as a necessary undertaking to respond to local issues. Despite the increased attention, there is considerable uncertainty over whether place branding is effective. To address this question, this research investigates place branding’s role in influencing immigrant place perception and decision-making on where to live. A seven-factor model was used to capture 739 evaluations of the City of London, Canada and five other cities in the Province of Ontario. Responses were analyzed with ANOVA contrast tests and multivariate regression to identify differences in place and brand perceptions between the five cities. Findings identified that immigrant views of the cities differed and influenced decision-making on where to live. Interestingly, perceptions about the economy and housing were the key drivers of the evaluation of cities, rather than traditional branding and promotional efforts. The implication is that cities need to be strategic in their branding efforts to ensure they promote the features of the city that are meaningful to the target audiences being pursued.",2020-02-01,Cities,https://openalex.org/V137445289,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.102502,102502,102502,97,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989930109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.102502,journal-article,2989930109

It is unclear whether adding vasopressin or vasopressin analogues to catecholamine therapy is beneficial in the management of patients with distributive shock. The purpose of this guideline was to develop an evidence-based recommendation regarding the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors in the management of adults with distributive shock. We summarized the evidence informing this recommendation by updating a recently published meta-analysis. Then, a multidisciplinary panel from the Canadian Critical Care Society developed the recommendation using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The updated systematic review identified 25 randomized controlled trials including a total of 3,737 patients with distributive shock. Compared with catecholamine therapy alone, the addition of vasopressin or its analogues was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 0.99; low certainty), reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.88; high certainty), and increased risk of digital ischemia (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.25; moderate certainty).

This study evaluated the photoreactor efficiency of purple phototropic bacteria anaerobic membrane bioreactor (PAnMBR) at low irradiance for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Infrared irradiance levels of 3.0 and 1.4 W/m2 produced by an infrared (IR) lamp emitting in the 800-900 nm wavelength range were investigated, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the irradiance energy demand. Experimental and modeling results demonstrated the ability of PPB to grow and treat raw municipal wastewater at the applied low irradiances, with effluent quality below target limits of TCOD˂50 mg/L, TN˂10 mg/L, and TP˂1 mg/L. While Monod kinetic parameters, km and Y, were determined to be lower than previous high-energy studies (1.9 mgCOD/mgVSS-d and 0.3 mgVSS/mgCOD, respectively), the photobioreactor performance were consistently maintained, indicating that energy cost associated with IR illumination can be reduced by up to 97%. To determine whether the treatment process could approach energy neutrality, subsequent anaerobic digestion experiments of the residual PPB biomass proved a potential for biogas recovery of up to 240 NmLCH4/gVSSadded, and a moderate biomass biodegradability of 41%. As a result, the net energy consumption of the process was estimated at 0. kWh/m3 of treated municipal wastewater, considering an energy demand for illumination of 0.6 kWh/m3 and an energy recovery attributed to the anaerobic digestion of 0.1 kWh/m3 from the excess PPB biomass wasted from PAnMBR.",2020-04-15,Water Research,https://openalex.org/V52566953,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115535,115535,115535,173,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003638816,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115535,journal-article,3003638816

Since their discovery in 1965, S100 proteins have remained enigmatic in terms of their cellular functions. In this review, we summarize the calcium- and zinc-binding properties of the dimeric S100B and S100A1 proteins and highlight data that shed new light on the extracellular and intracellular regulation and functions of S100B. We point out that S100B and S100A1 homodimers are not functionally interchangeable and that in a S100A1/S100B heterodimer, S100A1 acts as a negative regulator for the ability of S100B to bind Zn2+ . The Ca2+ and Zn2+ -dependent interactions of S100B with a wide array of proteins form the basis of its activities and have led to the derivation of some initial rules for S100B recognition of protein targets. However, recent findings have strongly suggested that these rules need to be revisited. Here, we describe a new consensus S100B binding motif present in intracellular and extracellular vertebrate-specific proteins and propose a new model for stable interactions of S100B dimers with full-length target proteins.

Unexpectedly, mRNA levels of these genes were as high, or higher, in EBV-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGCs) compared to normal control tissues or other GC subtypes. This coordinated upregulation could have been a consequence of the higher intratumoral levels of interferon γ in EBVaGCs, which correlated with signatures of increased infiltration by T and natural killer (NK) cells.

During chill coma, movement of Na+ and water from the hemolymph to the gut lumen disrupt ion and water balance. Recovery from cold exposure requires re-establishment of this balance, and failure to do so results in chilling injury or death. We hypothesized that the passive leak of Na+ and consequently water during cold exposure is driven by the [Na+] differential between the gut and hemolymph. To determine the extent to which this [Na+] differential affects cold tolerance, we used artificial diets to load the guts of fall field crickets (Gryllus pennsylvanicus) with various concentrations of Na+. Manipulating [Na+] differentials had no effect on the CTmin, agreeing with recent studies demonstrating that chill coma onset precedes loss of ion balance in the cold. A high [Na+] diet reversed the direction of the [Na+] differential between the gut and hemolymph. Crickets fed a high [Na+] diet recovered from 12 h of chill coma nearly twice as fast as those fed low [Na+] diets. However, the high [Na+] diet was detrimental to survival after prolonged cold exposure (three days at 0 °C).

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is based primarily around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (order Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. Here were studied haemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., haemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 46 bats spanning 3 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were haemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Haemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported codivergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared haemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare-but detectable-bacterial sharing between species.

Results 1 11 individuals were contacted at home and assessed for study eligibility. Of the 126 eligible individuals, 91 (72%) enrolled and underwent spirometry. Ultimately, 18 subjects (20% of those enrolled) had obstructive lung disease (73 asthma and 11 COPD). Individuals found to have undiagnosed asthma or COPD had more severe respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life compared with those without airflow obstruction. The ASQ, COPD-DQ, and CAT had ROC areas for predicting undiagnosed asthma or COPD of 0.49, 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. Four descriptive variables (age, BMI, sex and pack-years smoked) produced better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values than the questionnaires (ROC area=0.68). Conclusion 20% of randomly selected individuals who report respiratory symptoms in Canada have undiagnosed airflow obstruction due to asthma or COPD. Questionnaires could exclude subjects at low risk but lack the ability to accurately find subjects with undiagnosed disease.",2020-01-01,The European respiratory journal,https://openalex.org/V4210207896,European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00024-2020,2000024,2000024,55,6,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3017341212,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00024-2020,journal-article,3017341212

We also modeled the characteristics of children, parents, and families associated with each identified trajectory.Data came from the HERQULES (Health-Related Quality of Life in Children With Epilepsy Study), a Canada-wide prospective cohort study of children (aged 4-12 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Parents reported on their children's HRQOL at diagnosis, and at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 8-, and 10-year follow-ups using the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire-55. Trajectories of HRQOL were identified using latent class growth models. Characteristics of children, parents, and families at the time of diagnosis that were associated with each trajectory were identified using multinomial logistic regression.A total of 36 children were included. Four unique HRQOL trajectories were identified; 11% of the cohort was characterized by low and stable scores, 18% by intermediate and stable scores, 35% by intermediate scores that increased then plateaued, and 43% by high scores that increased then plateaued. Absence of comorbidities, less severe epilepsy, and better family environment (greater satisfaction with family relationships and fewer family demands) at the time of diagnosis were associated with better long-term HRQOL trajectories. Although the analyses used estimates for missing values and accounted for any nonrandom attrition, the proportion of children with poorer HRQOL trajectories may be underestimated.Children with new onset epilepsy are heterogenous and follow unique HRQOL trajectories over the long term. Overall, HRQOL improves for the majority in the first  years after diagnosis, with these improvements sustained over the long term.",2020-07-01,Epilepsia,https://openalex.org/V203153751,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16579,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3034861687,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16579,journal-article,3034861687

Plants in each country choose a fraction of inputs to optimally source from the lowest cost supplier country, with the rest purchased domestically. Sourcing more inputs requires higher up-front …xed costs, but reduces variable input costs. Consistent with a broad set of studies with plant-level data, not all plants import; import shares vary among those that do; importers are larger than nonimporters; and importing more leads to higher productivity.

The MAP is a longitudinal study that follows active case ﬁles of mid-adolescents in a large urban child protective services (CPS) system. The MAP is a unique opportunity to collect information from teens about their physical health (e.g., sleep quality), mental health (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) and cognitive style (e.g., attention, memory). The MAP study samples the population of CPS teens on questions that are used in provincial teen surveys, allowing for points of comparison to non-CPS teens. The MAP tracks youth development over 2.5 years. Although the MAP currently has a very small number of Aboriginal teens, the responses of these teens may focus practitioner and researcher attention to priority areas for further research. This includes the investigation of how some research issues, such as maltreatment history, personal safety, relationship to primary CPS worker and suicidal ideation, may be cross-informative. It is known that teen risk behaviours cluster together, but it is important to understand the relationships among these variables. An understanding of these relationships can drive knowledge creation, as well as practice and policy change.

The authors draw on self-affirmation theory to propose that the choice of an ethical product serves a self-restorative function. Four experiments provide support for this assertion: a self-threat increases consumers’ choice of an ethical option, even when the alternative choice is objectively superior in quantity (Study 1) and product quality (Study 2). Further, restoring self-esteem through positive feedback eliminates this increase in ethical choice (Studies 2 and 3). As an additional test of the robustness of our results, a final study examined the effect of self-threat on choice in a field setting (Study 4).

Average solids holdup in the downer is measured where different liquid velocity and different solids circulation rate in terms of superficial solids velocity. For both types of particles, axial solids holdup distribution is quite uniform under various operating conditions, while radial solids holdup distributions are slightly non-uniform with a minor increase in solids holdup adjacent to the wall under various operating conditions, but no obvious “core-annulus” structure is observed.

However, less is known regarding how the drug affects these circuits after acute administration. The current study examined the effects of a single dose of methamphetamine on resting state frontostriatal functional connectivity in healthy volunteers. Participants (n = 22, 12 female) completed two sessions in which they received methamphetamine (20 mg) and placebo before a resting state scan during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants also provided self-report measures of euphoria and stimulation at regular intervals. We conducted seed-based voxelwise functional connectivity analyses using three bilateral striatal seed regions: nucleus accumbens (NAcc), caudate, and putamen and compared connectivity following methamphetamine versus placebo administration. Additionally, we conducted correlational analyses to assess if drug-induced changes in functional connectivity were related to changes in subjective response. Methamphetamine increased NAcc functional connectivity with medial frontal regions (ie, orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus) and decreased NAcc functional connectivity with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Methamphetamine also increased functional connectivity between putamen and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and individuals who displayed greater drug-induced increase in connectivity reported less euphoria and stimulation. These findings provide important information regarding the effects of methamphetamine on brain function in nonaddicted individuals.

Physiotherapists have earned a reputation as important providers of medical and non-medical rehabilitation for Canadians after injury, illness, or surgery. Despite the fact that physiotherapy has a nearly 100-year presence in Canada, some would suggest that practitioners arguably remain under-recognized for the value they offer to the spectrum of health care. Method: In the latter half of 2017, a cross-Canada qualitative study was conducted through which a subgroup of physiotherapists in every Canadian province and in Yukon Territory volunteered to share their perspectives on the threats facing the current practice of physiotherapy in the next 5–15 years. The data were collected from a series of nominal-group-technique-based focus groups and one-on-one interviews and then analyzed to condense the ideas generated into themes. A total of 11 physiotherapy professionals participated in focus sessions or one-on-one interviews as part of the Physio Moves Canada project, which was set up to explore, capture, and synthesize the perspectives of academics, front-line clinicians, and administrators on the future of the profession. Results: This article, the third in a series, describes the results of the descriptive thematic analysis of three identified threats: issues pertaining to professional leadership and direction, clinician burnout, and clarity of the physiotherapy brand. Informed by 1 sub-themes, the results suggest that participants were concerned about the ability of the professional body to mobilize toward shared and common goals while simultaneously defending against external pressures and internal disagreements on what exactly physiotherapy as a discipline is meant to be.

However, large population-based studies are lacking, particularly regarding involuntary hospitalisation. We sought to examine the risk of involuntary admission among first-generation ethnic minority groups with early psychosis in Ontario, Canada. Methods Using health administrative data, we constructed a retrospective cohort (2009–2013) of people with first-onset non-affective psychotic disorder aged 16–35 years. This cohort was linked to immigration data to ascertain migrant status and country of birth. We identified the first involuntary admission within  years and compared the risk of involuntary admission for first-generation migrant groups to the general population. To control for the role of migrant status, we restricted the sample to first-generation migrants and examined differences by country of birth, comparing risk of involuntary admission among ethnic minority groups to a European reference. We further explored the role of migrant class by adjusting for immigrant vs refugee status within the migrant cohort. We also explored effect modification of migrant class by ethnic minority group. Results We identified 1 84 incident cases of psychotic disorder, of whom 19% ( n = 3049) were first-generation migrants. Risk of involuntary admission was higher than the general population in five of seven ethnic minority groups. African and Caribbean migrants had the highest risk of involuntary admission (African: risk ratio (RR) = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.34–1.73; Caribbean: RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.37–1.82), and were the only groups where the elevated risk persisted when compared to the European reference group within the migrant cohort (African: RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.04–1.48; Caribbean: RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07–1.56). Refugee status was independently associated with involuntary admission (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02–1.32); however, this risk varied by ethnic minority group, with Caribbean refugees having an elevated risk of involuntary admission compared with Caribbean immigrants (RR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.15–2.58).

2020,9,9,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2982203934,Online measurement of CO2 and total gas production in parallel anaerobic shake flask cultivations,"Abstract Online measurements of off-gas streams are often crucial for studying bioconversion processes. However, for anaerobic processes, options for online off-gas analysis are typically restricted to lab-scale bioreactors or larger systems, while gas measurements at smaller scales typically do not discriminate between different gases. In this work, a method for online measurement of CO2 and total gas production in anaerobic fermentations at the shake flask scale is described, extending capabilities of a previously reported device developed for aerobic processes to anaerobic bioprocesses. The novel design allows anaerobic fermentations to be performed in multiple parallel vessels, all of which collect online gas signals.

Based on analysis of high resolution time series biogeochemical and climatological data from 200 to 2015, fresh SGD-derived dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is found to be a significant regulator of the annual cycle of phytoplankton community structure in the harbour. In the wet season, fresh SGD supplies nutrients with NH4+:NO3- ratio <  to the seawater, meanwhile creates an intensive vertical stratification environment. As a result, diatom which is a NO3- specialist, is prone to be the major group in the harbour. Fresh SGD delivers a same orders of magnitude of DIN as river and precipitation, but it is more important to phytoplankton community structure dynamics because fresh groundwater has smaller NH4+:NO3- ratio that significantly changes the ratio in the harbour. In the dry season, with the decline of fresh SGD and the ease of stratification, vertical mixing uplifts the nutrient (NH4+:NO3- ratio > 1) released from the bottom sediment leading to a NH4+ dominant environment in water column. Dinoflagellate and other groups then become dominant species of phytoplankton in the harbour. Fresh SGD has a major influence on the NH4+:NO3- ratio in the seawater compared to tide-driven SGD, even though the latter contributes a larger proportion SGD. Tide-driven SGD also produces NH4+ and NO3-, but NH4+:NO3- ratio are mainly subject to the beach environment (bare/mangrove beach), which does not change much seasonally, thus dominant DIN species do not change significantly throughout a year. In a conclusion, fresh SGD plays the most important role among all the endmembers in regulating the DIN composition in Tolo Harbour and its fluctuation mediates the phytoplankton community structure.",2020-02-10,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134897,134897,134897,703,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2988178765,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134897,journal-article,2988178765

This model considers the ankle plantarflexors to act as a single synergistic group. There are differences in muscle properties among the medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG, respectively) and the soleus that may affect their activation. Twelve volunteers participated in an investigation to determine whether the activation of the ankle plantarflexor muscles was modulated according to perturbation direction during unilateral standing perturbations of 1% body mass. High-density surface electromyography (HDS-EMG) was used to determine the amplitude and barycenter of the muscle activation and kinematic analysis was used to evaluate ankle, knee, and hip joint movement. The HDS-EMG amplitude and barycenter of MG and LG were modulated with the perturbation direction (MG p < 0.05; LG p < 0.01; one-way repeated-measures ANOVA). In soleus, the HDS-EMG barycenter modulated across the perturbation direction (p < 0.0 for X&Y coordinates), but the HDS-EMG amplitude did not change. A repeated-measures correlation was used to interpret the HDS-EMG pattern in the context of the kinematics. The relative contribution of MG activation compared to the total gastrocnemii activation was significantly associated with ankle dorsi/plantarflexion (rrm = 0.620), knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.62 and rrm = 0.547, respectively), and hip flexion/extension and abduction/adduction (rrm = 0.65 and rrm = 0.432, respectively).

We intended to apportion resting-state dysconnectivity into components that represent genetic diathesis, clinical expression or treatment effect, and resilience. Methods: fMRI data were acquired from 28 schizophrenia patients, 28 unaffected siblings, and 6 healthy controls. Based on Dosenbach’s atlas, we extracted time series of 16 regions of interest. After constructing functional network, we investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity and topological properties of undirected graphs. Results: Using analysis of variance, we found 8 dysconnectivities. Post hoc t tests revealed that 62.5% were associated with genetic diathesis and 21.6% were associated with clinical expression. Topologically, we observed increased degree, clustering coefficient, and global efficiency in the sibling group compared to both patients and controls. Conclusion: A large portion of the resting-state functional dysconnectivity seen in patients represents a genetic diathesis effect. The most prominent network-level disruption is the dysconnectivity among nodes of the default mode and salience networks.

In this model, the actual control volume was divided into several sub-grids characterized by different characteristic particle sizes, and the total drag force was obtained by summing all the sub-grids drag forces. To obtain the slip velocity for each sub-grid separately, the widely-used Richardson-Zaki (R-Z) equation was introduced into each sub-grid. The simulation results showed that this model can more accurately predict the average solids holdup than other models, as well as the axial solids holdup distribution. Also, the axial pressure and pressure gradient distribution were given, and the unique flow pattern in the downer can be clearly captured.

An important reason for this complexity is the large variation in shade tolerance among different tree species. At present, we lack a clear understanding of which plant traits control this variation, e.g., regarding the relative contributions of whole-plant versus leaf traits or structural versus physiological traits. We investigated a broad range of traits in six tropical montane rainforest tree species with different degrees of shade tolerance, grown under three different radiation regimes (under the open sky or beneath sparse or dense canopies). The two distinct shade-tolerant species had higher fractional biomass in leaves and branches while shade-intolerant species invested more into stems, and these differences were greater under low radiation. Leaf respiration and photosynthetic light compensation point did not vary with species shade tolerance, regardless of radiation regime. Leaf temperatures in open plots were markedly higher in shade-tolerant species due to their low transpiration rates and large leaf sizes. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in shade tolerance of tropical montane trees is controlled by species differences in whole-plant biomass allocation strategy rather than by difference in physiological leaf traits determining leaf carbon balance at low radiation.",2020-02-20,Tree Physiology,https://openalex.org/V147008614,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpz119,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995629255,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpz119,journal-article,2995629255

Using human bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs as a gold standard, we used label-free mass spectrometry and functional assays to characterize the proteome, secretome, and corresponding function of human pancreas-derived MSCs (Panc-MSCs) with a classical phenotype (CD90+/CD73+/CD105+/CD45−/CD31−). Both MSC subtypes expressed mesenchymal markers vimentin, α-SMA, and STRO-1; however, expression of nestin was increased in Panc-MSCs. Accordingly, these Vimentinhigh/Nestinhigh cells were isolated from fresh human pancreatic islet and non-islet tissues. Next, we identified expression of &amp;gt;60 CD markers shared between Panc-MSCs and BM-MSCs, including validated expression of CD14. An additional 19 CD markers were differentially expressed, including reduced pericyte-marker CD14 expression on Panc-MSCs. Panc-MSCs also showed reduced expression of proteins involved in lipid and retinoid metabolism. Accordingly, Panc-MSCs showed restricted responses to adipogenic stimuli in vitro, although both MSC types demonstrated trilineage differentiation. In contrast, Panc-MSCs demonstrated accelerated growth kinetics and competency to pro-neurogenic stimuli in vitro. The secretome of Panc-MSCs was highly enriched for proteins associated with vascular development, wound healing and chemotaxis. Similar to BM-MSCs, Panc-MSCs conditioned media augmented endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and tubule formation in vitro. Importantly, the secretome of both MSC types was capable of stimulating chemotactic infiltration of murine endothelial cells in vivo and reduced hyperglycemia in STZ-treated mice following intrapancreatic injection. Overall, this study provides foundational knowledge to develop Panc-MSCs as a unique MSC subtype with functional properties beneficial in regenerative medicine for diabetes and vascular disease.",2020-05-01,Stem Cells,https://openalex.org/V65139510,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3143,666,682,38,5,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997503540,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3143,journal-article,2997503540

Research must explore critical reflection in practice and how it is developed. In this study, we explored what critical reflection consisted of in a context known for indeterminacy, and to what sources participants attributed their critically reflective insights and approaches. Methods The study context was the interface between health care and education for children with chronic conditions or disabilities necessitating health-related recommendations and supports (eg accommodations or equipment) at school. We conducted a secondary analysis of 42 interview transcripts from an institutional ethnographic study involving health professionals, school-based educators and parents of children with chronic conditions or disabilities. We coded all transcripts for instances of critical reflection, moments that seemed to lack but could benefit from critical reflection, and participant-attributed sources of critically reflective insights. Results Critically reflective practice involved getting to know the other, valuing and leveraging different forms and sources of knowledge, identifying and communicating workarounds (ie strategies to circumvent imperfect systems), seeing inequities, and advocating as collaborators, not adversaries. Participants invariably attributed critically reflective insights to personal experiences such as former careers or close personal relationships. Conclusions This study shows that personal experiences and connections inspire critically reflective views, and that being critically reflective is not a binary trait possessed (or not) by individuals.

We observed increased CD117+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow of SUM159 mice versus MCF7 or control mice (p &lt; 0.05). Relative to mice bearing MCF7 tumors and non-tumor controls, mice bearing SUM159 tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of ECM proteins in the lung (fibronectin, tenascin-c and periostin), with similar changes observed in lung fibroblasts treated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) from TN breast cancer cells (p &lt; 0.05).

Traditional teaching has relied on the use of cadavers; however, this method is resource-intensive and does not allow for repeated practice. Virtual reality surgical training is a growing field that is increasingly being adopted in Otolaryngology. CardinalSim is a virtual reality temporal bone surgical simulator that offers a high-quality, inexpensive adjunct to traditional teaching methods. The objective of this study was to establish the face and content validity of CardinalSim through a national study. Methods Otolaryngologists and resident trainees from across Canada were recruited to evaluate CardinalSim. Ethics approval and informed consent was obtained. A face and content validity questionnaire with questions categorized into 1 domains was distributed to participants following simulator use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe questionnaire results, and either Chi-square or Fishers exact tests were used to compare responses between junior residents, senior residents, and practising surgeons. Results Sixty-two participants from thirteen different Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery programs were included in the study (3 practicing surgeons; 3 resident trainees).

However, to date, the upstream guanylyl cyclase (GC) subtype eliciting cGMP production is unknown. Here, we show that mice with a genetic disruption of the gene encoding the cGMP generator GC-A, the receptor for atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides, display a greater vulnerability of hair cells to hidden hearing loss and noise- and age-dependent hearing loss. This vulnerability was associated with GC-A expression in spiral ganglia and outer hair cells (OHCs) but not in inner hair cells (IHCs). GC-A knockout mice exhibited elevated hearing thresholds, most pronounced for the detection of high-frequency tones. Deficits in OHC input-output functions in high-frequency regions were already present in young GC-A-deficient mice, with no signs of an accelerated progression of age-related hearing loss or higher vulnerability to acoustic trauma. OHCs in these frequency regions in young GC-A knockout mice exhibited diminished levels of KCNQ4 expression, which is the dominant K+ channel in OHCs, and decreased activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, an enzyme involved in DNA repair. Further, GC-A knockout mice had IHC synapse impairments and reduced amplitudes of auditory brainstem responses that progressed with age and with acoustic trauma, in contrast to OHCs, when compared to GC-A wild-type littermates. We conclude that GC-A/cGMP-dependent signaling pathways have otoprotective functions and GC-A gene disruption differentially contributes to hair-cell damage in a healthy, aged, or injured system.

Drawing on a large sample of Internet users from 53 different countries (N = 31,391, 35% female, Mage = 28.64, SD = 10.98), multilevel modelling was used to examine whether there was significant between-country variability on grandiose narcissism.

Within countries, younger individuals, as well as men, were more narcissistic. Between countries, those with better social progress (e.g., meeting basic human needs) had lower aggregate narcissism scores. The other predictors correlated strongly with social progress and did not account for unique variance.

Since osteoclasts are responsible for bone destruction adjacent to rheumatoid synovium, profiling osteoclasts from circulating precursors in RA could help identify patients at risk for bone destruction. In this study, we sought to determine whether the functional characteristics of osteoclasts generated from their blood precursors were modified by RA activity or were intrinsic to osteoclasts and associated with the RA phenotype (erosive or not). Osteoclasts were generated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects with RA (n = 140), as well as sex- and age-matched healthy controls (n = 101). Osteoclastic parameters were analyzed at baseline and during the follow-up for up to 4 years, with regular assessment of RA activity, bone erosions, and bone mineral density (BMD). As a validation cohort, we examined RA patients from the Early Undifferentiated PolyArthritis (EUPA) study (n = 163). The proportion of CD14+ PBMC was higher in RA than in control subjects, but inversely correlated with the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28). Also surprisingly, in osteoclast cultures from PBMCs, active RA was associated with lower osteoclastogenic capacity, while in vitro bone resorption per osteoclast and resistance to apoptosis were similar in both active and quiescent RA. In a small subgroup analysis, osteoclasts from subjects with recent RA that had progressed at four years to an erosive RA exhibited at baseline greater resistance to apoptosis than those from patients remaining non-erosive.

Drawing on a study exploring how person and place transact to shape older adults’ social connectedness, inclusion and engagement in neighbourhoods, this paper explores how older adults take action in efforts to create neighbourhoods that meet individual and collective needs and wants. We drew on ethnographic and community-based participatory approaches and employed qualitative and geospatial methods with 14 older adults in two neighbourhoods. Analysis identified three themes that described the ways that older adults enact agency at the neighbourhood level: being present and inviting casual social interaction , helping others and taking community action . The participants appeared to contribute to a collective sense of connectedness and creation of social spaces doing everyday neighbourhood activities and interacting with others. Shared territories in which others were present seemed to support such interactions. Participants also helped others in a variety of ways, often relating to gaps in services and support, becoming neighbourhood-based supports for other seniors. Finally, participants contributed to change at the community level, such as engaging politically, patronising local businesses and making improvements in public places.

The present study replicated the three-dimensional factor structure of the STCI in China using 60 items consistent with other standard trait versions (e.g., English, Chilean-Spanish). Closer examination of associations between traits suggested bad mood showed curvilinear associations with both cheerfulness and seriousness, such that cheerfulness and bad mood were negatively associated for those low and average in trait bad mood but not for those with high trait bad mood. Seriousness was positively associated with bad mood at high levels of trait bad mood, but not at average or low levels of bad mood. Associations between the STCI traits and major personality dimensions, humour styles, and well-being were further examined. Cheerfulness and seriousness showed positive associations with satisfaction with life and emotional well-being (EWB) while bad mood showed a curvilinear association with EWB.

Results We find no differences in physical health for gay men and lesbian women compared with their heterosexual counterparts. However, middle-aged gay men are disadvantaged in terms of mental health, but not women. Bisexual women are disadvantaged in terms of physical health, and for mental health in some model specifications. Respondents who did not their sexual orientation have poorer health across some measures of health and age groups. Discussion Our findings add to the paucity of research on older sexual minorities in Canada. They highlight the importance of separating out sexual minority groups because bisexual women have distinct health profiles.

This is accomplished in part by the accumulation of cryoprotectant glucose, metabolic rate depression, and stress response activation. These may be achieved by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which is typically associated with transcriptional repression. Hyperglycemia is also associated with modifications to epigenetic profiles, indicating an additional role that the high levels of glucose play in freeze tolerance. We sought to determine whether DNA methylation is affected during freezing exposure, and whether this is due to the wood frog’s response to hyperglycemia. We examined global DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the liver and muscle of frozen and glucose-loaded wood frogs. The results showed that levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) increased in the muscle, suggesting elevated DNA methylation during freezing. DNMT activities also decreased in muscle during thawing, glucose loading, and in vitro glucose experiments. Liver DNMT activities were similar to muscle; however, a varied response to DNMT levels and a decrease in 5mC highlight the metabolic role the liver plays during freezing. Glucose was also shown to decrease DNMT activity levels in the wood frog, in vitro, elucidating a potentially novel regulatory mechanism.

Here, we employed chronologically aged yeast cells to investigate how activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affects lifespan. We found that cells lacking a functional UPR display a significantly reduced chronological lifespan, which contrasts previous findings in models of replicative aging. We find exacerbated UPR activation in aged cells, indicating an increase in misfolded protein burden in the ER during the course of aging. We also observed that caloric restriction, which promotes longevity in various model organisms, extends lifespan of UPR-deficient strains. Similarly, aging in pH-buffered media extends lifespan, albeit independently of the UPR. Thus, our data support a role for caloric restriction and reduced acid stress in improving ER homeostasis during aging. Finally, we show that UPR-mediated upregulation of the ER chaperone Kar2 and functional ER-associated degradation (ERAD) are essential for proper aging. Our work documents the central role of secretory protein homeostasis in chronological aging in yeast and highlights that the requirement for a functional UPR can differ between post-mitotic and actively dividing eukaryotic cells.",2020-02-01,Current Genetics,https://openalex.org/V56878690,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-019-01019-0,263,277,66,1,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962903111,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-019-01019-0,journal-article,2962903111

Allodynography has been proposed as a useful standardized procedure for clinical assessment of mechanical allodynia. This study (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02070367) undertook preliminary investigation of the measurement properties of allodynography, a new standardized clinical examination procedure for mapping the area of cutaneous allodynia. Methods Persons with pain in one upper extremity after complex regional pain syndrome, a peripheral nerve injury, or who had recently experienced a hand fracture were recruited for assessment of static mechanical allodynia (based on perception of a 15g force stimulus delivered by Semmes-Weinstein monofilament #5.18 as painful) by two raters at baseline; the assessment was repeated one week later. Results Single-measures estimates suggested inter-rater reliability for allodynography was excellent at an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.9 (N = 12); test–retest reliability was also excellent at ICC = 0.8 (N = 10) for allodynography (P &amp;lt; 0.00 for both). Confidence intervals’ lower bounds confirm inter-rater reliability as excellent (0.90) but were less definitive for test–retest (0.59). Conclusions This preliminary study supports the inter-rater and test–retest reliability of allodynography.

Congenital beta cell-specific IR knockout (βIRKO) mouse studies have demonstrated the development of age-dependent glucose intolerance. We investigated the role of beta cell IR signalling specifically during postnatal life following undisturbed prenatal pancreatic development and maturation. We utilized a tamoxifen-inducible mouse insulin  promoter (MIP) driven Cre recombinase IR knockout mouse model (MIP-βIRKO) to achieve partial knockout of IR in islets and determine the functional role of beta cell IR in adult mice fed a control normal diet (ND) or 60% high-fat diet (HFD). At 2 weeks of age, MIP-βIRKO ND mice maintained glucose tolerance, insulin release, and unchanged beta cell mass when compared to control ND mice. In contrast, 24-week-old MIP-βIRKO mice demonstrated significant glucose intolerance and lower insulin release after 1 weeks of HFD feeding. A reduction in beta cell soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein expression, phosphorylated AktS473 and P70S6K1T389, and glucose transporter  (GLUT2) expression were also identified in MIP-βIRKO HFD islets. Overall, the postnatal knockout of beta cell IR in HFD-fed mice resulted in decreased expression of beta cell glucose-sensing and exocytotic proteins and a reduction in intracellular signalling.

However, the hypothesis is still controversial and relies on studies using indirect contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) methods. METHODS We studied how hyperinsulinemia effects capillary blood flow in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp using intravital video microscopy (IVVM). Additionally, we modeled blood flow and microbubble distribution within the vascular tree under conditions observed during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments. RESULTS Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia caused an increase in erythrocyte (80 ± 25%, P < .01) and plasma (53 ± 12%, P < .01) flow in rat EDL microvasculature. We found no evidence of de novo capillary recruitment within, or among, capillary networks supplied by different terminal arterioles; however, erythrocyte flow became slightly more homogenous. Our computational model predicts that a decrease in asymmetry at arteriolar bifurcations causes redistribution of microbubble flow among capillaries already perfused with erythrocytes and plasma, resulting in 25% more microbubbles flowing through capillaries. CONCLUSIONS Our model suggests increase in CEU signal during hyperinsulinemia reflects a redistribution of arteriolar flow and not de novo capillary recruitment.

Multi-objective optimizations were carried out for three cases with various objective functions, decision variables and constraints. It was found that, for a given SSMB unit, there exist a Pareto curve when product purity and unit throughput are simultaneously maximized with practical constraint on recovery. The corresponding values of flowrate ratio, however, exhibit some trends different from those of conventional Simulated Moving Bed (SMB). Analyses on component mass flow and dimensional operating parameters reveal that these differences can be attributed to the fact that the three sub-steps with different durations and flow patterns have their individual functional roles.

To develop improved cell culture models for studying adipogenesis, the current study examines the proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) on a range of ECM-derived coatings. Human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) and commercially available bovine tendon collagen (COL) are digested with α-amylase or pepsin to prepare the coatings. Physical characterization demonstrates that α-amylase digestion generates softer, thicker, and more stable coatings, with a fibrous tissue-like ultrastructure that is lost in the pepsin-digested thin films. ASCs cultured on the α-amylase-digested ECM have a more spindle-shaped morphology, and proliferation is significantly enhanced on the α-amylase-digested DAT coatings. Further, the α-amylase-digested DAT provides a more pro-adipogenic microenvironment, based on higher levels of adipogenic gene expression, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, and perilipin staining. Overall, this study supports α-amylase digestion as a new approach for generating bioactive ECM-derived coatings, and demonstrates tissue-specific bioactivity using adipose-derived ECM to enhance ASC proliferation and adipogenic differentiation.",2020-03-01,Biotechnology Journal,https://openalex.org/V31411064,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201900118,1900118,1900118,15,3,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982524764,https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201900118,journal-article,2982524764

A series of experiments are reported in which memory for multiple olfactory discriminations was measured in dogs, rats, and humans. Participants from all three species learned a sequence of 20 different discriminations between an S + odor and an S- odor. Choice of the S+ odor was rewarded with food for dogs and rats and with positive verbal feedback for humans. After learning the discriminations, an initial memory test was given that involved presentation of all 20 S + and S- pairs. A subsequent mix-and-match test was given in which each S + odor was presented with three different S- odors. The memory tests revealed that dogs were superior to rats and that dogs and rats were superior to humans. The relatively poor performance of humans contrasts with prior findings of high recognition memory for odors followed by slow forgetting. We attribute the low accuracy of humans in our experiments to the requirement that participants had to remember the outcome associated with S + (correct) and S- (incorrect) cues and not just their familiarity.

Our objective was to assess the longitudinal associations of soluble CD163 (sCD163), a novel biomarker of ATM activation, with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and dysglycemia in high-risk subjects. Methods Adults at risk for type 2 diabetes in the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) study had  assessments over  years (n = 408). Levels of sCD163 were measured using fasting serum. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by HOMA2-%S and the Matsuda index (ISI). β-cell function was determined by insulinogenic index (IGI) over HOMA-IR and insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2). Incident dysglycemia was defined as the onset of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) evaluated longitudinal associations of sCD163 with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and incident dysglycemia adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AROC) tested whether sCD163 improved dysglycemia prediction in a clinical model. Results Longitudinal analyses showed significant inverse associations between sCD163 and insulin sensitivity (% difference per standard deviation increase of sCD163 for HOMA2-%S (β = −7.01; 95% CI, −12.26 to −1.44) and ISI (β = −7.60; 95% CI, −11.09 to −3.97) and β-cell function (ISSI-2 (β = −4.67; 9 %CI, −8.59 to −0.58) and IGI/HOMA-IR (β = −8.75; 95% CI, −15.42 to −1.56)). Increased sCD163 was associated with greater risk for incident dysglycemia (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; P &amp;lt; 0.001). Adding sCD163 data to a model with clinical variables improved prediction of incident dysglycemia (AROC=0.6731 vs 0.638; P &amp;lt; 0.05).

Therefore, we aimed to accelerate single breath-hold 3D multi-b diffusion-weighted 129 Xe MRI, using k-space undersampling in imaging direction using a different undersampling pattern for different b-values combined with the stretched exponential model to generate maps of ventilation, apparent transverse relaxation time constant ( T2∗ ), ADC, and Lm values in a single, short breath-hold; accelerated and non-accelerated measurements were directly compared. METHODS We evaluated multi-b (0, 12, 20, 30, and 45.5 s/cm2 ) diffusion-weighted 129 Xe T2∗ /ADC/morphometry estimates using acceleration factor (AF =  and 7) and multi-breath sampling in  volunteers (HV), and  participants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).

The therapeutic efficacy for allergic diseases is unsatisfactory currently. This study aims to regulate the skewed Th2 response with CARsomes. Methods The CARsome consisted of an epitope of Dermatophagoides farina-1 (Derf1), a segment of the anti-DEC205 antibody, the scFv, and an open reading frame of perforin. This fusion protein binds to DEC205 molecule on the surface of exosomes derived from dendritic cells (DC). The effects of CARsome on inducing antigen (Ag)-specific Th2 cell apoptosis were assessed both in vivo and in vitro. Results Exposure to CARsomes in the culture induced Ag-specific Th2 cell apoptosis. Injection of CARsomes through the vein puncture also induced Ag-specific Th2 cell apoptosis in the lungs of sensitized mice. CARsomes could induce Ag-specific regulatory T cells.

This photodissociation region (PDR) exhibits intense extended red emission (ERE) attributed to fluorescence by large molecules/ions. We detected strong diffuse interstellar bands (DIB) in the stellar spectrum, including an exceptionally strong and broad DIB at $\lambda$4428. The detection of strong DIBs in association with ERE could be consistent with the suggestion that the carriers of DIBs and ERE are identical. The likely ERE process is recurrent fluorescence, enabled by inverse internal conversions from highly excited vibrational levels of the ground state to low-lying electronic states with subsequent transitions to ground. This provides a path to rapid radiative cooling for molecules/molecular ions, greatly enhancing their ability to survive in a strongly irradiated environment. The ratio of the equivalent widths (EW) of DIBs $\lambda$579 and $\lambda$578 in IC 63 is the same as that observed in the low-density interstellar medium with UV interstellar radiation fields (ISRF) weaker by at least two orders of magnitude. This falsifies suggestions that the ratio of these two DIBs can serve as a measure of the UV strength of the ISRF. Observations of the nebular spectrum of the PDR of IC 63 at locations immediately adjacent to where DIBs were detected failed to reveal any presence of sharp emission features seen in the spectrum of the Red Rectangle nebula. This casts doubts upon proposals that the carriers of these features are the same as those of DIBs seen at slightly shorter wavelengths.",2020-03-11,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa223,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998847489,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa223,journal-article,2998847489

The study also examined the effect of ovarian stimulation on uterine luminal closure and uterine receptivity on D4 of pregnancy and embryo implantation on D and D of pregnancy. These analyses revealed that the expression of Aqp3, Aqp4, Aqp5 and Aqp8 is induced by E2 while the expression of Aqp1 and Aqp11 is induced by P4. Additionally, P4 inhibits E2 induction of Aqp and Aq expression while E2 inhibits Aqp1 and Aqp11 expression. Aqp9, however, is constitutively expressed. Ovarian stimulation disrupts Aqp3, Aqp5 and Aqp8 expression on D4 and AQP1, AQP and AQP spatial expression on both D and D4, strikingly so in the myometrium. Interestingly, while ovarian stimulation has no overt effect on luminal closure and uterine receptivity, it reduces implantation events, likely through a disruption in myometrial activity and embryo development. The wider implication of this study is that ovarian stimulation, which results in supraphysiological levels of E2 and P4 and changes (depending on the degree of stimulation) in the E2:P4 ratio, triggers abnormal expression of uterine AQP during pregnancy, and this is associated with implantation failure. These findings lead us to recognize that abnormal expression would also occur under any pathological state (such as endometriosis) that is associated with changes in the normal E2:P4 ratio. Thus, infertility among these patients might in part be linked to abnormal uterine AQP expression.",2020-03-26,Molecular human reproduction,https://openalex.org/V4210190516,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa007,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999907226,https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa007,journal-article,2999907226

Research is needed that identifies area-level characteristics that can inform strategies for reducing unmet need in the population. The study purpose is to: (1) estimate area-level variation in children’s unmet need for mental health services (using Service Areas as defined by the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services), and (2) identify area-level service arrangements, and geographic and population characteristics associated with unmet need. Using individual-level general population data, area-level government administrative data and Census data from Ontario, Canada, we use multilevel regression models to analyze unmet need for mental health services among children (level 1) nested within Service Areas (level 2). The study finds that 1.64% of the reliable variance in unmet need for mental health services is attributable to between-area differences. Across areas, we find that Service Areas with more agencies had a lower likelihood of unmet need for mental health services. Compared to other Service Areas, Toronto had much lower likelihood of unmet need compared to the rest of Ontario. Rural areas, areas with unsatisfactory public transport, and areas with higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage had a higher likelihood of unmet need for mental health services.

Our hypothesis is that proteins that associate with glucagon within alpha cell secretory granules will regulate glucagon secretion, and may provide druggable targets for controlling abnormal glucagon secretion in diabetes. Recently, we identified a dynamic glucagon interactome within the secretory granules of the α cell line, αTC1-6, and showed that select proteins within the interactome could modulate glucagon secretion. In the present study, we show that one of these interactome proteins, the neuronal protein stathmin-2, is expressed in αTC1-6 cells and in mouse pancreatic alpha cells, and is a novel regulator of glucagon secretion. The secretion of both glucagon and Stmn2 was significantly enhanced in response to 55 mM K+, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed co-localization of stathmin-2 with glucagon and the secretory granule markers chromogranin A and VAMP-2 in αTC1-6 cells. In mouse pancreatic islets, Stathmin-2 co-localized with glucagon, but not with insulin, and co-localized with secretory pathway markers. To show a function for stathmin-2 in regulating glucagon secretion, we showed that siRNA-mediated depletion of stathmin-2 in αTC1-6 cells caused glucagon secretion to become constitutive without any effect on proglucagon mRNA levels, while overexpression of stathmin-2 completely abolished both basal and K+-stimulated glucagon secretion. Overexpression of stathmin-2 increased the localization of glucagon into the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, while depletion of stathmin-2 reduced the endosomal localization of glucagon. Therefore, we describe stathmin-2 as having a novel role as an alpha cell secretory granule protein that modulates glucagon secretion via trafficking through the endosomal-lysosomal system. These findings describe a potential new pathway for the regulation of glucagon secretion, and may have implications for controlling glucagon hypersecretion in diabetes.",2020-02-04,Frontiers in Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V2597401208,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00029,,,11,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003189257,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00029,journal-article,3003189257

Electrical storm is most frequently defined as a cluster of ≥3 episodes of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in a 24-h period. This definition has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, but the effect of lesser and greater clustering of arrhythmias has not been described. Among all patients in the Resynchronization in Ambulatory Heart Failure trial, 14,515 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator–detected events with data available were rigorously adjudicated in blinded fashion. Arrhythmia incidence was examined for clustering, defined as 2 or more VA events occurring within 3 months. The prognostic importance of clustering was analyzed by varying the cluster length and number of events used to define a cluster. Mortality rates of groups with clustered arrhythmias were compared to patients with no arrhythmia or with unclustered arrhythmia. The trial included 1,764 patients, among whom 46 patients had two or more VA episodes within 3 months, whereas 40 had unclustered arrhythmias. Compared to patients with no arrhythmia, patients experiencing unclustered VA had increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 1.93; p = 0.011), whereas the risk was even higher in patients with clustered arrhythmia (HR: 2.68; 95% CI: 2.13 to 3.36; p < 0.0001). Mortality risk increased with higher VA burden (number of VAs in a cluster) and shorter cluster length. This was observed in all groups tested, including the cluster with the least VA burden in the longest cluster length tested (2 VA episodes occurring within 3 months) (mortality HR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.9 to 4.17; p < 0.0001).

First, we selected the most responsive questions within each of the domains. Internal validity of the NBSS-SF was assessed using Cronbach's α. External validity was assessed by evaluating hypothesized relationships with other questionnaires and testing correlations with the full NBSS domains. Test-retest reliability of the NBSS-SF domains was determined using an intraclass coefficient (ICC).Using data from a prior responsiveness study, we selected questions for the NBSS-SF from the incontinence domain (three), storage/voiding domain (three), consequences domain (two); these would make up the NBSS-SF. We used the original NBSS validation cohort of 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), or spina bifida, and found the Cronbach's α was .76 for the NBSS-SF; the external validity was high, with correlations between specific NBSS-SF domains/total scores and the Qualiveen-SF, ICIQ, and AUASS generally similar to those seen with the NBSS. Correlations between the NBSS-SF domains and the full NBSS domains were high. The NBSS-SF ICC in a subset of 12 patients was 0.84. The NBSS-SF performed similarly in two additional independent datasets.The total score of the NBSS-SF has appropriate validity, reliability, and could be used instead of the full NBSS to minimize the assessment burden.

The response of the respective MLT regions to three SSW events that occurred during 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2011–12 winters are investigated. SSW signatures in the MLT zonal and meridional winds over the high latitude station Andenes ($$69.3^\circ\, \mathrm{N}, 16.0^\circ\, \mathrm{E}$$) are found to have significant differences from event to event. Mean wind reversals in the high latitude MLT are found to be preceding the corresponding signatures at $$60^\circ\, \mathrm{N}$$, 10 hPa by a few days. Zonal and meridional wind reversals extend to the MLT region over the mid latitude location Socorro ($$34.1^\circ\, \mathrm{N}, 106.9^\circ\, \mathrm{W}$$). However, MLT region over the low latitude station Thumba ($$8.5^\circ\, \mathrm{N}, 77^\circ\, \mathrm{E}$$) as well as the equatorial station Kototabang ($$0.2^\circ\, \mathrm{S}, 100.3^\circ\, \mathrm{E}$$) are found to be having a minimal response as far as mean winds are concerned. Apart from mean winds, planetary wave activity in the MLT region over the observational sites are examined, which show a systematic progression of planetary waves from high to equatorial latitudes during major as well as minor SSW events. To elucidate the origin of the observed planetary waves in the MLT region, the stratospheric winds are analyzed. Results suggest that the observed planetary waves have originated in the high-mid latitude middle atmospheric region. The present study provides observational evidence for secondary planetary wave generation in the high-mid latitude middle atmosphere and their equatorial propagation in the MLT as predicted by previous numerical modelling studies. Significance of the present study lies in employing a network of meteor radar observations to investigate the SSW signatures in the MLT region over high, middle, low and equatorial latitudes, simultaneously.",2020-03-19,Climate Dynamics,https://openalex.org/V93478396,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05214-5,,,,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012196531,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05214-5,journal-article,3012196531

This review focuses on pediatric dyslipidemias excluding familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), but including both severe and mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia, combined hyperlipidemia, and elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. We suggest that for Canadian children and adolescents with dyslipidemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment should include both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride measurement. To further stratify risk, determination of non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is recommended, for both its ability to predict ASCVD and convenience for the patient because fasting is not required. Similarly, apolipoprotein B measurement (fasting or nonfasting), where available, can be helpful. Lp(a) measurement should not be routine in childhood, but it can be considered in special circumstances. After ruling out secondary causes, the foundation for management of pediatric dyslipidemia includes weight regulation, optimizing diet, and increasing activity level. At present, randomized clinical trial data to guide pharmaceutical management of pediatric hypertriglyceridemia or other non-FH pediatric dyslipidemias are scarce.

This is largely related to increased recognition and improved techniques for treating femoroacetabilar impingement (FAI). Though hip arthroscopy generally yields favorable outcomes, there are a subset of patients who have residual or recurrent symptoms that require reoperation. The current review discusses an algorithmic approach to evaluating patients following a failed hip arthroscopy including a framework for clinical and radiographic assessment, available treatment options, and associated outcomes in revision surgery.Residual FAI has been demonstrated to be the most common indication for revision arthroscopy. Other indications include residual or recurrent labral pathology, gross instability, microinstability, or adhesions. Appropriate history and imaging are important to determine the cause for residual symptoms. Novel techniques including labral and capsular reconstruction, and modified remplissage procedures have been developed to deal with complex revision cases. Though studies have shown improved outcomes after revision surgery, they have been shown to result in inferior outcomes compared to a matched cohort following primary hip arthroscopy. Management of a failed hip arthroscopy remains a complex problem. Focused history, cross-sectional imaging, and revision hip arthroscopy with novel techniques can improve outcomes, albeit to a lesser extent than patients undergoing successful primary hip arthroscopy.

Nevertheless, a recent analysis of Haematococcus lacustris revealed exactly that. A common repeat element has proliferated throughout the mtDNA and ptDNA of this chlamydomonadalean green alga, resulting in the unprecedented situation whereby these two distinct organelle genomes are largely made up of nearly identical sequences. In this short update to the work on H. lacustris, I highlight another chlamydomonadalean species (Stephanosphaera pluvialis) for which matching repeats have spread throughout its organelle genomes (but to a lesser degree than in H. lacustris). What's more, the organelle repeats from S. pluvialis are similar to those from H. lacustris, suggesting that they have a shared origin, and perhaps existed in the mtDNA and ptDNA of the most recent common ancestor of these two species. However, my examination of organelle genomes from other close relatives of H. lacustris and S. pluvialis did not uncover further compelling examples of common organelle repeat elements, meaning that the evolutionary history of these repeats might be more complicated than initially thought.",2020-05-12,Frontiers in Genetics,https://openalex.org/V2597340651,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00465,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024136660,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00465,journal-article,3024136660

Our 7.5 year survey consists of an integrated time-area product of $\sim$ 7$\times$ 10$^6$ km$^2$ hours. Selecting just over 16000 six station meteor echoes having the highest measured velocity accuracy from within our sample, we found five candidate interstellar events. These five potential interstellar meteoroids were found to be hyperbolic at the 2$\sigma$-level using only their raw measured speed. Applying a new atmospheric deceleration correction algorithm developed for CMOR, we show that all five candidate events were likely hyperbolic at better than 3$\sigma$, the most significant being a 3.7$\sigma$ detection. Assuming all five detections are true interstellar meteoroids, we estimate the interstellar meteoroid flux at Earth to be at least 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ meteoroids/km$^{2}$/hr appropriate to a mass of  $\times$ 10$^{-7}$kg. Using estimated measurement uncertainties directly extracted from CMOR data, we simulated CMOR's ability to detect a hypothetical 'Oumuamua - associated hyperbolic meteoroid stream. Such a stream was found to be significant at the 1.8$\sigma$ level, suggesting that CMOR would likely detect such a stream of meteoroids as hyperbolic.

We compared classifications obtained from a commonly used measure (Statistics Canada standard) with those obtained by two direct questions—whether one is a member of a visible minority group and whether one is perceived or treated as a person of colour. A mixed-methods analysis was conducted using data from an English-language online survey (n = 311) and cognitive interviews with a maximum diversity subsample (n = 79). Participants were Canadian residents age 14 and older. Agreement between the single visible minority item and the standard was good (Cohen’s Κ = 0.725; 95% CI = 0.629, 0.820). However, participants understood “visible minority” in different and often literal ways, sometimes including those living with visible disabilities or who were visibly transgender or poor. Agreement between the single person of colour item and the standard was very good (Κ = 0.830; 95% CI = 0.747, 0.913). “Person of colour” was more clearly understood to reflect ethnoracial background and may better capture the group likely to be targeted for racism than the Statistics Canada standard. When Indigenous participants who reported being persons of colour were reclassified to reflect the government definition of visible minority as non-Indigenous, this measure had strong agreement with the current federal standard measure (K = 0.851; 95% CI = 0.772, 0.930).

Strategies for HIV-1 cure have largely focused on latency reversing agents (LRAs) capable of reactivating and eliminating this viral reservoir. Previously investigated LRAs have largely failed to achieve a robust latency reversal sufficient for reduction of latent HIV pool or the potential of virus-free remission in the absence of treatment. <h3>Methods</h3> We utilize a polyvalent virus-like particle (VLP) formulation called Activator Vector (ACT-VEC) to ‘shock' provirus into transcriptional activity. <i>Ex vivo</i> co-culture experiments were used to evaluate the efficacy of ACT-VEC in relation to other LRAs in individuals diagnosed and treated during the acute stage of infection. IFN-γ ELISpot, qRT-PCR and Illumina MiSeq were used to evaluate antigenicity, latency reversal, and diversity of induced virus respectively. <h3>Findings</h3> Using samples from HIV<sup>+</sup> patients diagnosed and treated at acute/early infection, we demonstrate that ACT-VEC can reverse latency in HIV infected CD4 T cells to a greater extent than other major recall antigens as stimuli or even mitogens such as PMA/Iono. Furthermore, ACT-VEC activates more latent HIV-1 than clinically tested HDAC inhibitors or protein kinase C agonists. <h3>Interpretation</h3> Taken together, these results show that ACT-VEC can induce HIV reactivation from latently infected CD4 T cells collected from participants on first line combined antiretroviral therapy for at least two years after being diagnosed and treated at acute/early stage of infection.

Using the soft-threshold denoising method in the wavelet domain with experimental empty bed signals as base data to estimate the denoising threshold, an efficient denoising algorithm was proposed and used for the dynamic signals in CFBs. Analysis shows that for the local solids concentration time series, high-frequency fluctuations may be one of the system properties, while noise interference can also make a low-frequency contribution. An exact denoising method is needed in such cases. The correlation dimension and Kolmogorov entropy were calculated using denoised data and the results showed that the particle behavior in the CFB is highly complex. Generally, two correlation dimensions coexist in a low-flux CFB. The first correlation dimension is low and corresponds to small-scale fluctuations that reveal a high-frequency pseudo-periodic movement, but the second correlation dimension is high and corresponds to large-scale fluctuations that indicate multi-frequency movements, including particle aggregation and breakage. At the same axial level, the first correlation dimensions change slightly with radial position, and the main tendency is high at the center but slightly lower near the wall. However, the second correlation dimensions show large changes along the radial direction, are again high in the core region, and after r/R ≥ 0.6 (r as radial position, R as radius of the riser), the dimensions clearly drop down. This indicates that the particle behavior is more complex and has higher degrees of freedom at the center, but clusters near the wall are restrained to some degree because of wall effects.",2020-04-01,Particuology,https://openalex.org/V62602987,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.partic.2019.01.005,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955522774,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.partic.2019.01.005,journal-article,2955522774

Alterations in the melanocyte lineage give rise to a plethora of human diseases, from neurocristopathies and pigmentation disorders to melanoma. During embryogenesis, neural crest cell subsets give rise to two waves of melanoblasts, which migrate dorsolaterally, hone to the skin, and differentiate into melanocytes. However, the mechanisms that govern colonization of the skin by the first wave of melanoblasts are poorly understood. Here we report that targeted inactivation of the integrin-linked kinase gene in first wave melanoblasts causes defects in the ability of these cells to form long pseudopods, to migrate, and to proliferate in vivo. As a result, integrin-linked kinase-deficient melanoblasts fail to populate normally the developing epidermis and hair follicles. We also show that defects in motility and dendricity occur upon integrin-linked kinase gene inactivation in mature melanocytes, causing abnormalities in cell responses to the extracellular matrix substrates collagen I and laminin 332. Significantly, the ability to form long protrusions in mutant cells in response to collagen is restored in the presence of constitutively active Rac1, suggesting that an integrin-linked kinase-Rac1 nexus is likely implicated in melanocytic cell establishment, dendricity, and functions in the skin.",2020-02-01,Journal of Investigative Dermatology,https://openalex.org/V28607811,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2019.07.681,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2962994822,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2019.07.681,journal-article,2962994822

The goals of our study are to develop a statistical framework for modelling clustered recurrent and terminal events and to perform dynamic predictions of the terminal event in family studies. We propose a joint nested frailty model for colonoscopy screening visits and colorectal cancer onset in Lynch Syndrome families. The screening and disease processes could each depend on individuals' screening history and other measured covariates and be correlated within families; our approach allows for familial correlations to affect both the visit process and the terminal event and the dependence between the two processes is specified through frailty distributions. We provide dynamic predictions of colorectal cancer risk for an individual conditional on his/her own screening history, his/her family history of screening and disease and other important clinical covariates. We apply our model to 18 Lynch Syndrome families from Newfoundland for individualized dynamic predictions of colorectal cancer risks. We demonstrate that the screening visits are non-ignorable for estimating the disease risks, and the joint nested frailty model improves dynamic prediction accuracies compared to existing joint frailty models after accounting for familial and individual screening and cancer histories.",2020-05-01,Statistical Methods in Medical Research,https://openalex.org/V150263959,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280219863076,,,,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2964567104,https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280219863076,journal-article,2964567104

To investigate the psychometric properties of the five-item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-5) and the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-Screen (GSIS-Screen, submitted) among community-residing middle-aged and older men.Methods. The SBQ-5 and GSIS-Screen were administered to 9 men, 5 years or older, who participated in an eligibility assessment (Time 1) for an upstream psychological intervention study to prevent the onset of suicide ideation among men struggling to transition to retirement. Eligible participants later completed the full GSIS and measures of depression and hopelessness at a pre-group assessment (Time 2).Results. The SBQ-5 was positively associated with the GSIS-Screen at the eligibility assessment. Internal consistency for both measures was low but acceptable. Time  scores on both screens predicted suicide ideation at Time 2, controlling for the intervening time lag and for baseline cognitive and physical functioning. Only the GSIS-Screen uniquely predicted future depression and hopelessness ratings.Conclusions. The SBQ-5 and the GSIS-Screen have acceptable psychometric properties among middle-aged and older community-residing men; the GSIS-Screen is more closely associated with later-life suicide risk factors.Clinical Implications.

2020,4,3,1,0.0,https://openalex.org/W2980836966,Effect of spatially correlated initial geometric imperfection on reliability of spherical latticed shell considering global instability,"Abstract Latticed shells are extensively used for large-span structures because of their good structural behaviour, lightweight and ease of construction. Their codified design is often governed by the global instability requirement for gravity load and specified shape and amplitude of maximum initial geometric imperfection (IGI). The reliability basis for the assigned shape and maximum IGI is unknown. In the present study, it is proposed that IGI is modelled using the simultaneous autoregressive model. It is shown that this model is flexible in modelling spatially varying correlated imperfection and can cope with irregular grid system. By using this model, the effect of the spatially correlated IGI on the probability distribution of the load capacity for global instability and the reliability of spherical latticed shell designed according to the Chinese design code is assessed. It is shown that the use of the prefixed shape of the IGI to assess the probability distribution of the load capacity is unconservative as compared to that by using spatially varying random imperfection. The shape of the probability distribution for the former differs from that for the latter. The reliability analysis results indicate that the use of a critical load factor of 2 implemented in the code leads to a failure probability less than about 10− for global instability if the specified maximum IGI defined in the code equals about two to three times the standard deviation of IGI. This failure probability becomes less than about 10− if a critical load factor of 1.5 is used for design. It is suggested that the code recommended critical load factor may be reduced to 1.5 while achieving target reliability index often adopted for design code calibration.",2020-01-01,Structural Safety,https://openalex.org/V1507157,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2019.101895,101895,101895,82,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980836966,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2019.101895,journal-article,2980836966

Namely, the company chooses to pay dividends at a constant rate only when the surplus is above some nonnegative threshold. Classically, such a company is referred to be ruined immediately when the surplus level becomes negative. Recently, researchers investigate the Parisian ruin problem where the company is allowed to operate under negative surplus for a predetermined period known as the Parisian delay. With the help of the fluctuation identities of spectrally negative Levy processes, we obtain an explicit expression of the expected discounted dividends until Parisian ruin in terms of the relevant scale functions and certain probabilities that need to be evaluated for each specific Levy process. The optimal threshold level under such a threshold dividend strategy is deduced. Applications and numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and examine how the expected discounted aggregate dividends and the optimal threshold level change in response to different Parisian delays.",2020-01-01,Insurance Mathematics & Economics,https://openalex.org/V198325475,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2019.11.002,135,150,90,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991240132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2019.11.002,journal-article,2991240132

Improvements in treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including advanced HF, have allowed an unprecedented number of patients to survive into old age. Despite these advances, patients with HF deteriorate and often require advanced therapies. As the proportion of elderly patients in the population increases, there will be an increasing number of patients to be evaluated for advanced therapies and an increasing number that do not qualify for, won't be considered for, or decline orthotopic heart transplantation. The purpose of this article is to review the benefits of palliative care (PC), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR), device therapy (cardiac resynchronization therapy and mitral clip), and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in advanced HF patients who are transplant ineligible. PC interventions should be introduced early in the course of a patient's diagnosis to manage symptoms, address goals of care, and improve patient-centered outcomes. Further improvement in health-related quality of life as well as functional capacity can be achieved safely in patients with advanced HF through patient participation in ExCR. Device therapy and MCS can reduce HF hospitalizations and improve survival. In fact, early survival with MCS approaches that of heart transplantation.

We evaluated, in older hypertensive and normotensive men and women (n=12 each group), blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index (acetylene rebreathing), total peripheral resistance, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography) at baseline (supine;  minutes) and during graded head-up tilt (30° for  minutes and 60° for 2 minutes). Sympathetic action potential discharge patterns were studied using wavelet-based methodology. In the upright posture, systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses were greater in hypertensive women versus hypertensive men and normotensive women ( P &lt;0.05). No differences existed in the heart rate, stroke index, or cardiac index response between groups; however, the total peripheral resistance response throughout graded head-up tilt was markedly greater in hypertensive women ( P &lt;0.01). Yet, the increase in integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity burst frequency and burst incidence were similar between hypertensive women and men in the supine and upright postures. However, the increase in the mean action potential content per integrated burst and recruitment of previously dormant, larger-sized action potentials during 60° head-up tilt was greater in hypertensive women versus hypertensive men and normotensive women ( P &lt;0.001). Therefore, total sympathetic action potential firing frequency was markedly greater in hypertensive women throughout 60° head-up tilt ( P &lt;0.001).

Cardiac donation after circulatory determination of death (cardiac DCDD) can be performed using direct procurement and perfusion (DPP), where cardiac activity is restored after heart recovery, or (NRP), where brain blood supply is surgically interrupted, circulation to the thoraco-abdominal organs is restored within the donor’s body, followed by heart recovery. While cardiac DCDD would increase the number of heart donors, uptake of programs has been slowed in part because of ethical concerns within the medical community. These debates have been largely devoid of discussion regarding public perceptions. We conducted a national survey of public perceptions regarding cardiac DCDD.

These values-in-action are beliefs shared by both management and workers that align what should happen in performing organizational routines to be safe and be productive with what actually is done. However, the operations and safety management literature provides little guidance on which values-in-action are most important to safe production and how they work together to create a supportive culture.The researchers conducted exploratory case studies in 1 manufacturing plants of  firms. The researchers compared plant managers' top-down perspectives on safety in the performance of work and workers' bottom-up experiences of the safety climate and their rates of injury on the job. Each case study used data collected from interviewing multiple managers, the administration of a climate survey to workers and the examination of the plant's injury rates over time as reported to its third party health and safety insurer.The researchers found that plants with four values-in-action -a commitment to safety, discipline, prevention and participation-were capable of safe production, while plants without those values were neither safe nor productive. Where culture and climate aligned lower rates of injury were experienced.The four value-in-actions must all be present and work together in a self-reinforcing manner to engage workers and managers in achieving safe production.

The gold mineralization is hosted predominantly by Pontiac Group metasedimentary rocks, Piche Group metavolcanic rocks, and quartz monzodiorite to granodiorite porphyritic intrusions. The ore takes the form of a low-grade envelope of disseminated pyrite (0.35 to 1 g/t Au) grading inwards into higher grade (>1 g/t Au) stockwork and breccia zones. Hydrothermal alteration in the metasedimentary rocks is zonally distributed around the fluid pathways. Proximal alteration is characterized by a microcline±albite-quartz replacement-type assemblage, with lesser phlogopite, calcite±Fe-dolomite, pyrite and rutile. The distal alteration assemblage comprises biotite, microcline±albite, phengite, quartz, calcite, pyrite and rutile. In this study, we assess the magnitude and distribution of fluid-rock interaction in the metasedimentary rocks of the Malartic district. The metaturbidites are separated into four lithotypes based on grain-size to reduce the effects of primary depositional processes on mass change calculations. Despite the variability in protolith composition, the metasedimentary rocks define a geochemically consistent, cogenetic sequence. The results of the mass transfer calculations indicate progressive gains in CO2, S, K2O and LOI, as well as Au, Te, W, Ag, As, Be, Sb, Bi, Mo and Pb, from background, to distal and proximal alteration zones (relative to the least-altered samples). Molar element ratio analysis (alkali/aluminum) indicates an increase in alkali metasomatism (K and Na) adjacent to the main hydrothermal fluid pathways, which is manifested by the progressive stabilization of microcline and albite at the expense of oligoclase, biotite and white mica. Ore-associated pathfinder elements delineate broad enrichment patterns around the deposit, and are used to understand hydrothermal fluid circulation in the Malartic district. A statistical approach based on a comparison of the mass change results with the background composition provides robust constraints on the magnitude and extent of the lithogeochemical haloes. Generally, the alteration forms envelopes that extend along the S2 fabric, with the largest lithogeochemical anomalies (e.g., Au, W, Te and Ag) reaching up to 10 km in length, and 2 km in width.

Results exhibit that the optimal conditions for the PNFBR was 30 °C with the 7:1 of ratio of alkalinity to influent nitrogen, 1 mg/L of DO concentration, 28 day of SRT, 16.6 day of hydraulic retention time (HRT), and 400 mg/L of influent ammonia concentration. Additionally, at the lower temperature (20 °C), high nitrite accumulation was also attained by increasing the alkalinity (8:1 of ratio of alkalinity to influent nitrogen) in system. Compared with other biofilm system, the PNFBR with the new media mixture of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and its modified one could achieve the effluent requirements for anammox, with the PNFBR effluent NO2--N:NH4+-N ratio appropriately at 1:1.",2020-02-01,Water Air and Soil Pollution,https://openalex.org/V156652029,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-4408-2,,,231,2,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003306513,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-4408-2,journal-article,3003306513

Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are the progenitor cells for all trophoblast lineages; control of TS cell differentiation into distinct trophoblast subtypes is not well understood. Mice lacking the transcription factor OVO-like 2 (OVOL2) fail to produce a functioning placenta, and die around embryonic day 10.5, suggesting that OVOL2 may be critical for trophoblast development. Therefore, our objective was to determine the role of OVOL2 in mouse TS cell fate. We found that OVOL2 was highly expressed in mouse placenta and differentiating TS cells. Placentas and TS cells lacking OVOL2 showed poor trophoblast differentiation potential, including increased expression of stem-state associated genes (Eomes, Esrrb, Id2) and decreased levels of differentiation-associated transcripts (Gcm1, Tpbpa, Prl3b1, Syna). Ectopic OVOL2 expression in TS cells elicited precocious differentiation. OVOL2 bound proximate to the gene encoding inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2), a dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein, and directly repressed its activity. Overexpression of ID2 was sufficient to reinforce the TS cell stem state. Our findings reveal a critical role of OVOL2 as a regulator of TS cell differentiation and placental development, in-part by coordinating repression of ID2.",2020-03-31,Cells,https://openalex.org/V2736626452,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040840,840,840,9,4,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009496841,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040840,journal-article,3009496841

Gas accretion phase of initially subcritical star-forming clouds,"The accretion phase of star formation is investigated in magnetically-dominated clouds that have an initial subcritical mass-to-flux ratio. We employ nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations that include ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation. During the early prestellar phase the mass-to-flux ratio rises toward the critical value for collapse, and during this time the angular momentum of the cloud core is reduced significantly by magnetic braking. Once a protostar is formed in the core, the accretion phase is characterized by the presence of a small amount of angular momentum but a large amount of magnetic flux in the near-protostellar environment. The low angular momentum leads to a very small (or even nonexistent) disk and weak outflow, while the large magnetic flux can lead to an interchange instability that rapidly removes flux from the central region. The effective magnetic braking in the early collapse phase can even lead to a counter-rotating disk and outflow, in which the rotation direction of the disk and outflow is opposite to that of the infalling envelope. The solutions with a counter-rotating disk, tiny disk, or nonexistent disk (direct collapse) are unique outcomes that are realized in collapse from magnetically-dominated clouds with an initial subcritical mass-to-flux ratio.",2020-05-01,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa672,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010499798,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa672,journal-article,3010499798

In spite of its critical role in fitness and reproduction, surprisingly little is known about the genetic or neural basis of variation in female mate choice. Here, we identify fruitless as a gene affecting female receptivity within Drosophila melanogaster , as well as female Drosophila simulans rejection of male D. melanogaster . Of the multiple transcripts this gene produces, by far the most widely studied is the sex-specifically spliced transcript involved in the sex determination pathway. However, we find that female rejection behaviour is affected by a non-sex-specifically spliced fruitless transcript. This is the first implication of fruitless in female behaviour, and the first behavioural role identified for a fruitless non-sex-specifically spliced transcript. We found that this locus does not influence preferences via a single sensory modality, examining courtship song, antennal pheromone perception, or perception of substrate vibrations, and we conclude that fruitless influences mate choice via the integration of multiple signals or through another sensory modality.",2020-03-25,Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,https://openalex.org/V3006207977,The Royal Society,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.2765,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014082355,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.2765,journal-article,3014082355

Children diagnosed with FASD are not likely to remain with their biological parents, facing early maternal separation and foster placements throughout childhood. Methods We model FASD in mice via prenatal alcohol exposure and further induce early life stress through maternal separation. We use RNA-seq followed by clustering of expression profiles through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze transcriptomic changes that result from the treatments. We use reverse transcription qPCR to validate these changes in the mouse hippocampus. Results We report an association between adult hippocampal gene expression and prenatal ethanol exposure followed by postnatal separation stress that is related to behavioral changes. Expression profile clustering using WGCNA identifies a set of transcripts, module 19, associated with anxiety-like behavior ( r = 0.79, p = 0.002) as well as treatment group ( r = 0.68, p = 0.015). Genes in this module are overrepresented by genes involved in transcriptional regulation and other pathways related to neurodevelopment. Interestingly, one member of this module, Polr2a , polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A, is downregulated by the combination of prenatal ethanol and postnatal stress in an RNA-Seq experiment and qPCR validation ( q = 2e−12, p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions Together, transcriptional control in the hippocampus is implicated as a potential underlying mechanism leading to anxiety-like behavior via environmental insults. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism involved and use this insight towards early diagnosis and amelioration strategies involving children born with FASD.",2020-05-16,Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders,https://openalex.org/V206192428,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-020-09316-3,,,12,1,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3025131372,https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-020-09316-3,journal-article,3025131372

The time series of 12 physico-chemical parameters were examined by using Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression and spectral analysis based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Computed pairwise correlation coefficients matrix revealed that pH values, NO3-, SO42-, Cl- and TDS correlate with Al concentrations at a statistically significant level (α-level = 0.05). The multiple regression model including Cl-, NO3- and pH explains up to 54% of Al concentrations temporal variation in groundwater.

Given their burden, we need to find efficacious ways to prevent these experiences. However, existing prevention programs tend to be single-issue and may not focus on the universal capacities required to reduce these problems among youth. To this end, we evaluated the universal, small groups Healthy Relationships Plus (HRP) program, which focuses on the promotion of positive mental health and the reduction of bullying and substance misuse. A sample of 212 youth from Southwestern Ontario were randomly assigned to the HRP or an attention-control condition over an 8-day period during summer 2014. Primary outcome measures (i.e., most important outcomes for this evaluation) were positive mental health, bullying victimization/perpetration, and substance misuse (alcohol, marijuana). We also examined a mediator (help-seeking) and two moderators (sex, adverse childhood experiences) of main effects. Participation in HRP was associated with reduced odds of physical bullying victimization at 1-year follow-up, compared with adolescents in the attention-control condition. This finding was mediated by increased intention to seek help from a mental health professional following HRP participation. We did not find main effects for positive mental health or substance misuse in this sample; however, there was an interaction effect whereby youth with significant trauma experiences reported less marijuana use at 1-year follow-up compared with control students.

However, there is no consensus within the care literature for how and when such partiality is morally justified. This article outlines and defends a novel justificatory argument that grounds partiality in the facts and values of the relation itself. Specifically, this article argues that partiality is justified when grounded in caring values exemplified in good caring relations. Hence, this justification is termed the argument from good caring relations. This justification is promising for two reasons. First, the argument from good caring relations has the potential to spur engagement between care ethics and the broader partiality literature. In particular, the argument from good caring relations could enhance what Simon Keller has termed ‘the relationships view’. Second, the argument from good caring relations is more persuasive than the other major justificatory argument for partiality presently in the care literature: a distributive argument, which takes the form of a modified version of Robert Goodin’s assigned responsibility model of moral obligation. Indeed, where this distributive argument fails, the argument from good caring relation succeeds.

Hence, many debates would benefit from a technical definition of this term that would allow scholars to clearly distinguish what counts as a slur and what not. Although the paper offers different definitions of the term in order to allow the reader to choose her favorite, I claim that ‘slurs’ is the name given to a grammatical category, and I consequently trace a difference in kind between slurs and other kinds of group pejoratives. I rely on a novel approach to slurs that characterizes them based on their membership to a particular kind of register category, an often neglected sociolinguistic notion determining the social contexts in which registered terms are expected, tolerated or unacceptable. The paper also points out to the close link between words registered as [+derogatory] (slurs) and their usage in the context of dominance relations of different kinds between users and recipients of slurs. By pointing out to this link I hope to underscore the political significance of slur usage, as well as to contribute further to the explanation why slurs are so damaging and unacceptable in most social contexts.",2020-05-01,Philosophical Studies,https://openalex.org/V147022693,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-019-01259-3,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2917684906,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-019-01259-3,journal-article,2917684906

Solubility and crystallization mechanisms for columbite-(Mn) and tantalite-(Mn) have been extensively studied in haplogranitic melts, with little research into other ore minerals. In this study the solubilities of wodginite, titanowodginite, microlite and pyrochlore are compared to those for columbite-(Mn) and tantalite-(Mn) in a flux-rich haplogranitic melt of alumina saturation index (ASI) 1.0 (ASILi of 0.83) at 700–850 °C and 200 MPa. The effect of melt composition on the solubilities of wodginite, titanowodginite, and microlite compared to tantalite-(Mn) is also investigated in highly fluxed haplogranitic melts of ASI 1.0, 1.10, and 1.2 (ASILi of 0.83, 0.90, 1.02), at 700 °C and 800 °C and 200 MPa. The log solubility product (logKsp) at 750 °C and melt ASI of 1.0 is highest for tantalite-(Mn) (−2.32 mol2/kg2) followed by columbite-(Mn) (−2.68 mol2/kg2), and pyrochlore (−3.71 mol3/kg3) titanowodginite (−3.73 mol3/kg3), wodginite (−3.77 mol3/kg3), and microlite (−3.78 mol3/kg3), the latter four of which are almost identical within error. However, solubility can also be expressed as a mineral-melt partition coefficient, with higher partition coefficients reflecting lower solubilities. The tantalum mineral-melt partition coefficients of wodginite (27.0), titanowodginite (30.2), and tantalite-(Mn) (29.6) are identical within error; microlite is higher (80.3, reflected by lower concentrations of tantalum in the melt for stoichiometric saturation) because it contains a major melt cation, sodium. The niobium mineral-melt partition coefficient for columbite-(Mn) (66.1) is higher than for pyrochlore (50.1). Wodginite, titanowodginite, pyrochlore, columbite-(Mn) and tantalite-(Mn) have similar temperature and melt composition dependences, but conversely, microlite solubility increases with ASI. As all studied minerals have been shown to have similar relative solubilities at stoichiometric saturation, it can be concluded that, in general, the presence of bivalent (Ca, Mn, Fe) and some tetravalent cations (Sn, Ti) control which tantalum and niobium phases crystallize in rare metal deposits.",2020-01-01,Lithos,https://openalex.org/V107629180,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105239,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981209319,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105239,journal-article,2981209319

A follow-up assessment of nursing home residents in the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale (GSIS) development study; 2. A trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) with suicidal older adults; 3. A longitudinal study of risk and resiliency to late-life suicide ideation. We specifically assessed the distributions of RFL-OA items and their associations with suicide ideation and behavior to create an RFL-Suicide Resiliency subscale (RFL-SR); we then tested the psychometric properties of this measure's items drawn from the larger RFL-OA.Results: Nine RFL-OA items were significantly associated with suicide ideation and history of suicide behavior and were not highly correlated with social desirability. Psychometric analyses supported the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of this scale.Conclusions: The items of the RFL-SR demonstrated strong psychometric properties with older adults in clinical and community settings.Clinical Implications: The RFL-SR may make a useful addition to suicide risk assessment in gerontological research and clinical practice.",2020-01-01,Clinical Gerontologist,https://openalex.org/V5675302,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2019.1675840,61,75,43,1,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982033817,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2019.1675840,journal-article,2982033817

These sequences can confer fitness benefits to the bacterial host, but may also instigate cell death through induction. Several recent investigations have revealed that the distribution of prophage lengths is bimodal, with a clear distinction between small and large prophages. Here we develop a mathematical model of the evolutionary forces affecting the prophage size distribution, and fit this model to three recent data sets. This approach offers quantitative estimates for the relative rates of lysogeny, induction, mutational degradation and selection acting on a wide class of prophage sequences. The model predicts that large prophages are predominantly maintained by the introduction of new prophage sequences through lysogeny, whereas shorter prophages can be enriched when they no longer encode the genes necessary for induction, but still offer selective benefits to their hosts.",2020-06-01,Theoretical Population Biology,https://openalex.org/V17807283,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2019.11.003,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990021576,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2019.11.003,journal-article,2990021576

To give realistic ranges of aftershock simulations in regions with limited data and to provide time-dependent seismic hazard information right after a future giant shock, we assess the variability of the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model parameters in subduction zones that have experienced M≥7.5 earthquakes, comparing estimates from long time windows with those from individual sequences. Our results show that the ETAS parameters are more robust if estimated from a long catalog than from individual sequences, given individual sequences have fewer data including missing early aftershocks. Considering known biases of the parameters (due to model formulation, the isotropic spatial aftershock distribution, and finite size effects of catalogs), we conclude that the variability of the ETAS parameters that we observe from robust estimates is not significant, neither across different subduction-zone regions nor as a function of maximum observed magnitudes. We also find that ETAS parameters do not change when multiple M 8.0–9.0 events are included in a region, mainly because an M 9.0 sequence dominates the number of events in the catalog. Based on the ETAS parameter estimates in the long time period window, we propose a set of ETAS parameters for future M 9.0 sequences for aftershock hazard assessment (K0=0.04±0.02, α=2.3, c=0.03±0.01, p=1.21±0.08, γ=1.61±0.29, d=23.48±18.17, and q=1.68±0.55). Synthetic catalogs created with the suggested ETAS parameters show good agreement with three observed M 9.0 sequences since 196 (the 200 M 9.

Numerous systems, from sandpiles to gene regulatory networks to swarms to human brains, seem to work towards preserving a precarious balance right at their critical point. Understanding criticality therefore seems strongly related to a broad, fundamental theory for the physics of life as it could be, which still lacks a clear description of how life can arise and maintain itself in complex systems. In order to investigate this crucial question, we model populations of Ising agents competing for resources in a simple 2D environment subject to an evolutionary algorithm. We then compare its evolutionary dynamics under different experimental conditions. We demonstrate the utility that arises at a critical state and contrast it with the behaviors and dynamics that arise far from criticality. The results show compelling evidence that not only is a critical state remarkable in its ability to adapt and find solutions to the environment, but the evolving parameters in the agents tend to flow towards criticality if starting from a supercritical regime. We present simulations showing that a system in a supercritical state will tend to self-organize towards criticality, in contrast to a subcritical state, which remains subcritical though it is still capable of adapting and increasing its fitness.",2020-04-28,Artificial Life,https://openalex.org/V2181302,MIT Press,https://doi.org/10.1162/artl_a_00309,112,129,26,1,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004857959,https://doi.org/10.1162/artl_a_00309,journal-article,3004857959

However, formal content validation of the full or Short-WORC has not been reported. This study aims to understand how 1) people interpret and calibrate responses to items on the Short-WORC and 2) compensatory strategies that might enhance function and thereby affect responses. Methods This study uses cognitive interviewing, a qualitative methodology that focuses on the interpretation of questionnaire items. Patients with rotator cuff disorders ( n = 10), clinicians ( n = 6) and measurement researchers (n = 10) were interviewed using a talk aloud structured interview that evaluated each of the  items of the Short-WORC. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim by one researcher (R.F). Analysis was done through an open coding scheme using a previously established framework. Results Overall, the items on the Short-WORC were well received by participants.

In maternal health, their role includes the provision of preventive and promotional health services at the community level. They provide services such as health education on maternal health wellbeing, advice and information on access and timely utilization of health facilities for prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. The contribution of M-CHWs in the health sector combined with other government initiatives led the country to achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) - target 5A- that aimed to improve maternal health through the reduction of maternal mortality ratio by 75% between 1990 and 2015). The objective of this study was to explore M-CHWs’ perceptions and experiences on access and provision of maternal health services. Methods We used a case study methodology, a qualitative research approach to explore M-CHWs’ experiences and perceptions on access and provision of maternal health services at the community level in Rwanda . For the period of June–August 2014, in-depth interviews were conducted with sixteen M-CHWs who had been providing maternal health services in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. Participants shared their experiences and perceptions on access and provision of maternal health service in their communities. Results The results of this research highlight the role of M-CHWs in promoting the use of health facilities for prenatal care and delivery and the ways they use to reach out to women. Several challenges prohibit M-CHWs to deliver adequate maternal health services and these are related to the poor resources settings in which they operate. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the experiences and perceptions of M-CHWs on the provision and access to maternal health services in their communities. The fact that M-CHWs are volunteers operating in limited resources settings with no formal training in maternal health and with considerable workloads translates into challenges regarding the quality and quantity of services they provide in their communities.

We reared animals from egg on a banana-based laboratory diet and diets made of apple ( Malus domestica Borkhausen; Rosaceae), blueberry ( Vaccinium Linnaeus; Ericaceae), cherry ( Prunus avium Linnaeus; Rosaceae), grape ( Vitis Linnaeus; Vitaceae), orange ( Citrus × sinensis (Linnaeus) Osbeck; Rutaceae), raspberry ( Rubus Linnaeus; Rosaceae), or strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne; Rosaceae) homogenate in agar and measured development time, adult body size, and cold tolerance. Diet type had complex effects on development time; in particular, D. suzukii reared on apple-based or blueberry-based diets developed more slowly to a smaller adult body size than those on other diets. Cold exposure killed eggs and both first and second instars. Survival of 24 hours at +4 °C by feeding third instars was lowest in blueberry and cherry. Five days at +0.6 °C killed all feeding third instars; this treatment is likely sufficient for targeting D. suzukii in fruit. Two hours at − °C or − °C killed all wandering third instars and pupae; this exposure could be sufficient for sanitation of packaging.",2020-08-01,Canadian Entomologist,https://openalex.org/V197406704,Cambridge University Press (Entomological Society of Canada),https://doi.org/10.4039/tce.2020.36,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3036648428,https://doi.org/10.4039/tce.2020.36,journal-article,3036648428

However, in former agricultural systems, soil heterogeneity can be low as a legacy of tillage (that is, via the process of soil homogenization). We investigated the relationship between soil homogenization and three ecosystem functional response variables—aboveground productivity, nitrogen retention (assessed via 15N tracer addition) and plant litter decomposition (assessed using litter bags)—during the first 2 years following a tallgrass prairie restoration in a former agricultural field. We compared plots with substrate heterogeneity (topsoil patches enriched with sand or woodchips) with homogeneous plots that contained the same overall ratios of the component materials. We also compared plots with topographic heterogeneity (pits and mounds) with flat plots. The ecosystem response variables varied significantly with soil homogenization, but the effect depended on the type of heterogeneity (sand vs. woodchips vs. microtopography), which was consistent with these sources of heterogeneity having variable effects on soil water and nutrient availability. Soil homogenization reduced aboveground productivity by 50% for the woodchip treatment, but it had the opposite effect for the topography treatment. Homogenization also reduced plant 15N retention for the woodchip treatment by 50%, but the rate of litter decomposition increased by 8%. Overall, variation in nitrogen retention and decomposition were associated with the treatment effects on aboveground productivity and the relative abundances of forbs and grasses. The latter results suggest that the influence of soil homogenization on ecosystem function may occur indirectly as a result of its effects on plant community assembly. Moreover, forb productivity and N retention along woodchip and mound edges differed from the means of the adjacent patches, which revealed that complementarity along microsite edges can contribute to soil heterogeneity effects on ecosystem function.",2020-03-01,Ecosystems,https://openalex.org/V83499872,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00401-w,264,277,23,2,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2946012305,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00401-w,journal-article,2946012305

Most of the data are from Oklahoma, with some records from Alberta. Our focus is on the subset of available records that are of most interest for engineering analyses aimed at evaluation of the potential hazards from induced events, which is a pressing issue in western Canada and other regions experiencing induced seismicity. We considered all records to 5 km for events of M ≥ 4.5. For events of M 4 to 4.5, we select records at close distance (&lt;10 km), having good signal strength (PGA &gt; ∼3%g), to allow high-quality time histories to be obtained. These records have strong signal-to-noise ratio, making them suitable for engineering applications, such as dynamic analysis, after proper scaling. The selected records are windowed, filtered, and instrument-corrected to compile a set of records having acceptable acceleration, velocity, and displacement time histories. The records and their response spectra are provided as an electronic supplement at http://www.seismotoolbox.ca/IS_Strong_Motions/ . We note that the record set is not suitable as a response spectra database for development of ground-motion prediction equations, because for M &lt 4.5 the record selection is biased to records with higher amplitudes.

However, work specifically exploring how to support the high-quality implementation of such programming with Canadian teachers and schools is just beginning to emerge. Drawing on implementation frameworks that emphasize the importance of setting, provider, and implementation process characteristics for understanding program implementation outcomes, this prospective, longitudinal study explores implementation of the Fourth R, a SEL-based healthy relationships program, in a Western Canadian province using a sample of middle school teachers. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to illuminate relationships among teachers’ attitudes toward evidence-based programming, perceptions of organizational climate, and training experience with program implementation outcomes (dosage, quality, fidelity). Findings of this exploratory study identified that these characteristics influenced implementation dosage, quality, and fidelity in differential ways. Qualitative data drawn from teacher interviews supported quantitative findings and highlighted the importance of organizational support for high-quality implementation.

The use of ultra-high fields to enhance sensitivity inevitably results in an increase in TR because of specific absorption rate (SAR) constraints, causing inadequate sampling of hemodynamic response in functional MRI, and adversely affecting concurrent measurement such as blood oxygen level dependent. To address this problem, variable-rate selective excitation (VERSE) radiofrequency (RF) pulses were used. Methods The conventional (sinc) selective RF pulses of the Q2TIPS block in the PICORE pulsed ASL (PASL) sequence used for blood saturation were replaced by their equivalent VERSE RF waveforms. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned using the conventional and VERSE PASL sequences on a head-only 7T scanner operating in parallel transmit mode. Results VERSE PASL sequence provides perfusion images similar to the conventional version, with comparable perfusion SNR (conventional, 3.3 ± 0.48; VERSE, 3.2 ± 0.55) and temporal SNR (conventional, 1.0 ± 0.20; VERSE, 1.0 ± 0.12) for TR = 3.5 seconds and 70 measurements. With shorter acquisition time (TR = 2.5 seconds), VERSE PASL sequence still provides similar results to those acquired using the conventional PASL sequence with longer TR = 3.5 seconds.

Microsite edges (microedges) may also offer additional niche space. Therefore, in recently abandoned croplands, which often have uniform soils caused by a legacy of tillage (soil homogenization), the plant species diversity of future restoration efforts may be reduced. We conducted an experiment during the early establishment phase (3 years) of a tallgrass prairie restoration on former cropland to determine if soil homogenization decreases species diversity and alters community composition, and if microedges offer additional niche space. Heterogeneous plots with sand‐ or woodchip‐enriched patches were compared to plots made up of the same components, but distributed homogeneously, and pits and mounds were compared to flat topsoil. Homogenization decreased diversity in flat topsoil plots relative to pit plots and increased diversity in woodchip plots. In both cases, the treatments with the lowest canopy cover and greatest plant density had the greatest diversity. Sand and topographic homogenization decreased diversity, but when a drought occurred in year two, the effect was suppressed in the sand treatment and magnified in the pit plots. Microedges had properties unique from adjacent patches. Overall, variability in heterogeneity–diversity relationships was affected by interactions with plant growth patterns and environmental conditions. Our results indicate that while the addition of contrasting soil microsites has the potential to promote increased diversity in grassland restoration on former cropland, the patch components and design must be optimized to achieve this management goal.",2020-01-01,Restoration Ecology,https://openalex.org/V191257319,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.13049,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978954029,https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.13049,journal-article,2978954029

Correctly defining individuals as treatment dropouts may help efforts to reduce dropout. The development of a novel definition of dropout is described, which suggested the optimal number of sessions required should vary based on a client’s need at intake. Dropout was defined as receiving lower than the optimal number of sessions. The novel definition was compared to existing definitions in a secondary data analysis of individual’s first and second episodes of care. The sample contained children (N = 650; 61% male) aged 5–13 who attended one of five studied mental health agencies in Ontario, CA. Discriminant function analysis was used to predict individuals who met: (a) all current dropout definitions and the need-based definition, (b) any one or two definitions of dropout, or (c) no definitions of dropout. In the first and second episodes of care respectively, the prevalence of dropout was 63.5 and 69.7% using the need-based definition, 93.5 and 76.5% using the dose definition, and 53.3 and 84.4% using the clinician judgment definition. In the first episode of care, higher child internalizing and externalizing problems and greater caregiver needs differentiated dropouts from treatment completers using the need-based definition. Further, families with higher child problem severity and higher caregiver needs were more likely to be categorized as a dropout by all definitions.

Among the various properties of elastomers, electrical breakdown strength strongly affects their application and design due to safety reason. Nevertheless, measuring and determining the electrical breakdown strength of elastomers is a difficult challenge. This work proposes a general predictor and relation for the electrical breakdown strength of various types of elastomers. Based on configurational mechanics, the proposed predictor captures the stretch dependence, the voltage ramping-rate dependence and the elastic modulus dependence of the breakdown strength through the evolution of defects within the material and can effectively keep track of the variation of the electrical breakdown strength.

When complex environments exceed trainees' aptitude, this may reduce feelings of competence, which can hamper motivation. Motivation theories explain how intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects influence motivation. Clinical environments include additional aspects that may not fit into these theories. We used a systems approach to explore how the clinical environment influences trainees' motivation and how they are intertwined. Methods We employed the rich pictures drawing method as a visual tool to capture the complexities of the clinical environment. A total of 15 trainees drew a rich picture representing a motivating situation in the workplace and were interviewed afterwards. Data collection and analysis were performed iteratively, following a constructivist grounded theory approach, using open, focused and selective coding strategies as well as memo writing. Both drawings and the interviews were used to reach our results. Results Trainees drew situations pertaining to tasks they enjoyed doing and that mattered for their learning or patient care. Four dimensions of the environment were identified that supported trainees' motivation. First, social interactions, including interpersonal relationships, supported motivation through close collaboration between health care professionals and trainees. Second, organisational features, including processes and procedures, supported motivation when learning opportunities were provided or trainees were able to influence their work schedule. Third, technical possibilities, including tools and artefacts, supported motivation when tools were used to provide trainees with feedback or trainees used specific instruments in their training. Finally, physical space supported motivation when the actual setting improved the atmosphere or trainees were able to modify the environment to help them focus.

The prevailing theory for this pattern of sterility evokes divergent changes in separate lineages having maladaptive interactions when placed together in a hybrid individual, with recessive factors on the sex chromosome interacting with dominant factors on the autosomes. The effect of these interactions on gametogenesis should not be uniform across species pairs unless genetic divergence follows the same paths in different lineages or if a specific stage of gametogenesis is more susceptible to detrimental genetic interactions. Here, we perform a detailed cellular characterization of hybrid male sterility across three recently diverged species pairs of Drosophila . Across all three pairs, sterile hybrid sperm are alive but exhibit rapid nuclear de-condensation with age, with active, but non-differentiated, mitochondria. Surprisingly, all three sets of interspecies hybrids produce half of the number of sperm per round of spermatogenesis, with each sperm cell containing two tails. We identify non-disjunction failures during meiosis I as the likely cause.

TNBC tumors lack estrogen receptor (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 (ErbB2) and exhibit increased glutamine metabolism, a requirement for tumor growth. The G protein-coupled kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) is highly expressed in patient TNBC tumors and promotes malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells. This study found that TNBC patients displayed elevated plasma kisspeptin levels compared with healthy subjects. It also provides the first evidence that in addition to promoting tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, KISS1R-induced glutamine dependence of tumors. In addition, tracer-based metabolomics analyses revealed that KISS1R promoted glutaminolysis and nucleotide biosynthesis by increasing c-Myc and glutaminase levels, key regulators of glutamine metabolism.

One reason behind this problem is that venues generally permit customers, of varying group size, to freely choose seats, and thus causing a sub-optimal seating allocation with sparsely stranded single seats. Due to the experiential attribute of live entertainment, ticket requests are predominantly groups wishing sets of contiguous seats. Consequently, the sparse single seats remain unsold. To solve this operational problem we analyze a capacity based revenue management control problem that explicitly accounts for group size and customer choice. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process with the objective to maximize total expected profit. Each period, and for a given arriving group size, the manager decides which price-differentiated segments to make available. Given the offered segments, customers select seats from a particular segment or choose not to purchase any. We discuss three selection models and provide algorithms to determine the optimal solution for each. Motivated by ad hoc provisions observed in practice and due to the curse of dimensionality we provide and analyze via simulation a heuristic. Finally, based on transactional sales data from a large annual North American sporting event we showcase how the model parameters can empirically be estimated.",2020-12-16,European Journal of Operational Research,https://openalex.org/V103321696,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.02.017,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008139789,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.02.017,journal-article,3008139789

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of hip arthroscopy on physical activity post-arthroscopy. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases was undertaken in identifying studies from January 1st 199 to December 5th 2019. The search included English language articles reporting physical activity as an outcome following hip arthroscopy in adults aged 18-50 years. Quality assessment, data extraction and synthesis of included studies were undertaken. Results Full text articles ( n = 234) were assessed for eligibility following screening of titles and abstracts ( n = 2086), yielding 12 studies for inclusion. The majority (86%) of the studies were level 4 evidence. One study reported objective activity data. The most frequently occurring patient-reported outcome measure was the Hip Outcome Score-sport-specific subscale (HOS-SS, 84% of studies). Post--arthroscopy improvement was indicated by large effect sizes for patient-reported outcome measures (standard paired difference [95% confidence interval] −1.35[−1.61 to −1.09] at more than 2 years post-arthroscopy); however, the majority of outcome scores for the HOS-SS did not meet the defined level for a patient-acceptable symptom state. Conclusion The current level of available information regarding physical activity for post arthroscopy patients is limited in scope. Outcomes have focused on patients’ perceived difficulties with sport-related activities with a paucity of information on the type, quality and quantity of activity undertaken.

While the hydrogen concentrations range from 300 to 1500 ppm for the whole sample collection, δ2H values range from −74‰ to −54‰ (VSMOW) for the Mesoproterozoic halite sampled from the Sibley Group, Ontario, Canada, and from −89 to −38‰ for the Neoproterozoic halite from the Browne Formation, Officer Basin, Australia. The amount of evaporation required to precipitate halite is accompanied by a deuterium-enrichment of 30‰ to 90‰. It means that the original aqueous solutions had δ2H values comprised between −140‰ and −90‰. Considering the estimated tropical paleolatitudes for both depositional environments, surface waters were most likely significantly deuterium-depleted relative to modern ones. If such interpretation is partly at variance with the geological record, it could be reconciliated with some modelling outputs of the long-term water cycle. Indeed, several mechanisms produce a progressive deuterium-enrichment of the oceans. Those identified so far are the addition of deuterium-rich extraterrestrial water (cometary dust), the loss of  during water photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation in the upper atmosphere, and the isotopic fractionation that takes place during the hydroxylation of nominally-anhydrous mantle rock-forming minerals. We also propose that the major process able to shift through time the δ2Η of the hydrosphere is the reduction of H2O into H during the serpentinization of mantle rocks at mid-ocean ridges.",2020-05-20,Chemical Geology,https://openalex.org/V141585851,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119583,119583,119583,541,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010700451,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119583,journal-article,3010700451

Design Parents of competitive youth ice hockey players (N = 437) read a vignette that either described a parent from the participant’s own team (i.e., ingroup), or a parent from an opposing team (i.e., outgroup) acting antisocially towards an athlete from the participant’s own team, an opposing athlete, or their own child. Parents were asked whether they would respond to the antisocial behaviour in the form of direct or indirect criticism or report the behaviour to the coach or to the league. Results Parents were more likely to directly criticize ingroup parents than outgroup parents and they were more likely to indirectly criticize outgroup parents than ingroup parents. Further, parents with stronger social identities reported higher intentions to indirectly criticize an outgroup parent. There were no main effects for reporting behaviour (to coach or league), and personal identity did not moderate relationships with moral intentions towards antisocial behaviour.

While the Ottawa Statement on the ethical design and conduct of cluster randomized trials provides guidance for researchers and research ethics committees, it does not explicitly focus on low- and middle-income settings. Main body In this paper, we use the lens of the Ottawa Statement to analyze two cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income settings in order to identify gaps or ethical issues requiring further analysis and guidance. The PolyIran trial was a parallel-arm, cluster trial examining the effectiveness of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease in Golestan province, Iran. The PASTAL trial was an adaptive, multistage, parallel-arm, cluster trial evaluating the effect of incentives for human immunodeficiency virus self-testing and follow-up on male partners of pregnant women in Malawi. Through an in-depth case analysis of these two studies we highlight several issues in need of further exploration. First, standards for verbal consent and waivers of consent require methods for operationalization if they are to be employed consistently. Second, the appropriate choice of a control arm remains contentious. Particularly in the case of implementation interventions, locally available care is required as the comparator to address questions of comparative effectiveness. However, locally available care might be lower than standards set out in national guidelines. Third, while the need for access to effective interventions post-trial is widely recognized, it is often not possible to guarantee this upfront. Clarity on what is required of researchers and sponsors is needed. Fourth, there is a pressing need for ethics education and capacity building regarding cluster randomized trials in these settings. Conclusion We identify four issues in cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries for which further ethical analysis and guidance is required.",2020-04-16,Trials,https://openalex.org/V109512841,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04269-3,,,21,S1,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016685653,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-04269-3,journal-article,3016685653

Conversely, data concerning these types of infarctions and the affected adjacent brain circuits are scarce. It remains to be determined if the co-morbid concurrence of large infarct and β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity can precipitate the early development of dementia. Here, we described a dose-dependent effect of a unilateral striatal injection of vasoconstrictive endothelin-1 (ET-1) along with Aβ toxicity on CNS pathogenesis; driven by the anatomical and functional networks within a brain circuit. After 2 days of treatment, a high dose (60 pmol) of ET-1 (E60) alone caused the greatest increase in neuroinflammation, mainly in the ipsilateral striatum and distant regions with synaptic links to the striatal lesion such as white matter (subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, internal capsule, anterior commissure), gray matter (globus pallidus, thalamus), and cortices (cingulate, motor, somatosensory, entorhinal). The combined E6 + Aβ treatment also extended perturbation in the contralateral hemisphere of these rats, such as increased deposition of amyloid precursor protein fragments associated with the appearance of degenerating cells and the leakage of laminin from the basement membrane across a compromised blood-brain barrier. However, the cerebral damage induced by the  pmol ET-1 (E6), Aβ and E + Aβ rats was not detrimental enough to injure the complete network.

There is little or no consensus about the role of neuroglial cells in maintaining CBF in various neuropathologies. This consensus becomes scarcer when it comes to clinical and experimental cases of comorbid Abeta-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and ischemia. Here, a comorbid rat model of Aβ toxicity and endothelin-1 induced ischemia (ET1) not only demonstrated the appearance of axotomized phagocytosed pyknotic neurons (NeuN) immediately after the injury, but also showed a diversity of continuously changing neuroglia (MHC Class II/OX6, Iba1) and macrophage (Iba1/CD68) phenotypes with round, stout somas, and retracted processes. This is indicative of a response to a concomitant increase in large fluid-filled spaces due to the vascular leakage. Ironically 4 weeks after the injury despite a conclusive reduction in neurons, CBF restoration in ET1 rats was associated with a massive increase in neuroglial cell numbers, hypertrophy, ramification, and soma sizes bordering the continuously reducing lesion core and inflamed vasculature, possibly to shield their leaky phenotype. Astrocytes were also found to be releasing matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9), which stabilized matrix ligand β-dystroglycan (β-DG) in repaired or functional vessels. Changing neuroglia phenotypes, responses, motility, astrocytic recruitment of MMP9, and β-DG stabilization implies the role of communication between neuroglia and endothelium in recovering CBF, in the absence of neurons, in ET1 rats compared to Aβ+ET1 rats, which showed characteristics delayed neuroglial activation. Stimulation of timely neuroglial reactivity may serve as a viable strategy to compensate for the neuronal loss in restoring CBF in comorbid cases of ischemia and Aβ toxicity.",2020-04-01,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,https://openalex.org/V33948212,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-019-00735-y,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972446148,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-019-00735-y,journal-article,2972446148

It is treated initially with a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis at the bedside. Due to the high stakes and urgency of this complication, teaching this in the clinical setting is difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a cadaveric model for addressing this problem. METHODS A fresh-frozen human cadaveric model of RH was created using a Foley catheter to simulate elevated intraocular pressure. Residents who participated in an emergencies in otolaryngology-head & neck surgery camp were included in the study. A survey measuring confidence levels in performing lateral canthotomy and cantholysis was administered. After completing the skill station, a postintervention survey was administered to assess the confidence of the learner as well as fidelity and usefulness of the task trainer. RESULTS Thirty-three residents participated in the boot camp. Residents rated their confidence preintervention at 1.3/5, which suggests the majority were unable to perform the procedure. After using the model, residents rated their confidence at 3.5/5, which falls between basic knowledge and reasonably confident; this improvement achieved statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The fidelity of the model was rated 3.9/5; a score of  is defined as realistic. The residents rated the usefulness of the model as 4.7; a score of  is defined as very useful.

Specific vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been associated with adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal and neonatal VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, TaqI, BsmI, FokI, Tru9I) on maternal and neonatal vitamin D status. VDR polymorphisms were genotyped in 70 mother-neonate pairs of Greek origin, and classified according to international thresholds for Vitamin D status. Mean neonatal and maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were 3 ± 2 and 4 ± 2 nmol/l, respectively. Neonatal VDR polymorphisms were not associated with neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations. In contrast, mothers with the Fokl FF polymorphism had a 70 % lower risk of vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D <30 nmol/l] compared with ff ones, after adjustment for several confounders. They were also in 7 % and 8 % lower risk of giving birth to vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D <30 nmol/l] neonates compared with Ff and ff mothers, respectively.

Preceptor, or clinical teacher, recruitment at these sites has been an ongoing challenge. However, residents-as-teachers (RaT) curricula have not been modified to support the development of rural teachers. This study aimed to compare teaching opportunities between rural and urban family medicine residents and to identify mechanisms underlying potential differences. METHODS Year- and Year- family medicine residents at seven Canadian institutions participated in a mixed-methods study utilising a quantitative survey and a qualitative interview. Rural and urban residents rated the quantity and types of teaching opportunities available during their training, from which a chi-squared analysis was completed. Volunteer respondents participated in a structured interview, from which a thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS Rural family medicine residents had fewer opportunities to teach compared to their urban colleagues. This discrepancy was seen across multiple domains, including informal opportunities when on family medicine rotations, χ2 (4, n = 242) = 45.26, P < .000, Bonferroni's adjusted P < .000. Thematic analysis centred around determining factors influencing teaching opportunities and identified that the academic context, personal factors and programme factors were key dimensions. Within these dimensions, the number of medical students, a desire to be an educator and administrative support were cited as influences on teaching opportunities. CONCLUSIONS The lack of teaching opportunities for rural trainees is attributable to a combination of practical and organisational factors revealed through thematic analysis. If rural graduates are not comfortable balancing the demands of service and teaching, this could compound the already prevalent issue of rural preceptor recruitment. It is essential to develop a rural-focused RaT curriculum to close this gap and produce competent educators who are ready to inspire generations of rural physicians.",2020-02-01,Medical Education,https://openalex.org/V54816476,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14015,162,170,54,2,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2996073589,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14015,journal-article,2996073589

A regime switching structure accommodates for periods of unusually high volatility, heterogeneous dynamics and changes in the dependence between the latent states. The model allows separating the continuous component of the variance risk premium from the impact of jumps on option implied variance expectations. Using options and high frequency returns for the S&P500 index, we explain what is generating return predictability by disentangling the part of the variance risk premium associated with normal sized price fluctuations from that associated with tail events.

Worked examples, which show the learner the logic behind the solving of a problem, can decrease extraneous load. However, there is little research to guide the optimal formatting of worked examples.In a crossover design, first-year medical students were randomised to worked examples of bradycardias with salient features first and tachycardias with discriminatory features second (n = 33) or worked examples of bradycardias with discriminatory features first and tachycardias with salient features second (n = 32). After each learning phase, participants completed a testing phase. Diagnostic accuracy and reported cognitive load were compared between the two worked example formats, as well as with data for a group of historical controls, consisting of medical students interpreting electrocardiogram rhythms without worked examples. Each module concluded with a questionnaire in which the learner was asked to rate his or her perceptions of the difficulty of the core content, the clarity with which the information was presented, and perceived learning.Worked examples highlighting salient and discriminatory features were associated with similar levels of diagnostic accuracy (56% and 60%, respectively; P = .32). Both worked example conditions were associated with higher diagnostic accuracy than was found in historical controls (P < .0001). There was no difference in the extraneous load experienced between worked examples highlighting salient features and those highlighting discriminatory features (12.5 ± 6.1 and 11.9 ± 6.1, respectively; P = .52). Participants reported greater intrinsic load in the worked examples highlighting salient rather than discriminatory features (17.1 ± 4.9 and 15.5 ± 4.6, respectively; P = .01).Discriminatory feature-based worked examples were associated with less intrinsic cognitive load, but this did not translate into any meaningful difference in diagnostic performance.

Agricultural land use effects were assessed by conducting a reciprocal transfer experiment between two stream reaches exposed to differing intensities of row crop and livestock agricultural activity representing best attainable and highly developed agricultural land use scenarios. We found that transferred insect communities showed no change in richness, abundance, distribution or biomass, indicating that exposure to increased agricultural intensity did not have selective lethal effects on transferred benthic insect communities. However, populations of Ephemerellidae and Hydropsyche demonstrated an increase and decrease, respectively, in body-mass following the transfer to the best attainable agriculture site. Furthermore, the community biomass size spectrum at the best attainable agriculture site contained large, predatory insects not found at the intensive agriculture site. Our findings suggest that taxon-specific body-mass and biomass size spectra have the potential to detect environmental effects prior to long-term community changes.

Both shallow- and deeply-cracked (i.e. a/W = 0.2 and 0.5) specimens are considered in the analysis. The residual stresses are introduced by different mechanical pre-loading techniques and consistent with those measured from pipeline girth welds and those specified in well-known structural integrity assessment standards.

The standard injury assessment tool is the ""legform,"" a device that mimics the human lower limb under impact loads. These devices are designed to identify the impact load that will cause the onset of injury, rather than replicate the type and severity of fracture. Thus, this study is the first to determine if composite tibias made by Sawbones (Pacific Research Labs, Vashon, WA, USA) designed for orthopedic biomechanics research, could also potentially be used for traffic safety research by simulating both the damage tolerance of human cadaveric tibias for peak force and bending moment and the fracture patterns themselves, thereby more accurately predicting injury type during real-world pedestrian-vehicle collisions.Methods: Synthetic tibias (n = 6) and human cadaveric tibias (n = 6) were impacted at midshaft at 8.3 m/s (i.e., 3 km/h) under 3-point bending using a pneumatic impacting apparatus. Fracture force, bending moment, and fracture patterns were compared between the two groups, and Weibull survivability curves generated for force and moment results, to identify injury risk thresholds.Results: There was no difference for synthetic vs. cadaveric tibias regarding impact force (4271+/-938 N vs. 4889+/-993 N, p = 0.44) or bending moment at fracture (275+/-64 Nm vs. 302+/-107 Nm, p = 0.69). Force-time curves for all tibias were similar in shape based on the first three Principal Components (p > 0.14). Weibull survivability curves had differences in shape and in the 10% risk of fracture limits, with force thresholds of 287 N for the synthetic vs. 338 N for the cadaveric, and bending moment limits of 18 Nm for the synthetic compared to 15 Nm for the cadaveric. All fracture patterns were clinically realistic, but not consistent between groups. The coefficient of variation for synthetic tibias was >0.2 for both peak force and bending moment, which precludes their use as a reproducible test surrogate for injury prediction.Conclusions: Synthetic composite tibias offer the potential for developing a frangible test surrogate, and matched cadaveric response in several respects.

The difference between the two models lies in the inclusion or omission of the effect of involvement. Particular attention is focused on the effects due to the cell-to-cell transmission and the effect of the involvement. We investigate the local and global stability of equilibria of the two models and give a comparison. We derive the existence condition for Hopf bifurcation and prove no Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in this system. In particular, we show that the system exhibits the recurrence phenomenon, yielding complex dynamical behavior. It is also shown that the effect of the involvement is the main cause of the periodic symptoms in HIV or malaria disease. Moreover, it is shown that the increase of cell-to-cell interaction may be the main factor causing Hopf bifurcation to disappear, and thus eliminating oscillation behavior.

Telomerase activity is affected mostly by oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the association of telomerase activity with dietary quality indices has not been evaluated before. In the current work, we aimed to test the association of telomerase activity with dietary antioxidant quality score (DAQ), dietary inflammatory index and dietary patterns in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).In the current cross-sectional study, 454 candidates for the CABG were enrolled from Tehran Heart Center-Coronary Outcome Measurement (THC-COM) cohort. Laboratory measurements included Hb-A1C, serum lipid profile, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, lipoprotein (LP)-a, telomerase activity, serum vitamin D and C-reactive protein. Dietary status was measured by semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and dietary indices were calculated. Dietary patterns were extracted by factor analysis method.High telomerase activity was associated with lower prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) (P = 0.04), high dietary vitamin E and high total dietary antioxidant quality scores. Telomerase activity in top quartile of neo-traditional dietary pattern was higher than other quartiles (P = 0.021). No significant association between telomerase activity and other dietary patterns was obtained. Higher telomerase activity was also associated with higher serum creatinine and lower LP-(a) concentrations (P < 0.05).To our findings, higher telomerase activity was associated with higher DAQ and lower MI prevalence. It seems that adherence to healthy diet increases serum telomerase activity and reduced telomerase concentration is associated with increased cardio-metabolic risk factors.

We examine this regulation in the liver tissue of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) representing a biological model of hypometabolism and physiological stress resistance. The tissue levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins as well as galectin- and galectin- proteins detected by immunodot blot assay were significantly lower by 4.6–5.4-, 2.2–2.3- and 2.5–2.9-fold, respectively, in the non-hibernating summer squirrels compared with those in winter, whether hibernating or aroused.

Only the expression of LGALS gene in the liver tissue was significantly decreased by 37.6 ± 0.1% in hibernating ground squirrels relative to summer animals. Considering that the expression of a proven genetic biomarker ELOVL encoding ELOV fatty acid elongase 6 was readily upregulated in non-hibernating animals by 11.3–32.9-fold, marginal differential changes in the expression of galectin genes cannot be classified as biomarkers of hibernation. Thus, this study provides evidence that hibernation in Ictidomys tridecemlineatus is associated with increasing O-GlcNAcylation of liver proteins and suggests that the contribution of galectins deserves further studies at the protein level.",2020-03-10,Cell and Tissue Research,https://openalex.org/V139399906,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03185-x,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011968547,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03185-x,journal-article,3011968547

While the MDGs may have deepened our understanding in this regard, we know little about the trends in maternal health services utilisation among primigravidas, and how age and geographical regions could have influenced these trends. In this study, we examined utilisation of antenatal and skilled delivery services among primigravidas in Uganda, a country with one of the highest maternal mortality ratios, and where early childbearing and its attendant challenges are common. Methods Guided by Andersen’s Behavioural Model, we fitted multivariate regression models to a pooled dataset of the 2006, 201 and 2016 Ugandan Demographic and Health Survey ( n = 3477) to understand the dynamics in Antenatal Care (ANC) and Skilled Birth Attendance (SBAs) utilisation among primigravidas. Post-estimation margins were employed to further highlight the effect of age and geographical regions. Results The analyses show an improvement in access to maternal health services among primigravidas from 2006 to 2016. Compared to 2006, primigravidas in 2016 were 48%, 24% and 2.98 times more likely to have early ANC, four or more ANC visits, and SBAs, respectively. Altogether, a primigravida in 2016 relative to 2006 was 42% more likely to meet all three maternal health service indicators. Post-estimation margins analyses on age and geographical disparities revealed that younger primigravidas have lower probability, while primigravidas in Eastern Region, one of the most deprived in the country, have the lowest probability of accessing maternal health services. Also, the study found education, wealth, women’s household decision-making power, place of residence as important determinants of ANC visits and SBAs. Conclusions Based on our findings, it is important to address the vulnerabilities of primigravidas, particularly younger individuals, in accessing early ANC. Uganda should scale-up decentralisation and integration of maternal health delivery in local communities as a strategy of addressing lingering geographical disparities, and ultimately improve maternal health outcomes in the SDGs period.",2020-05-05,Globalization and Health,https://openalex.org/V112714904,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00570-7,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022826876,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00570-7,journal-article,3022826876

Surgical trainees’ perceptions of and receptiveness to cross-specialty assessment,"Abstract Introduction Competency-based medical education (CBME) hinges on robust assessment. However, integrating regular workplace-based assessment within demanding and sometimes chaotic clinical environments remains challenging. Many faculty lack assessment expertise, and some programs lack the infrastructure and faculty numbers to fulfill CBME’s mandate. Recognizing this, we designed and implemented an assessment innovation that trains and deploys a cadre of faculty to assess in specialties outside their own. Specifically, we explored trainees’ perceptions of and receptiveness to this novel assessment approach. Methods Within Western University’s Surgical Foundations program, 27 PGY‑1 trainees were formatively assessed by trained non-surgeons on a basic laparoscopic surgical skill. These assessments did not impact trainees’ progression. Four focus groups were conducted to gauge residents’ sentiments about the experience of cross-specialty assessment. Data were then analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results While a few trainees found the experience motivating, more often trainees questioned the feedback they received and the practicality of this assessment approach to advance their procedural skill acquisition. What trainees wanted were strategies for improvement, not merely an assessment of performance. Discussion Trainees’ trepidation at the idea of using outside assessors to meet increased assessment demands appeared grounded in their expectations for assessment. What trainees appeared to desire was a coach—someone who could break their performance into its critical individual components—as opposed to an assessor whose role was limited to scoring their performance. Understanding trainees’ receptivity to new assessment approaches is crucial; otherwise training programs run the risk of generating more assessments without added value.",2020-08-01,Perspectives on medical education,https://openalex.org/V2764699106,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-020-00594-0,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033565505,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-020-00594-0,journal-article,3033565505

The batch and column study was conducted to assess the As removal capacities from contaminated water. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the slag waste product determined the presence of large quantities of iron (Fe). In this study, the maximum removal capacities were found to be approximately 1.78 mg As per g of slag and 100% removal of As(V) was achieved during the first 3 days of three column operations. The changes in redox potential (Eh) values and the changes in effluent pH throughout the column operation period indicated redox reactions occurring in the system. The column experiments were modelled using a semi-analytic solution to the advection-dispersion-adsorption equation incorporated in the commercial software, Pollute V7. From the best-fit of the modelling results to the experimental breakthrough curves, the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient (D) was found to be 0.011 and 0.0077 m2/day for column  and column 2, respectively, and 0.0086 m2/day for column 3. The values of the distribution coefficient (KD) were 0.18, 0.17 and 0.17 m3/kg or L/g for the three columns and 0.2 L/g from the batch test.

GMMs that bridge seismological and empirical approaches are an effective tool to represent the distribution of ground motion and its uncertainty in seismic hazard assessment. A methodology is presented that uses ground-motion data recorded at seismograph sites in eastern North America and shows how they can be used to calibrate simple scalable seismological models of ground-motion generation and propagation. Such GMMs can directly account for the gross features of source scaling (magnitude and stress parameter), attenuation, site response, and kappa effects. It is shown that, by application of appropriate GMM strategies, sigma (aleatory uncertainty) could be greatly reduced, resulting in lower calculated hazard for nuclear plants founded on rock. This reduction in sigma requires that high-quality seismic monitoring (e.g., broadband seismograph stations) be installed and operated over a period of years (in addition to strong-motion stations), and that an ongoing investment be made in data analysis and targeted GMM development using the data.",2020-01-01,Pure and Applied Geophysics,https://openalex.org/V78180602,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00024-018-2044-1,2069,2081,177,5,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2900715094,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00024-018-2044-1,journal-article,2900715094

In addition to magnetic field line markings, relative magnetic force, or ratio of magnetic to gravitational forces on an object, may be considered a useful complementary metric to quantify the risk associated with bringing objects containing ferromagnetic material into the magnetic field. PURPOSE To develop and validate methods for deriving useful relative magnetic-force measures including a simple force index for application to MRI safety. STUDY TYPE Phantom. PHANTOM A special-purpose rig was built to experimentally measure relative magnetic forces on small ferromagnetic objects. FIELD STRENGTH Ranging from 1.5T to 7T. ASSESSMENT Quantitative comparisons were made between theoretical and measured relative magnetic forces on six objects containing ferromagnetic material: a piece of iron, a paper clip, a Kelly clamp, nail clippers, a cell phone, and a small permanent magnet. STATISTICAL TESTS An analysis based on the Bland-Altman method was employed. RESULTS After correction of the 1.5T data to account for assumed positioning errors of the test rig, limits of agreement between measured and estimated relative forces in the four MRI systems were ±0.16, where a relative force of 1.0 indicates that the magnetic force is equal to gravitation force. There was no significant bias in the data (P <  = 0.05). DATA CONCLUSION Accurate measures of relative magnetic forces on ferromagnetic objects can be derived for MRI safety purposes.

The hypothesis was tested with a large sample of managerial job candidates who completed an omnibus personality measure with 20 scales and a battery of intelligence measures (which was used to generate an intelligence factor). Following a median split along the intelligence factor, lower and higher intelligence groups were compared. The higher intelligence group was found to not be significantly more variable in terms of personality scale variances. Exploratory factor analyses suggested that a six-factor personality model was the best for each intelligence group.

We ask, how do voters actually assess the character of their current leaders? And, in light of the populist zeitgeist, do people who hold a populist attitude differ markedly in how they judge the character of political leaders? Our results show that voters generally consider character important. However, voters who lean toward populism believe character matters less in political leadership than individuals who scored low on the populism indicator. This durable difference merits more exploration in a political context marked by populism.

Among persons who inject drugs, sharing of needles/syringes is less common and leads to a smaller proportion of incident cases than does sharing of injection drug preparation equipment. In Canada and Europe, hydromorphone controlled release has been associated with frequent reuse and sharing of IDPE. Drug excipients within HCR have been shown to preserve virus survival within IDPE. We hypothesized that regional differences in HCV incidence would mirror regional differences in HCR prescribing. We reviewed HCV incidence data across Ontario, Canada for 2016. Opioid prescribing patterns in each Health Unit were reviewed. Multivariable Poisson regression analyses were performed to test the strength of hydromorphone controlled release dispensing patterns in explaining HCV incidence compared to all opioids. Less vehicle access, lack of education, lower income, less population density, higher white race/ethnicity and more opioid substitution therapy recipients remained significant positive predictors of hepatitis C incidence in the Ontario model. Higher hydromorphone controlled release dispensing rate was a stronger predictor of HCV incidence than all opioid prescriptions (standardized risk ratio = 1.17, P < .0001 vs sRR = 1.11, P = .02). When hydromorphone controlled release was excluded from the opioid prescription variable, dispensing patterns of all other opioids no longer remained a significant predictor (sRR = 1.042, P = .34). The observed relationship between HCV incidence and hydromorphone controlled release dispensing suggests that the type of opioid prescribed locally may contribute to variations in HCV incidence. These data add support to evidence that hydromorphone controlled release use is contributing to HCV spread in Ontario.",2020-04-08,Journal of Viral Hepatitis,https://openalex.org/V164225461,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13292,774,780,27,8,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012226782,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13292,journal-article,3012226782

Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst professionals may facilitate the elaboration of comprehensive oncological treatment plans. As the application of IPC in the delivery of BR has not yet been studied, we undertook a qualitative study to explore the perceptions of physicians and administrators on IPC in breast cancer care and how these impact BR delivery. Interviews were conducted with 3 participants (22 physicians and  administrators). Physician interviews focused on their personal beliefs and values regarding BR, while administrator interviews explored their institutional treatment regimens as well as the availability of a BR program. Our thematic analysis was informed by the Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative (CIHC) competency framework. IPC challenges were thought by participants to affect the delivery of BR. At the physician level, a lack of role clarity as well as the absence of an explicitly established leader negatively influence collaboration in BR delivery. In addition, varying views on the usefulness of BR and on the role of plastic surgeons in breast oncological teams discourage positive collaboration, rendering the delivery of BR more difficult. The delivery of BR is overall impaired due to a lack of effective IPC. IPC could be improved through clarifying physician roles, establishing clear leadership, and aligning viewpoints on quality oncological care in collaborative teams; ultimately, this may promote equitable BR delivery for breast cancer patients.",2020-04-15,Annals of Surgical Oncology,https://openalex.org/V177486402,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08463-0,2299,2310,27,7,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016971867,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08463-0,journal-article,3016971867

In humans, numerous cell stimulation pathways lead to the mobilization of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (S/ER) stored Ca2+, resulting in the propagation of Ca2+ signals through the activation of processes, such as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE provides a sustained Ca2+ entry into the cytosol; moreover, the uptake of SOCE-mediated Ca2+ by mitochondria can shape cytosolic Ca2+ signals, function as a feedback signal for the SOCE molecular machinery, and drive numerous mitochondrial processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and distinct cell death pathways. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in identifying the proteins mediating these signaling pathways and elucidating molecular structures, invaluable for understanding the underlying mechanisms of function. Nevertheless, there remains a disconnect between using this accumulating protein structural knowledge and the design of new research tools and therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the Ca2+ signaling pathways that are involved in mediating S/ER stored Ca2+ release, SOCE, and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, as well as pinpoint multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways. Further, we highlight the significant protein structures elucidated in recent years controlling these Ca2+ signaling pathways. Finally, we describe a simple strategy that aimed at applying the protein structural data to initiating drug design.",2020-05-21,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,https://openalex.org/V10623703,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21103642,3642,3642,21,10,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3027188053,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21103642,journal-article,3027188053

This study used linked population-based databases to describe the regional proportion of immigrants in the context of provincial health region variation in premature mortality. Methods We analyzed all adult premature deaths in Ontario from 1992 to 201 using linked population files, Canadian census, and death registry databases. Geographic boundaries were analyzed according to 1 health service regions, known as Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). We assessed the role of immigrant status and regional proportion of immigrants in the context of these health region variations and assessed the contribution using sex-specific multilevel negative binomial models, accounting for age, individual- and area-level immigration, and area-level material deprivation. Results We observed significant premature mortality variation among health service regions in Ontario between 1992 and 2012. Average annual rates ranged across LHINs from 3.0 to 6.40 per 1000 among males and 2.04 to 3.9 per 1000 among females. The median rate ratio (RR) decreased for men from 1.1 (95% CI 1.06, 1.19) to 1.0 (95% CI 1.00, 1.11) after adjusting for year, age, area-based material deprivation, and individual- and area-level immigration, and among females reduced from 1.1 (95% CI 1.05, 1.18) to 1.0 (95% CI 1.00, 1.05). These adjustments explained 84.1% and 94.4% of the LHIN-level variation in males and females respectively. Reduced premature mortality rates were associated with immigrants compared with those for long-term residents in the fully adjusted models for both males 0.4 (95% CI 0.42, 0.44) and females 0.4 (0.44, 0.46). Conclusion The findings demonstrate that health region differences in premature mortality in Ontario are in part explained by individual-level effects associated with the health advantage of immigrants, as well as contextual area-level effects that are associated with regional differences in the immigrant population. These factors should be considered in addition to health system factors when looking at health region variation in premature deaths.",2020-05-27,Canadian Journal of Public Health-revue Canadienne De Sante Publique,https://openalex.org/V73868107,Canadian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00330-5,322,332,111,3,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3032431674,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00330-5,journal-article,3032431674

Yet, its use has not yet gained momentum primarily due to limited knowledge of its structural performance. This study explores the structural behavior of full-scale 1050 mm and 1200 mm diameter RCP reinforced with SE cold drawn steel wire cage under the three-edge bearing test. Experimental results show that, given similar amount of reinforcing steel at the tension zone of the inner face of the invert and obvert of the pipe, RCP with SE reinforcing cage meets lower equivalent class than that of RCP with conventional double reinforcing cage. The absence of a second layer of reinforcement in the SE pipes produced more brittle failure characterized by radial tension, followed by concrete slabbing. Increasing the steel reinforcement ratio improved the 0.3-mm crack load and ultimate load capacity up to a certain threshold, beyond which adding more steel did not enhance the results. Results indicate that RCP with SE reinforcement designed per current standards did not meet the specified 0.3-mm crack and ultimate load capacity. Hence, pertinent provisions in CSA A257.2 and ASTM C76 for RCP need to be updated with specific and more suitable guidance for single elliptical cage RCP.",2020-09-15,Engineering Structures,https://openalex.org/V165454098,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110881,110881,110881,219,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3033437765,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110881,journal-article,3033437765

Our setting offers flexibility to accommodate stylized facts of asset returns like dynamic conditional correlation and a covariance dependent pricing kernel. The model admits a closed-form recursive representation for the moment generating function under both historical and risk-neutral measures, permitting efficient multi-asset option pricing and risk management calculations. We illustrate the applicability and impact of our framework on the five assets for which volatility indices are made publicly available, together with the S&P 500 Index. We demonstrate that our methodology is remarkably faster than Monte Carlo simulation when pricing two-assets options. We confirm the importance of incorporating a covariance-dependent pricing kernel compared to a linear pricing kernel by reporting large and economically significant changes in the price of two-asset options. Similarly, our single-factor Index model structure for the marginal can lead to differences of up to 70% in the price of single-asset options and empirical option pricing errors that are up to 41% smaller than what is obtained with a univariate model with a linear pricing kernel.",2020-07-08,Journal of Banking and Finance,https://openalex.org/V2876017,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2020.105895,105895,105895,118,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3041454691,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2020.105895,journal-article,3041454691

Design and setting A cross-sectional study conducted in Canada (excluding Québec) using data from the 2006 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) linked prospectively to hospitalisation records from the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) for the three fiscal years: 2006–2007, 2007–2008 and 2008–2009. Primary outcome measure Preventable hospitalisations (ACSC). Participants The 2006 CanCHEC represents a population of 2 56 12 individuals in Canada (excluding Québec). Of this number,  94 15 (13.03%) individuals were estimated to be hospitalised at least once during the 2006–2009 fiscal years. Methods Age-standardised annualised ACSC hospitalisation rates per 10 0 population were computed for each of the 1 Census Divisions. To assess the magnitude of Census Division-level geographic variation in rates of preventable hospitalisations, the global Moran’s I statistic was computed. ‘Hot spot’ analysis was used to identify the pattern of geographic variation. Results Of all the hospitalisation events reported in Canada during the 2006–2009 fiscal years, 3 9 (7.10%) events were ACSC-related hospitalisations. The Moran’s I statistic (Moran’s I =0.355) suggests non-randomness in the spatial distribution of preventable hospitalisations.

Th2-mediated inflammation is a characteristic of allergic asthma. We have shown that the levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells in the peripheral blood of patients with asthma are associated with severity and/or control of the disease. To improve our understanding of the interactions between stress and asthma symptoms, we evaluated the effects of psychological comorbidity on Th2-mediated inflammation in patients with asthma. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty-six asthmatic patients were recruited from the University of Alberta Asthma Clinic after they gave informed consent. Stress-related effects on asthma and psychological morbidity were assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire, completed by the patients at recruitment. Venous blood was collected at recruitment and Th2-mediated immunity evaluated by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <h3>Findings</h3> Patients with stress-triggered asthma (n = 12) had higher percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and Th2 cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CRTh2<sup>+</sup> T cells; <i>P</i> = 0.002) in peripheral blood compared to patients with asthma who did not experience stress-related worsening of disease (n = 54). The same was true when we analyzed patients with any form of psychological comorbidity (n = 19) compared to those without psychological comorbidities (n = 47). These differences were evident among women, but not among men. Women with psychological comorbidity also required higher doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids compared to those without psychological comorbidity. <h3>Implications</h3> Asthma involving psychological morbidity associates with an elevated level of circulating Th2 cells and increased corticosteroid usage, and may be more prevalent in women. Larger-scale prospective studies are required for assessing whether these women constitute a new endotype of Th2-high asthma responsive to treatments aimed to improve psychological comorbidities.",2020-06-01,Clinical Therapeutics,https://openalex.org/V185879095,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.05.001,1015,1031,42,6,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3029612300,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.05.001,journal-article,3029612300
