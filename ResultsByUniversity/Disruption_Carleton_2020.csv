The functional relationship in the affine form between the nonlinear functions with whole state and error variables is established by using the structure consistency of intermediate control signals and the variable-partition technique. The fuzzy control and adaptive backstepping schemes are applied to construct an improved fault-tolerant controller without requiring the specific knowledge of control gains and actuator faults, including both stuck constant value and loss of effectiveness. The proposed fault-tolerant controller ensures that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally practically finite-time stable and the tracking error remains in a small neighborhood of the origin after a finite period of time. The developed control method is verified through two numerical examples.",2020-05-01,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,https://openalex.org/V4210191041,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2019.2902868,1786,1797,50,5,0,119,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2944466752,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2019.2902868,journal-article,2944466752

Yet these factors are key constraints to attempts to ‘decouple' human well-being from energy use and climate change emissions. In this critical review paper, we identify some of the main political-economic factors behind car dependence, drawing together research from several fields. Five key constituent elements of what we call the ‘car-dependent transport system’ are identified: i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure; iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; iv) the provision of public transport; v) cultures of car consumption. Using the ‘systems of provision’ approach within political economy, we locate the part played by each element within the key dynamic processes of the system as a whole. Such processes encompass industrial structure, political-economic relations, the built environment, and cultural feedback loops. We argue that linkages between these processes are crucial to maintaining car dependence and thus create carbon lock-in. In developing our argument we discuss several important characteristics of car-dependent transport systems: the role of integrated socio-technical aspects of provision, the opportunistic use of contradictory economic arguments serving industrial agendas, the creation of an apolitical facade around pro-car decision-making, and the ‘capture’ of the state within the car-dependent transport system. Through uncovering the constituents, processes and characteristics of car-dependent transport systems, we show that moving past the automobile age will require an overt and historically aware political program of research and action.",2020-08-01,Energy research and social science,https://openalex.org/V2764593084,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101486,101486,101486,66,,1,110,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3011774154,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101486,journal-article,3011774154

Meanwhile, practitioners –architects, engineers, technology companies, building managers and operators, and policymakers – lack the knowledge, tools, and precedent to design and operate buildings optimally considering the complex and diverse nature of occupants. Building on the success of IEA EBC Annex 6 (“Definition and simulation of occupant behavior in buildings”; 2013–2017), a follow-up IEA EBC Annex 79 (“Occupant-centric building design and operation”; 2018–2023) has been developed to address gaps in knowledge, practice, and technology. Annex 79 involves international researchers from diverse disciplines like engineering, architecture, computer science, psychology, and sociology. Annex 79 and this review paper have four main areas of focus: (1) multi-domain environmental exposure, building interfaces, and human behavior; (2) data-driven occupant modeling strategies and digital tools; (3) occupant-centric building design; and (4) occupant-centric building operation.

Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS > SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims: Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS > SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location: Global. Time period: 1976–2018. Major taxa: Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods: Literature review. Results: Like previous reviews, I found that SS > SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS > SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL > SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL > SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions: Most empirical comparisons find SS > SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play.

Coral reef fishes are predicted to be especially susceptible to end-of-century ocean acidification on the basis of several high-profile papers4,5 that have reported profound behavioural and sensory impairments-for example, complete attraction to the chemical cues of predators under conditions of ocean acidification. Here, we comprehensively and transparently show that-in contrast to previous studies-end-of-century ocean acidification levels have negligible effects on important behaviours of coral reef fishes, such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators, fish activity levels and behavioural lateralization (left-right turning preference). Using data simulations, we additionally show that the large effect sizes and small within-group variances that have been reported in several previous studies are highly improbable. Together, our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans.",2020-01-08,Nature,https://openalex.org/V137773608,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1903-y,370,375,577,7790,1,65,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999001800,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1903-y,journal-article,2999001800

In this respect, a two-layer strategy is proposed to share the power among four FCSs and a battery pack. The first layer (local to each FCS) is held solely responsible for constantly determining the real maximum power and efficiency of each stack since the operating conditions variation and ageing noticeably influence stacks’ performance. This layer is composed of a FCS semi-empirical model and a Kalman filter. The utilized filter updates the FCS model parameters to compensate for the FCSs’ performance drifts. The second layer (global management) is held accountable for splitting the power among components. This layer uses two inputs per each FCS, updated maximum power and efficiency, as well as the battery state of charge (SOC) and powertrain demanded power to perform the power sharing. The proposed EMS, called adaptive state machine strategy, employs the first two inputs to sort the FCSs out and the other inputs to do the power allocation. The ultimate results of the suggested strategy are compared with two commonly used power sharing methods, namely Daisy Chain and Equal Distribution. The results of the suggested EMS indicate promising improvement in the overall performance of the system.

Therefore, to accurately capture the dynamic nature of the occupants' movement patterns, researchers have proposed various indoor localisation technologies to infer occupancy information with varying degrees of accuracy and resolution. Among these technologies, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology emerged as a popular alternative due to its availability in smartphone devices, as well as its low cost and power demand. In this study, we proposed a scalable and less intrusive occupancy detection method that leverages existing BLE technologies found in smartphone devices to perform zone-level occupancy localisation, without the need for a mobile application. The proposed method uses a network of BLE beacons for data collection before passing the pre-processed data into a machine learning model to infer the occupants' zone-level location. A supervised ensemble model and a semi-supervised clustering model were proposed and evaluated to identify the best performing model. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated during a five-week case study involving two office spaces in an academic building in Singapore.

Nevertheless, it is impractical to achieve perfect acquisition of the local models in wireless communication due to the noise, which also brings serious effect on federated learning. To tackle this challenge in this paper, we propose a robust design for federated learning to decline the effect of noise. Considering the noise in two aforementioned steps, we first formulate the training problem as a parallel optimization for each node under the expectation-based model and worst-case model. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, regularizer approximation method is proposed to make it tractable. Regarding the worst-case model, we utilize the sampling-based successive convex approximation algorithm to develop a feasible training scheme to tackle the unavailable maxima or minima noise condition and the non-convex issue of the objective function. Furthermore, the convergence rates of both new designs are analyzed from a theoretical point of view.

Participants were 39 Chilean preschool children and their parents. Children completed numeracy and literacy tasks at the beginning of preschool (mean age:  years and  months) and approximately  months later. Parents reported on the home numeracy activities they engaged in with their children, including formal (i.e., mapping and operational), informal (i.e., parents’ number-game knowledge), and home literacy activities (i.e., code-related and meaning-related), as well as on numeracy and literacy attitudes and expectations for children’s performance prior to Grade 1. We found that parents with more positive numeracy attitudes and higher academic expectations reported a higher frequency of formal numeracy (mapping and operational) activities. In turn, formal operational activities predicted number line estimation and applied problem-solving skills. In contrast, informal activities (i.e., parents’ number-game knowledge) predicted children’s non-symbolic arithmetic and non-symbolic number comparison tasks, as well as their applied problem-solving skills. The links between home activities and numeracy outcomes were domain specific: Parents’ reports of literacy activities did not predict early numeracy skills.

Many studies use the program structure combined with the ΔK method to identify the most probable number of populations (K). We recently found K = 2 was identified more often when studies used ΔK compared to studies that did not. We suggested two reasons for this: hierarchical population structure leads to underestimation, or the ΔK method does not evaluate K =  causing an overestimation. The present contribution aims to develop a better understanding of the limits of the method using one, two and three population simulations across migration scenarios. From these simulations we identified the “best K” using model likelihood and ΔK. Our findings show that mean probability plots and ΔK are unable to resolve the correct number of populations once migration rate exceeds 0.005. We also found a strong bias towards selecting K = 2 using the ΔK method. We used these data to identify the range of values where the ΔK statistic identifies a value of K that is not well supported. Finally, using the simulations and a review of empirical data, we found that the magnitude of ΔK corresponds to the level of divergence between populations. Based on our findings, we suggest researchers should use the ΔK method cautiously; they need to report all relevant data, including the magnitude of ΔK, and an estimate of connectivity for the research community to assess whether meaningful genetic structure exists within the context of management and conservation.",2020-03-01,Molecular Ecology,https://openalex.org/V22454499,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15374,862,869,29,5,1,36,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005201051,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15374,journal-article,3005201051

Upon the addition of HER2, HER2 binds specifically with its aptamer, releasing the gold nanoparticles. Addition of NaCl then induces the formation of gold nanoparticle aggregates. This leads to a color change from red to blue and a detection limit of 1 nM was achieved. The second method used an adsorption-desorption colorimetric lateral flow assay approach wherein biotin-modified aptamers were adsorbed onto the gold nanoparticle surface in the absence of HER2. In the presence of HER2, HER2 specifically binds with its aptamer leading to release of the gold nanoparticles. These solutions were applied to the lateral flow assay format and a detection limit of 2 nM was achieved. Both colorimetric and lateral flow assays are inexpensive, simple, rapid to perform and produce results visible to the naked-eye.",2020-01-01,Analytical Biochemistry,https://openalex.org/V7858788,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2019.113471,113471,113471,588,,0,34,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980146966,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2019.113471,journal-article,2980146966

Intensively studied for systems of autonomous mobile robots, it has recently been investigated in the realm of programmable matter, where entities are assumed to be small and with severely limited capabilities. Namely, it has been studied in the geometric Amoebot model, where the anonymous entities, called particles, operate on a hexagonal tessellation of the plane and have limited computational power (they have constant memory), strictly local interaction and communication capabilities (only with particles in neighboring nodes of the grid), and limited motorial capabilities (from a grid node to an empty neighboring node); their activation is controlled by an adversarial scheduler. Recent investigations have shown how, starting from a well-structured configuration in which the particles form a (not necessarily complete) triangle, the particles can form a large class of shapes. This result has been established under several assumptions: agreement on the clockwise direction (i.e., chirality), a sequential activation schedule, and randomization (i.e., particles can flip coins to elect a leader). In this paper we obtain several results that, among other things, provide a characterization of which shapes can be formed deterministically starting from any simply connected initial configuration of n particles. The characterization is constructive: we provide a universal shape formation algorithm that, for each feasible pair of shapes $$(S_0, S_F)$$, allows the particles to form the final shape $$S_F$$ (given in input) starting from the initial shape $$S_0$$, unknown to the particles. The final configuration will be an appropriate scaled-up copy of $$S_F$$ depending on n. If randomization is allowed, then any input shape can be formed from any initial (simply connected) shape by our algorithm, provided that there are enough particles. Our algorithm works without chirality, proving that chirality is computationally irrelevant for shape formation. Furthermore, it works under a strong adversarial scheduler, not necessarily sequential. We also consider the complexity of shape formation both in terms of the number of rounds and the total number of moves performed by the particles executing a universal shape formation algorithm. We prove that our solution has a complexity of $$O(n^2)$$ rounds and moves: this number of moves is also asymptotically worst-case optimal.",2020-02-01,Distributed Computing,https://openalex.org/V139349430,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00446-019-00350-6,69,101,33,1,1,28,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2963533232,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00446-019-00350-6,journal-article,2963533232

The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 1 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review.

Our framework identifies four distinct types of IIoT business models: (I) Company-specific business models, (II) Systemic business models, (III) Value designs, and (IV) Systemic value designs. Moreover, it sheds light on different abstraction levels of business model building blocks and exposes the characteristics and differences in the value potential between the four business models.

We tested an integrative model in which CEO beliefs about diversity were theorized to predict the implementation of organizational diversity practices through two consecutive mediating steps—via greater CEO engagement in pro-diversity behavior, and in turn, higher perceived CEO commitment by their HR manager. In this model, we also proposed a moderating effect such that when CEOs have less positive beliefs about diversity, CEOs espousing higher moral values will display greater pro-diversity behavior.

In this brief, a novel time series-based method for detecting fall incidents in human daily activities is proposed. A time series in the slow-time is obtained by summing all the range bins corresponding to fast-time of the ultra wideband radar return signals. This time series is used as input to the proposed deep convolutional neural network for automatic feature extraction. In contrast to other existing methods, the proposed fall detection method relies on multi-level feature learning directly from the radar time series signals. In particular, the proposed method utilizes a deep convolutional neural network for automating feature extraction as well as global maximum pooling technique for enhancing model discriminability. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the state-of-the-art, such as recurrent neural network, multi-layer perceptron, and dynamic time warping techniques.

The distinctive characteristics exhibited by accelerators, relative to previous incubation models, imply that accelerators may play a different role and have a different impact on the survival rates of participating firms. In this study, we explore the relationship between participation in an accelerator program and firm survival using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) with key variables related to firm survival. We analyze 38 accelerated startups from five Italian accelerators and a control group of 38 non-accelerated Italian startups. Our findings support the business accelerator literature that regards accelerators as a new and distinct generation of business incubators. Our results suggest that participation in accelerator programs on its own does not influence firm survival. However, we found a relationship between firm survival and accelerated technology-based firms that do not export and between firm survival and accelerated firms in the service sector with a small team that do not export.

To determine how age and ovulation underlie ovarian cancer risk, we assessed the effects of these risk factors on the ovarian microenvironment. Experimental Design: Aged C57/lcrfa mice (0–33 months old) were generated to assess the aged ovarian microenvironment. To expand our findings into human aging, we assembled a cohort of normal human ovaries (n = 18, 21–71 years old). To validate our findings, an independent cohort of normal human ovaries was assembled (n = 9, 41–82 years old). Results: We first validated the presence of age-associated murine ovarian fibrosis. Using interdisciplinary methodologies, we provide novel evidence that ovarian fibrosis also develops in human postmenopausal ovaries across two independent cohorts (n = 27). Fibrotic ovaries have an increased CD206+:CD68+ cell ratio, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and profibrotic DPP4+αSMA+ fibroblasts. Metformin use was associated with attenuated CD8+ T-cell infiltration and reduced CD206+:CD68+ cell ratio. Conclusions: These data support a novel hypothesis that unifies the primary nonhereditary ovarian cancer risk factors through the development of ovarian fibrosis and the formation of a premetastatic niche, and suggests a potential use for metformin in ovarian cancer prophylaxis.

How and when these two structures formed, and whether they are fixed and long lived through Earth history or dynamic and linked to the supercontinent cycles, remain first-order geodynamic questions. Hotspots and large igneous provinces (LIPs) are mostly generated above LLSVPs, and it is widely accepted that the African LLSVP existed by at least ca. 20 Ma beneath the supercontinent Pangea. Whereas the continental LIP record has been used to decipher the spatial and temporal variations of plume activity under the continents, plume records of the oceanic realm before ca. 17 Ma are mostly missing due to oceanic subduction. Here, we present the first compilation of an Oceanic Large Igneous Provinces database (O-LIPdb), which represents the preserved oceanic LIP and oceanic island basalt occurrences preserved in ophiolites. Using this database, we are able to reconstruct and compare the record of mantle plume activity in both the continental and oceanic realms for the past  b.y., spanning three supercontinent cycles. Time-series analysis reveals hints of similar cyclicity of the plume activity in the continent and oceanic realms, both exhibiting a periodicity of ∼500 m.y. that is comparable to the supercontinent cycle, albeit with a slight phase delay.

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem and is thus challenging to solve. We propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization, by iteratively solving one of the three subproblems (i.e., user association, resource allocation and basesation placement) with the other two fixed. Specificly, user association is solved as a standard linear programming problem by relaxing the binary association indicators into continuous variables. For basestation placement and resource allocation, we resort to successive convex optimization technique, which iteratively solves a lower-bound problem. After iteratively solving the three subproblems, we further propose an algorithm based on penalty method and successive convex optimization to make the association indicators feasibly binary. We conduct comprehensive experiments for the optimal solution to the three subproblems with insightful results. We also show that the optimal downlink sum rate cannot be always enhanced by deploying more UAVs due to non-negligible tradeoff between energy/communication sources and co-channel interference. Moreover, the proposed solution outperforms a baseline strategy leveraged from an existing work, especially with favorable channel condition and sufficient frequency resources.",2020-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,https://openalex.org/V10936095,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2019.2960765,2171,2184,69,2,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2995268338,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2019.2960765,journal-article,2995268338

Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, NMRs), eusocial mammals that live in large colonies, are among the most mammals, and rely almost solely on decreases in metabolism with little change in ventilation during hypoxia. We hypothesized that the remarkable hypoxia tolerance of NMRs is an evolutionarily conserved trait derived from repeated exposure to severe hypoxia owing to their burrow environment and eusocial colony organization. Methods We used whole-body plethysmography and indirect calorimetry to measure the hypoxic ventilatory and metabolic responses of eight mole-rat species closely related to the NMR. Results We found that all eight species examined had a strong tolerance to hypoxia, with most species tolerating  kPa O2 , Heliophobius emini tolerating  kPa O2 and Bathyergus suillus tolerating  kPa O2 . All species examined employed a combination of increases in ventilation and decreases in metabolism in hypoxia, a response midway between that of the NMR and that of other fossorial species (larger ventilatory responses, lesser reductions in metabolism). We found that eusociality is not fundamental to the physiological response to hypoxia of NMRs as Fukomys damarensis, another eusocial species, was among this group. Conclusions Our data suggest that, while the NMR is unique in the pattern of their physiological response to hypoxia, eight closely related mole-rat species share the ability to tolerate hypoxia like the current hypoxia-tolerant champion, the NMR.",2020-04-01,Acta Physiologica,https://openalex.org/V204890612,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13436,,,228,4,0,23,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998139543,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13436,journal-article,2998139543

UAVs can collect massive heterogeneous data from disaster-affected areas using fifth-generation (5G)/beyond 5G networks and this data can be analyzed to get the information required by the first responders such as marking the boundary of the affected area, identifying the infrastructure damaged and the roads blocked, and the health situation of people living in that area. This paper presents an overview of different platforms (UAVs-based, IoT-based, and IoT, coupled with UAVs) for disaster management. We propose an energy-efficient task scheduling scheme for data collection by UAVs from the ground IoT network. The focus is to optimize the path taken by the UAVs to minimize energy consumption. We also analyze the vital signs data collected by UAVs for people in disaster-affected areas and apply the decision tree classification algorithm to determine their health risk status.

Thus, we assessed the role of LRRK2 in the context of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)-induced inflammation of the substantia nigra together with the environmental toxicant, paraquat, that has been implicated in PD. Here we found that LRRK2 ablation prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits (motor) induced by LPS priming followed by paraquat exposure. The LRRK2 ablation also provoked a phenotypic shift in LPS-primed microglia cells. The LRRK2 deficiency reduced their “activated” morphology and upregulation of the inflammatory phagocytic regulator, WAVE2 (critical for actin remodeling), while the chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, was elevated in isolated CD11b+ myeloid cells. Furthermore, LRRK2 knockout attenuated the signs of oxidative stress and morphological changes induced in primary microglia by LPS treatment. However, induced WAVE2 expression together with LPS exposure in microglia overcame the inhibitory effects of LRRK2 knockout, suggesting WAVE2 may be acting downstream of LRRK2. Neither WAVE2 nor did LRRK2 knockout influence LPS-induced cytokine elevations in the microglia. We are the first to show the importance of LRRK2 in neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes in this multi-hit toxin model of PD. These data are consistent with the proposition that LRRK2 and WAVE2 are useful therapeutic targets for PD or other conditions with a prominent neuroinflammatory component. • LRRK2 deficiency was neuroprotective against a double hit, LPS and paraquat, model. • LRRK2 is important for programming the neuroinflammatory phenotype of microglia. • WAVE2 is an important microglial factor potentially downstream of LRRK2 in the context of inflammatory toxin exposure. • LRRK2 and WAVE2 might be important regulatory factors in Parkinson's disease.",2020-02-27,Neurobiology of Aging,https://openalex.org/V284573,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2020.02.017,45,55,91,,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007831122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2020.02.017,journal-article,3007831122

Mudflats are an important part of the intertidal zone and experience extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Therein, species would be potentially susceptible to global warming. The present study explored physiological adaptations of burrowing species to life in an intertidal mudflat by analyzing the potential operative temperatures in the mudflat, and assessing cardiac performance and the transcriptional response to thermal stress by a typical burrowing bivalve, the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta in different thermal environments, mimicking conditions during low tides. Clams showed higher thermal sublethal limits in mud with overlying air than in mud with overlying water, indicating an adaptation to rapidly changing ambient temperatures and thermal environments during emersion. This sublethal limit was far above the maximum operative temperature in the actual habitat site and suggests a potential buffer zone to ensure survival under unexpected high temperatures, that could occur with global warming. In response to high temperature, S. constricta exhibited the common heat stress response by up-regulating expression of the Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) and heat shock proteins to cope with the adverse effects of high temperature on protein homeostasis. Increased expression of key genes, including molybdenum cofactor synthesis 3 (MOCS3), oligoribonuclease (REX2), and NFκappaB inhibitor alpha (NFIA) may further remit the effect of thermal stress during the emersion period and delay a situation where clams reach their thermal sublethal limit, thereby helping to endure high temperature during low tide. These results clearly illustrate significant adaptations of a burrowing bivalve to life in intertidal mudflats at both physiological and molecular levels and can provide insights into potential physiological or evolutionary responses that could aid survival of mudflat species in a changing global climate.",2020-03-25,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136280,136280,136280,710,,0,21,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997252427,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136280,journal-article,2997252427

The diverse pathways regulated by AKT1 are communicated in the cell via the phosphorylation of perhaps more than 10 cellular substrates. AKT1 is itself activated by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473. Despite the fact that these phosphorylation sites are biomarkers for cancers and tumor biology, their individual roles in shaping AKT1 substrate selectivity are unknown. We recently developed a method to produce AKT1 with programmed phosphorylation at either or both of its key regulatory sites. Here, we used both defined and randomized peptide libraries to map the substrate selectivity of site-specific, singly and doubly phosphorylated AKT1 variants. To globally quantitate AKT1 substrate preferences, we synthesized three AKT1 substrate peptide libraries: one based on 8 substrates and two independent and larger oriented peptide array libraries (OPALs) of ∼1011 peptides each. We found that each phospho-form of AKT1 has common and distinct substrate requirements. Compared with pAKT1T308, the addition of Ser-473 phosphorylation increased AKT1 activities on some, but not all of its substrates. This is the first report that Ser-473 phosphorylation can positively or negatively regulate kinase activity in a substrate-dependent fashion. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the OPAL-activity data effectively discriminate known AKT1 substrates from closely related kinase substrates.

Due to power and memory restrictions in wearable devices, signal acquisition may need to be done in smaller segments using compressive sensing (CS) techniques. However such acquisitions may lead to poor recovery of compressed measurements. A Kronecker-based novel recovery technique has been recently proposed to improve the recovery of compressed signals where the recovery is achieved through a single recovery of concatenated compressed signal segments. In this article, a mathematical reasoning for improvement using the Kronecker-based recovery over standard CS recovery procedure is presented. A detailed investigation of Kronecker-based recovery technique of compressed ECG signal is presented using ECG signals from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. As a part of this investigation, the quality of recovery with random and deterministic sensing of ECG signals and impact of choice of sparsifying dictionaries under various compression ratios (CRs) are considered.

Besides its direct associated cost; high energy consumption also results in a large amount of CO2 emission and incurs extra cooling expenditure. The foremost reason for overly energy consumption is the underutilization of data center resources. In modern data centers, virtualization provides a promising approach to improve the hardware utilization level. Virtual machine placement is a process of mapping a group of virtual machines (VMs) onto a set of physical machines (PMs) in a data center with the aim of maximizing resource utilization and minimizing the total power consumption by PMs. An optimal virtual machine placement algorithm substantially contributes to cutting down the power consumption through assigning the input VMs to a minimum number of PMs and allowing the dispensable PMs to be turned off. However, VM Placement Problem is a complex combinatorial optimization problem and known to be NP-Hard problem. This paper presents an extensive review of virtual machine placement problem along with an overview of different approaches for solving virtual machine placement problem. The aim of this paper is to illuminate challenges and issues for current virtual machine placement techniques. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of virtual machine placement based on various aspects such as methodology, number of objectives, operation mode, problem objectives, resource demand type and number of clouds.

Carbonatites and associated phonolites and nephelinites from Oldoinyo Lengai have similar δ 137/134 Ba values that range from +0.0 to +0.03‰, indicating that Ba isotope fractionation during carbonatite petrogenesis is negligible. The limited variation in δ 137/134 Ba values from −0.03 to +0.09‰ for most carbonatite samples suggests that their mantle sources have a relatively homogeneous Ba isotopic composition.

Automated segmentation of myocardial scar is critical for the potential clinical translation of this technique given the number of tomographic images acquired. Methods: In this paper, we describe the development of cascaded multi-planar U-Net (CMPU-Net) to efficiently segment the boundary of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium and scar from 3D LGE-MR images. In this approach, two subnets, each containing three U-Nets, were cascaded to first segment the LV myocardium and then segment the scar within the presegmented LV myocardium. The U-Nets were trained separately using two-dimensional (2D) slices extracted from axial, sagittal, and coronal slices of 3D LGE-MR images. We used 3D LGE-MR images from 3 subjects with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The U-Nets were trained using 843 slices, extracted in three orthogonal directions from 1 images. In the testing phase, the outputs of U-Nets of each subnet were combined using the majority voting system for final label prediction of each voxel in the image. The developed method was tested for accuracy by comparing its results to manual segmentations of LV myocardium and LV scar from 725 slices extracted from 1 3D LGE-MR images. Our method was also compared to numerous alternative methods based on machine learning, energy minimization, and intensity-thresholds. Results: Our algorithm reported a mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC), absolute volume difference (AVD), and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 85.14% ± 3.36%, 43.72 ± 27.18 cm3, and 19.21 ± 4.74 mm for determining the boundaries of LV myocardium from LGE-MR images. Our method also yielded a mean DSC, AVD, and HD of 88.61% ± 2.54%, 9.33 ± 7.24 cm3, and 17.04 ± 9.93 mm for LV scar segmentation on the unobserved test dataset.

We have previously shown that direct exposure of mouse and human islets (endocrine pancreas) to the highly persistent pollutant TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin) causes reduced insulin secretion ex vivo . Furthermore, a single high-dose of TCDD (20 µg/kg) suppressed both fasting and glucose-induced plasma insulin levels and promoted beta-cell apoptosis after  days in male mice. The current study investigated the longer-term effects of a single high-dose TCDD injection (2 µg/kg) on glucose metabolism and beta cell function in male and female C57Bl/6 mice. TCDD-exposed males displayed modest fasting hypoglycemia for ~4 weeks post-injection, reduced fasting insulin levels for up to 6 weeks, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased beta cell area, and increased delta cell area. TCDD-exposed females also had long-term suppressed basal plasma insulin levels, and abnormal insulin secretion for up to 6 weeks. Unlike males, TCDD did not impact insulin sensitivity or islet composition in females, but did cause transient glucose intolerance  weeks post-exposure. Our results show that a single exposure to dioxin can suppress basal insulin levels long-term in both sexes, but effects on glucose homeostasis are sex-dependent.",2020-01-29,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57973-0,,,10,1,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004317791,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57973-0,journal-article,3004317791

However, how the brains of these subterranean mammals handle acute in vivo hypoxia is poorly understood. This study is the first to examine the molecular response to low oxygen in six different species of hypoxia-tolerant mole-rats from sub-Saharan Africa. Protein carbonylation, a known marker of DNA damage (hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine), and antioxidant capacity did not change following hypoxia but HIF-1 protein levels increased significantly in the brains of two species. Nearly 30 miRNAs known to play roles in hypoxia-tolerance were differentially regulated in a species-specific manner. The miRNAs exhibiting the strongest response to low oxygen stress inhibit apoptosis and regulate neuroinflammation, likely providing neuroprotection. A principal component analysis using a subset of the molecular targets assessed herein revealed differences between control and hypoxic groups for two solitary species (Georychus capensis and Bathyergus suillus), which are ecologically adapted to a normoxic environment, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to hypoxia relative to species that may experience hypoxia more regularly in nature. By contrast, all molecular data were included in the PCA to detect a difference between control and hypoxic populations of eusocial Heterocephalus glaber, indicating they may require many lower-fold changes in signaling pathways to adapt to low oxygen settings. Finally, none of the Cryptomys hottentotus subspecies showed a statistical difference between control and hypoxic groups, presumably due to hypoxia-tolerance derived from environmental pressures associated with a subterranean and social lifestyle.",2020-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,https://openalex.org/V20257348,The Company of Biologists,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.215905,,,,,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004518733,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.215905,journal-article,3004518733

One of them, called the direct approach, starts by solving a large-scale game and next derives a set of limiting equations as the population size tends to infinity. The second route is to apply mean field approximations and formalize a fixed point problem by analyzing the best response of a representative player. This paper addresses the connection and difference of the two approaches in a linear quadratic (LQ) setting. We first introduce an asymptotic solvability notion for the direct approach, which means for all sufficiently large population sizes, the corresponding game has a set of feedback Nash strategies in addition to a mild regularity requirement. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic solvability and show that in this case the solution converges to a mean field limit. This is accomplished by developing a re-scaling method to derive a low-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, where a non-symmetric Riccati ODE has a central role. We next compare with the fixed point approach which determines a two-point boundary value (TPBV) problem, and show that asymptotic solvability implies feasibility of the fixed point approach, but the converse is not true. We further address non-uniqueness in the fixed point approach and examine the long time behavior of the non-symmetric Riccati ODE in the asymptotic solvability problem.",2020-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,https://openalex.org/V184954342,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tac.2019.2919111,1397,1412,65,4,1,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2950816672,https://doi.org/10.1109/tac.2019.2919111,journal-article,2950816672

In the literature, the main focus has been on graphs that are static; that is, the topology is either invariant in time or subject to localized changes. The few studies on exploration of dynamic graphs have been almost all limited to the centralized case (i.e., assuming complete a priori knowledge of the changes and the times of their occurrence). We investigate the decentralized exploration of dynamic graphs (i.e., when the agents are unaware of the location and timing of the changes) focusing, in this paper, on dynamic systems whose underlying graph is a ring. We first consider the fully-synchronous systems traditionally assumed in the literature; i.e., all agents are active at each time step. We then introduce the notion of semi-synchronous systems, where only a subset of agents might be active at each time step (the choice of the subset is made by an adversary); this model is common in the context of mobile agents in continuous spaces but has never been studied before for agents moving in graphs. Our main focus is on the impact that the level of synchrony as well as other factors such as anonymity, knowledge of the size of the ring, and chirality (i.e., common orientation) have on the solvability of the problem, focusing on the minimum number of agents necessary. We draw an extensive map of feasibility, and of complexity in terms of minimum number of agent movements.

Heave and subsidence of the ground surface can offer insight into processes of heat and mass transfer in freezing and thawing soils. Additionally, subsidence is an important metric for monitoring and understanding the transformation of permafrost landscapes under climate change. Corresponding ground observations, however, are sparse and episodic. A simple tilt-arm apparatus with logging inclinometer has been developed to measure heave and subsidence of the ground surface with hourly resolution and millimeter accuracy. This contribution reports data from the first two winters and the first full summer, measured at three sites with contrasting organic and frost-susceptible soils in warm permafrost. The patterns of surface movement differ significantly between sites and from a prediction based on the Stefan equation and observed ground temperature. The data are rich in features of heave and subsidence that are several days to several weeks long and that may help elucidate processes in the ground. For example, late-winter heave followed by thawing and subsidence, as reported in earlier literature and hypothesized to be caused by infiltration and refreezing of water into permeable frozen ground, has been detected. An early-winter peak in heave, followed by brief subsidence, is discernible in a previous publication but so far has not been interpreted. An effect of precipitation on changes in surface elevation can be inferred with confidence. These results highlight the potential of ground-based observation of subsidence and heave as an enabler of progress in process understanding, modeling and interpretation of remotely sensed data.",2020-04-30,The Cryosphere,https://openalex.org/V169796457,,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1437-2020,1437,1447,14,4,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2979168910,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1437-2020,journal-article,2979168910

Nevertheless, they do not consider different users’ conditions, only using a single consensus protocol as the best fit one, as well as the IoT system is heavily constrained by computing and networking resources. In this article, we study a permissioned blockchain-based IoT architecture. In order to improve the scalability of the blockchain system and meet the needs of different users, we propose a service-oriented permissioned blockchain, where different consensus protocols are launched according to users’ quality of service (QoS) requirements. Specially, we quantify a few popular consensus protocols. Additionally, we select block producers, which need a great number of computation resources, as well as dynamically allocate network bandwidth to the blockchain system.

Discrete viewpoint techniques rely on reducing optic flow via inconsistent displacement, to reduce cybersickness when using stationary HMD-based VR systems. However, reports of their effectiveness are mostly anecdotal. We experimentally evaluate two discrete movement techniques; we refer to as rotation snapping and translation snapping. We conducted two experiments measuring participant cybersickness levels via the widely used simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ), as well as user-reported levels of nausea, presence, and objective error rates. Our results indicate that both rotation snapping and translation snapping significantly reduced SSQ by 40% for rotational viewpoint movement, and 50% for translational viewpoint movement.

Specifically, we examine whether novelty–variety is distinct from other needs in Basic Psychological Need Theory (BPNT) proposed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), whether its absence results in adverse effects and its satisfaction uniquely predicts well-being outcomes, and whether the effects are different across age and personality. In Study 1, participants (N = 202) rated novelty–variety and needs from BPNT (competence, autonomy, relatedness) in three domains to assess its independence from these needs and the extent to which novelty–variety uniquely relates to domain-specific well-being. In Study 2 (N = 414), the fulfillment of novelty–variety and two BPNT needs (autonomy and relatedness) was experimentally manipulated in work-related vignettes, further showing that unsatisfied novelty–variety is related to lower well-being.

This article contributes to understandings of the strategies of landlords to incorporate the “demoviction” as a technique of financialized gentrification and displacement. Examining the mass evictions, demolitions, and redevelopment within the Herongate neighbourhood in Ottawa, Canada, I conceptualize the demoviction as an investment strategy of intensification deployed by financialized landlords. I theorize the demoviction as a neoliberal technology of creative destruction involving the sociospatial reconfiguration – that is the social re-engineering and spatial restructuring – of a racialized and working-class community. Yet Herongate residents have not been passive subjects and have organized resistance efforts against the demoviction technique, challenging the notion that financialization is inevitable or uncontested. While scholarship has investigated opposition to financialization, this article further examines tactics of legal repression deployed by landlords responding to tenant resistance, providing insight into how corporate entities respond to and mobilize against social movements.

In the highly invaded Great Lakes, the climate is expected to become warmer with more extreme weather and variable precipitation, resulting in shorter iced-over periods and variable tributary flows as well as changes to pH and river hydrology and hydrogeomorphology. We review how climate change influences physiology, behavior, and demography of a damaging invasive species, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in the Great Lakes, and the consequences for sea lamprey control efforts. Sea lamprey control relies on surveys to monitor abundance of larval sea lamprey in Great Lakes tributaries. The abundance of parasitic, juvenile sea lampreys in the lakes is calculated by surveying wounding rates on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and trap surveys are used to enumerate adult spawning runs. Chemical control using lampricides (i.e., lamprey pesticides) to target larval sea lamprey and barriers to prevent adult lamprey from reaching spawning grounds are the most important tools used for sea lamprey population control. We describe how climate change could affect larval survival in rivers, growth and maturation in lakes, phenology and the spawning migration as adults return to rivers, and the overall abundance and distribution of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Our review suggests that Great Lakes sea lamprey may benefit from climate change with longer growing seasons, more rapid growth, and greater access to spawning habitat, but uncertainties remain about the future availability and suitability of larval habitats.

We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers. Methods To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases, 2 organizational websites, one search engine, and 29 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources. We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient coverage for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps. Review findings A total of 136 studies from 119 articles were included in the systematic map database and used to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial trend design i.e., lacking a ‘true’ before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro), and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diversion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival, performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs). Conclusions This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of flow regime other than magnitude (e.g., flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all interventions) affect population viability.",2020-12-01,Environmental Evidence,https://openalex.org/V2737036037,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z,,,,,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024059517,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z,journal-article,3024059517

First, meaning-related literacy activities are those where print is present but is not the focus of the parent-child interaction, for example, when parents read storybooks to their children. In contrast, code-related literacy activities focus on the print, for example, activities such as when parents teach their children the names and sounds of letters or to read words. The present study was conducted to expand the Home Literacy Model by examining its relation with children's engagement in literacy activities at home and at school as Finnish children transitioned from kindergarten to Grades 1 and 2. Two facets of children's engagement were examined, namely, children's independent reading at home and their interest in literacy activities. Children (N = 378) were tested and interviewed at the ends of kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. Mothers completed questionnaires on their home literacy activities at each test time, and they reported the frequency with which their children read independently twice when children were in grade school. Tested was a longitudinal model of the hypothesized relations among maternal home literacy activities (shared reading and teaching of reading), children's reading skills, independent reading, and their interest in literacy activities/tasks as children progressed from kindergarten to Grade 2. Stringent path analyses that included all auto-regressors were conducted. Findings extended previous research in four ways. First, the frequency of shared reading and teaching of reading at home predicted the frequency of children's independent reading 1 year later. Second, children with stronger early literacy skills in kindergarten read independently more frequently once they were in Grade 1. Third, parents adapted, from kindergarten to Grade 1, their teaching behaviors to their children's progress in reading, whereas shared reading decreased over time. Fourth, children's own reports of interest in literacy activities were mostly not linked to other variables. Taken together, these results add another layer to the Home Literacy Model.",2020-07-02,Frontiers in Psychology,https://openalex.org/V9692511,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01508,,,11,,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039185217,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01508,journal-article,3039185217

Cognitive radio (CR), on the other hand, can utilize the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and allow a secondary user (SU) to share the same spectrum with the primary user (PU) as long as the SU does not impose interference on the PU. Owing to the potential of these emerging technologies, to provide full spectrum efficiency, this paper focuses on the mixed CR RF-FSO transmission scheme, where RF communication is employed at one hop followed by the FSO transmission on the other hop in a dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) configuration. To quantify the performance of the proposed scheme, closed form error probability is derived over Rayleigh/Exponentiated Weibull (EW) fading distributions by considering the statistical and instantaneous feedback channel of the primary network.

The batholith was emplaced following the accretion of the Gander and Avalon zones of the northern Appalachians during the Neoacadian Orogeny. The Mount Douglas Granite is divided into three units, Dmd1, Dmd2, and Dmd3, that formed by progressive high degrees of fractional crystallization. The two most fractionated units, i.e., Dmd and Dmd3, are locally associated with greisen/sheeted veins-related endogranitic Sn-W-Mo mineralization. Whole-rock δ18O values of +6.0 to +7.3‰, high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7055 to 0.71665, slightly positive eNd(368 Ma) values (+0.3 to +1.1), and Pb isotopic data indicate that the granite was derived dominantly from partial melting of juvenile Avalonian crust, contaminated by supracrustal rocks. Petrochemical features support the idea of multiple periods of fractional crystallization at lower temperatures producing compositionally more evolved magmas. This is supported by estimated zircon saturation temperatures that decrease from Dmd1 (747–826 °C) → Dmd2 (733–817 °C) → Dmd3 (729–816 °C). The estimated crystallization pressure based on normative quartz and feldspar (albite + orthoclase) contents also decreases with increasing silica content, from 2.3 kbar (~7.7 km) in Dmd1 to 0. kbar (~1 km) in Dmd3. Whole-rock geochemical characteristics of this system show that unit Dmd3 is the most highly evolved unit; it has the highest SiO2 (avg. 76.4 wt.%.), LILE contents (e.g., Li, Rb, Cs), Rb/Sr (mean = 42), certain HFSE (Ta, Th, U) including Y (≤138 ppm), and REE, and has the most pronounced negative Eu anomalies (avg. Eu/Eu* = 0.08) and the lowest K/Rb (70–127), Nb/Ta (mean = 4.9), and Zr/Hf (mean = 23.5). Therefore, unit Dmd3 with the highest content of incompatible elements is the most prospective for Sn, W, Zn, Bi, and U mineralization, and then Dmd2.",2020-02-01,Ore Geology Reviews,https://openalex.org/V29724373,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2019.103266,103266,103266,117,,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994738959,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2019.103266,journal-article,2994738959

Each must state, very clearly, how the mercury being used at artisanal and small-scale gold mines will be phased out. In most areas of sub-Saharan Africa, however, devising a comprehensive NAP promises to be an enormous and indeed, challenging, undertaking. Here, the institutional capacity and resources, expertise and at times, commitment needed to capture the level of detail the Minamata Secretariat expects to be included in each NAP are woefully lacking. One of the more challenging tasks ahead, given the shortage of hard data available on the sector’s populations, production and activities, promises to be the design and implementation of appropriate educational, communication and support-related strategies for the ‘vulnerable populations’ who rely on work at artisanal and small-scale gold mines for their incomes. This is especially significant for women, who, despite accounting for at least 50 percent of the region’s artisanal and small-gold mine workforce, mostly carry out the manual work at the lower tiers of the sector’s labour hierarchies. Taking stock of this largely ‘invisible’ work and the circumstances driving individuals to pursue employment in this sector in the first place, this paper reflects critically on the challenges with reducing women’s exposure to mercury at artisanal and small-scale gold mines in sub-Saharan Africa.

The study objective was to investigate the release of (IL)-1 family members from primary airway epithelial-cells during differentiation, and how they affect primary airway fibroblast (PAF)-induced inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and collagen I remodeling. The release of IL-1α/β and IL-3 during airway epithelial differentiation was assessed over 20-days using air-liquid interface cultures. The effect of IL- family cytokines on airway fibroblasts grown on collagen-coated well-plates and 3-dimensional collagen gels was assessed by measurement of inflammatory mediators and ECM proteins by ELISA and western blot, as well as collagen fiber formation using non-linear optical microscopy after 24-hours.

Our findings highlight the complex linkages between agricultural development, environmental degradation, and rural livelihoods. Despite the associated increased returns-to-scale in agricultural productivity and enhanced speed in land preparation with tractor-based mechanization, the clearing of major trees on farmlands as a precondition for obtaining ploughing services encourages land degradation, including the depletion of vital naturally growing tree species—shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) and dawadawa (Parkia biglobosa)—that have critical food provisioning, cultural, and socioeconomic value. The drive towards extensification has further produced competitive forces that fuel the appropriation of previously inalienable communal lands and weakening of longstanding norms that mediate environmental resource conservation and use. This situation is poised to alter customary land governance and the basis on which women assert their rights to land-based resources including shea and dawadawa. Marginalized women are progressively shifting their livelihood strategies into environmentally unsustainable subsistence activities. This study demonstrates the adverse ecological, socioeconomic, and political impacts of agricultural mechanization when implemented in agrarian societies marked by widespread poverty and pervasive gender inequities. Given the growing centrality of tractors and trees to rural livelihoods, we recommend conservation agriculture for the simultaneous promotion of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.

This concept has been challenged by alternative hypotheses involving out-of-sequence emplacement of some of its major layers as sills. Both scenarios have partial support from high-precision U-Pb geochronological data. To test these contradictory hypotheses, new zircon geothermometric data and compositional data for plagioclase from the Upper Critical Zone are presented and the available geochronological data are tested against the predictions of the thermal evolution of the entire RLS for both emplacement and cooling scenarios. Crystallization temperatures of zircon within units of the Upper Critical Zone were estimated using Ti-in-zircon thermometry and range between 79 ± 4  °C and 86 ± 6  °C. The data are used in conjunction with a detailed numerical model of heat flow in the Bushveld Complex that is used to approximate the duration and extent of thermal perturbations felt throughout the system and delimit the time intervals during which zircon crystals could have grown at the measured crystallization temperatures. The results show that prolonged cooling histories (>1 Myr), that would be experienced near the centre of a large, slowly cooled, plutonic magma chamber, would erase signs of plagioclase zoning at  kbar and moderate f H  O ; however, plagioclase crystals with zoning profiles spanning at least 1 mole% An are common in the Upper Critical Zone. In contrast, emplacement of the major units of the RLS at widely separated intervals, as recorded by the existing high-precision U-Pb dataset, would impose transient thermal effects on the system against a backdrop of generally much lower ambient temperatures throughout its evolution. In this scenario, apparent ages of zircon crystals would record the time of cooling through temperatures near the water-saturated biotite granite solidus, corresponding to the final intercumulus mineral assemblage in both mafic and ultramafic macrolayers. Subsequent reheating of these rocks would be unable to reset primary zircon crystallization dates but might, in some examples, result in some amount of remelting or regrowth of zircon. Comparison of the evolving temperature fields of the two types of emplacement and cooling histories shows that the existing geochronological data and preservation of plagioclase zoning are consistent with out-of-sequence emplacement and rapid cooling of individual ultramafic sills into previously solidified lithologies of the RLS but not with the conventional view of a single monolithic magma body.",2020-03-15,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,https://openalex.org/V119230507,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116084,116084,116084,534,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000905830,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116084,journal-article,3000905830

Positive effects of embodiment emerged regardless of whether transgressions were committed by a collective (Studies 1, 2, and 6) or an individual (Studies 3-5), and were equally strong regardless of whether or not the transgressor issued an apology (Studies  and 5). Furthermore, embodied remorse appeared to lie beyond suspicion: if anything, those low in dispositional trust were more positively influenced by embodied remorse than those high in dispositional trust. Despite all these positive effects, embodied remorse did not have a significant effect on forgiveness in any of the studies, and an internal meta-analysis revealed a significant effect that was of negligible size.

Although advancement in medicine has allowed humans to live longer, the prevalence of age-associated medical complications is continuously burdening older adults worldwide. Current animal models used in research to study aging have provided novel information that has helped investigators understand the aging process; however, these models are limiting. Aging is a complex process that is regulated at multiple biological levels, and while a single manipulation in these models can provide information on a process, it is not enough to understand the global regulation of aging. Some mammalian hibernators live up to 9.8-times higher than their expected average lifespan, and new research attributes this increase to their ability to hibernate. A common theme amongst these mammalian hibernators is their ability to greatly reduce their metabolic rate to a fraction of their normal rate and initiate cytoprotective responses that enable their survival. Metabolic rate depression is strictly regulated at different biological levels in order to enable the animal to not only survive, but to also do so by relying mainly on their limited internal fuels. As such, understanding both the global and specific regulatory mechanisms used to promote survival during hibernation could, in theory, allow investigators to have a better understanding of the aging process. This can also allow pharmaceutical industries to find therapeutics that could delay or reverse age-associated medical complications and promote healthy aging and longevity in humans.",2020-02-27,Experimental Gerontology,https://openalex.org/V122591147,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2020.110889,110889,110889,134,,0,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007156744,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2020.110889,journal-article,3007156744

This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based warning algorithm for rear-end collision avoidance. Three key issues are addressed by applying the neural network approach, including noises in positioning, inaccurate risk assessment, and enhanced comfort level of passengers. First, to filter the noises in positioning, wireless vehicular communications are leveraged; accurate relative lane positioning can be achieved to justify when two vehicles are in the same lane. Second, an online neural network model is developed to assess the risk of collisions in real time while driving. The algorithm can converge fast to a globally optimal solution and adapt to different traffic environments. Third, to maximize the comfort of passengers during the braking process, a graded warning strategy is developed at the prerequisite of guaranteed safety. With the above schemes sewed in to one framework, our proposal can achieve rear-end warning with reduced missing alarm rate, accurate risk assessment and enhanced comfort to passengers. The extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposal in terms of relative lane positioning, risk assessment, and collision avoidance.",2020-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,https://openalex.org/V144771191,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2897687,565,579,21,2,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2915686220,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2019.2897687,journal-article,2915686220

Natural freeze tolerance involves not just de novo preservation mechanisms such as synthesis of high levels of cryoprotectants or novel proteins that manage ice formation, but also requires attention to and co-ordination of many cellular processes. The present review examines recent studies of the freeze-tolerant wood frog (Rana sylvatica) that probed previously unexplored areas of metabolic adaptation for freezing survival, with a particular emphasis on mitochondria. Post-translational controls on enzyme function play a prominent role in resculpting metabolic responses of the wood frog to freezing including reversible phosphorylation control over fuel processing at the pyruvate dehydrogenase locus and modulation of antioxidant defense enzymes (Mn-SOD, catalase). Enzymes involved in mitochondrial nitrogen metabolism (glutamate dehydrogenase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase) are also differentially regulated during freezing but by different post-translational modifications including ADP-ribosylation, lysine acetylation or glutarylation. The action of microRNAs in mediating post-translational controls on gene expression aid the suppression of energy-expensive (cell cycle) or destructive (apoptosis) processes in the frozen state while also providing storage of transcripts that will be immediately available for repair or reactivation of metabolic processes after thawing.

Importantly, vertebrate hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs), have been reported to increase, decrease or show no alterations stemming from infections, challenging the generality of parasite-associated GC responses and motivating a search for important moderator variables. We undertook the first meta-analysis of changes in vertebrate GCs following experimental infection with parasites, extracting 14 effect sizes from 4 studies involving 32 host and 32 parasite species to test for general patterns of GC following infection, as well as the influence of moderators. Overall, infection increased GCs relative to preliminary or control levels when the single largest effect sizes from repeated measures studies were examined, suggesting that parasites of vertebrate hosts can be thought of generally as physiological stressors by elevating GCs. When all effect sizes were included along with the moderator of sampling time post-infection (tPI), parasite infection still had a positive effect on host GCs. However, the strength of that effect did not relate consistently to tPI, illustrating temporal differences in GC changes during the course of infection among parasite taxa (e.g. arthropod vs. bacterial infections). Other moderator variables examined did not influence GC responses.

Our proposed Bayesian estimator is design consistent for general sampling designs and the Bayesian credible intervals are calibrated in the sense of having asymptotically valid design‐based frequentist properties under single‐stage unequal probability sampling designs with small sampling fractions. Large sample properties of the Bayesian inference proposed are established for both non‐informative and informative priors under the design‐based framework. We also propose a Bayesian model selection procedure with complex survey data and show that it works for general sampling designs. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is described for the required computation of the posterior distribution for general vector parameters.

To date, current therapeutic approaches focus on managing motor symptoms and trying to slow neurodegeneration, with minimal capacity to promote neurorecovery. mGluR5 plays a key role in neuroplasticity, and altered mGluR5 signaling contributes to synucleinopathy and dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested whether the mGluR5-negative allosteric modulator, (2-chloro-4-[2[2,5-dimethyl-1-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl] imidazol-4-yl] ethynyl] pyridine (CTEP), would be effective in improving motor deficits and promoting neural recovery in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model. Lesions were induced by 6-ODHA striatal infusion, and 3 days later treatment with CTEP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle commenced for either  or 1 weeks. Animals were subjected to behavioral, pathological, and molecular analyses. We also assessed how long the effects of CTEP persisted, and finally, using rapamycin, determined the role of the mTOR pathway. CTEP treatment induced a duration-dependent improvement in apomorphine-induced rotation and performance on rotarod in lesioned mice. Moreover, CTEP promoted a recovery of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers and normalized FosB levels in lesioned mice. The beneficial effects of CTEP were paralleled by an activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the striatum of lesioned mice. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (sirolimus), abolished CTEP-induced neurorecovery and rescue of motor deficits. Our findings indicate that mTOR pathway is a useful target to promote recovery and that mGluR5 allosteric regulators may potentially be repurposed to selectively target this pathway to enhance neuroplasticity in patients with Parkinson's disease.",2020-03-01,Molecular Neurobiology,https://openalex.org/V194681035,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-019-01818-z,1418,1431,57,3,0,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989725949,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-019-01818-z,journal-article,2989725949

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids (wild and captive) which continues to spread geographically resulting in exposure to potential new host species. The disease agent (PrPCWD) is a misfolded conformer of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). In Canada, the disease is endemic in Alberta and Saskatchewan, affecting mule and white-tail deer, with lesser impact on elk and moose. As the disease continues to expand, additional wild ungulate species including bison, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, and pronghorn antelope may be exposed. To better understand the species-barrier, we reviewed the current literature on taxa naturally or experimentally exposed to CWD to identify susceptible and resistant species. We created a phylogeny of these taxa using cytochrome B and found that CWD susceptibility followed the species phylogeny. Using this phylogeny we estimated the probability of CWD susceptibility for wild ungulate species. We then compared PrPC amino acid polymorphisms among these species to identify which sites segregated between susceptible and resistant species. We identified sites that were significantly associated with susceptibility, but they were not fully discriminating. Finally, we sequenced Prnp from 578 wild ungulates to further evaluate their potential susceptibility. Together, these data suggest the host-range for CWD will potentially include pronghorn, mountain goat and bighorn sheep, but bison are likely to be more resistant. These findings highlight the need for monitoring potentially susceptible species as CWD continues to expand.",2020-02-03,Prion,https://openalex.org/V4594078,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/19336896.2020.1720486,56,66,14,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004909499,https://doi.org/10.1080/19336896.2020.1720486,journal-article,3004909499

I introduce the term ‘dis/connection’ into the existing repertoire to illustrate how the interplay between connection and disconnection serves as a tactic and a technique of both repression and resistance. ‘Dis/connection as repression’ represents a political practice of modern power that is ubiquitous, diffuse and circulating; it captures both territorial and network ecologies, renders the living condition of the targeted community transparent, making them visible to the gaze of the authorities. Against this practice, I identify the possibility of resistance by conceptualising ‘dis/connection as resistance’ in the form of an assemblage, namely the interplay between connection and disconnection that is formed through a constellation of things, each paving their own pathways but can cohere at certain events or moments before dispersing again. ‘Dis/connection assemblage’ follows the logic of media hybridity, is built upon temporary aggregates of media artefacts and connects networks and territorialities in multiple spatialities and temporalities.

Their relatively small sample sizes, long growth periods, and difficulties distinguishing the sexes of fossil specimens mean that there are little compelling data on dimorphism in these animals. The extant gharial ( Gavialis gangeticus ) is a large and endangered crocodylian that is sexually dimorphic in size, but males also possesses a sexually selected structure, the ghara, which has an osteological correlate in the presence of a fossa associated with the nares. This makes the species a unique model for potentially assessing dimorphism in fossil lineages, such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs, because it is a large, slow-growing, egg-laying archosaur. Here we assess the dimorphism of G. gangeticus across 106 specimens and show that the presence of a narial fossa diagnoses adult male gharials. Males are larger than females, but the level of size dimorphism, and that of other cranial features, is low and difficult to detect without a priori knowledge of the sexes, even with this large dataset.

These compounds are traditionally measured in matrices like liver and plasma, however social and environmental pressures warrant the development of non-lethal and non-invasive methods to assess animal health. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method to separate and detect F2-isoPs in fish mucus. The method was developed and validated for four native F2-isoP isomers using Northern pike mucus (Esox lucius). Linearity was observed between  and 100 pg/μL. The limits of detection of the four F2-IsoP isomers ranged from 0.63 to 2.0 ng/g. Recoveries ranged from 7 to 95%, and matrix effects were small (<10%). The between-day and within-day repeatability for all target analytes was lower than 20% RSD. Endogenous F2-isoPs were measured in the pike mucus (5.3-28.8 ng/g). A preliminary study of baseline F2-isoP concentrations in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) captured from five lakes at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, was also conducted to test the interspecies applicability of the method. Endogenous F2-isoPs were quantified in lake trout (6.3-132 ng/g).

The processor can be reconfigured into either multi-cycle execution mode (low computational speed with low dynamic power consumption) or pipeline execution mode (high computational speed at the expense of high dynamic power), based on dynamic workload characteristics in IoT applications. Switching between modes is accomplished by exploiting the partial reconfiguration (PR) feature offered by the recent advancements in modern FPGAs. A RISC processor was designed based on the proposed micro-architectural level technique and implemented on FPGA as IoT sensor node.

They can reduce their metabolic rate (>85%) under severe hypoxia, remain moderately active and recover with no obvious signs of damage. Hence, NMRs are an excellent model for studying mammalian hypoxia tolerance. The current study characterized the involvement of posttranslational modifications in regulating the Akt/mTOR pathway that regulates protein synthesis, and the responses of key ribosomal proteins in order to assess tissue-specific responses to 4 h exposure to 7% O2 (compared to controls at 21% O2). Results showed a tissue-specific regulation of the Akt/mTOR pathway via differential phosphorylation. Relative amounts of p-TSC(S939) in brain and of p-TSC(S939), p-Akt(473) and p-PTEN(S380) in liver increased under hypoxia, whereas levels of IGF1R(Y1135/1136) in liver decreased. In skeletal muscle, levels of p-Akt(S473) and p-PTEN(S380) decreased during hypoxia, whereas lungs showed an increase in p-mTOR(S2884) content but a decrease in p-RPS6(S235–236) under the same conditions. Analysis of the phosphorylation states of ribosomal proteins revealed increases in p-4E-BP1(T37/46) content in brain and lungs under hypoxia, as well as a rise in total 4E-BP1 protein level in liver. Phosphorylated eIF-4B(S422) content also increased in liver while levels of p-eIF-2α(S51), and eIF-4E(S209) decreased during hypoxia in liver. Overall, hypoxia altered the Akt/mTOR pathway, which correlated with a general decrease in activity of the ribosomal protein biosynthesis machinery in muscle, lung, and brain of NMRs.

Given recent stringencies in effluent regulations, industries are required to treat their wastewater on-site. There is a critical need for compact, high-rate, cost-effective wastewater technologies to treat industrial wastewaters, such as the sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential and evaluate the performance of the sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor cycling between anaerobic and aerobic stages to treat high-strength food and beverage wastewaters. Specifically, this study focuses on the effects of anaerobic staging times and enhanced aeration on the removal of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous from cheese production wastewaters. Increasing anaerobic staging times was found to improve the removal rates of carbon beyond previously reported moving bed biofilm reactor results. Increasing the anaerobic stage however decreased the total nitrogen removal, with organic nitrogen undergoing ammonification during the anaerobic stage. This study demonstrates an optimum anaerobic staging time of 13 min; with a carbon removal rate of 31.1 g-sCOD·m-2d-1 and a nitrogen removal rate of 1.3 g-N·m-2d-1. Enhanced aeration was found to be detrimental to phosphorous removal, where a moderate aeration rate demonstrated a net total phosphorous removal of approximately 2 mg-P·l-1 with the phosphorous-content of the suspended solids being approximately 4%. Finally, the sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor shows potential for on-site treatment of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous from cheese production wastewater.",2020-08-01,Chemosphere,https://openalex.org/V203465130,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126407,126407,126407,252,,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009851422,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126407,journal-article,3009851422

The GM model adds isospin-triplet scalars to the Standard Model in a way that preserves custodial symmetry at tree level; however, this custodial symmetry has long been known to be violated at the one-loop level by hypercharge interactions. We consider the custodial-symmetric GM model to arise at some high scale as a result of an unspecified ultraviolet completion, and quantify the custodial symmetry violation induced as the model is run down to the weak scale. The measured value of the eletroweak rho parameter (along with unitarity considerations) lets us constrain the scale of the ultraviolet completion to lie below tens to hundreds of TeV. Subject to this constraint, we quantify the size of other custodial-symmetry-violating effects at the weak scale, including custodial symmetry violation in the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to W and Z boson pairs and mixings and mass splittings among the additional Higgs bosons in the theory.

Mess enters the mixed methods process in two interrelated ways. The first is empirically, where quantitative and qualitative findings diverge or contrast rather than cohere; the second is through design, where research contexts demand unplanned adaptation. This article outlines three practices that help mixed methods researchers recognize and navigate both kinds of mess, collectively called the “craft attitude.” The craft attitude consists of comfort with uncertainty, a nonlinear/recursive approach to research, and understanding research as storytelling. I further argue these components can orient researchers to mess in both structured and flexible ways by fostering three intellectual activities: science, craft/art, and ethical value judgment.

Biomechanical properties of brain tissue such as anisotropy and viscoelasticity are incorporated into the model, which provides more accurate and realistic imitation of the deformation of brain tissue. A descent method with GPU-based implementation is used to solve the optimization problem, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of computational efficiency. Simulation results show that both the anisotropic and viscoelastic behaviors are presented in the deformation model. The GPU-based implementation of the proposed model significantly improves the computational efficiency over CPU-based FEM models with the implicit integration scheme. Moreover, the result of the proposed model converges to the exact solution of implicit Euler integration after 96 iterations.

In the current paper, we seek to contextualize this enigma by focusing on the interpersonal dynamics of psychopathic individuals in romantic encounters. We first formulate a plausible evolutionary function, the sexual exploitation hypothesis, that proposes psychopathy exhibits “special design” features for subverting female mate choice, facilitating the induction of favorable impressions and desire in prospective intimate relationships. We then test the hypothesis in two studies with university samples. Study  had young men assessed on psychopathy, social intelligence, and sociosexuality engage in a filmed dating interaction. Study  had young women view a subsample of the videos, rate them on desirability, and leave voice messages. Results show psychopathy was related to sociosexuality, specific factors of social intelligence, and generating higher desirability ratings from women after controlling for men’s physical attractiveness. Analyses involving comparisons of two men showed women’s ratings increased in favor of the more psychopathic man. Women’s voice pitch also changed, but only in response to different facets of psychopathy. The results provide preliminary support for the sexual exploitation hypothesis and suggest that more dynamic assessment of putative desirability in psychopathy may be required to capture its plausible special design features in prospective dating encounters.",2020-03-01,Evolutionary Psychological Science,https://openalex.org/V2764424815,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-019-00213-0,64,81,6,1,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970304946,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-019-00213-0,journal-article,2970304946

Fully automated localization of peripheral zone (PZ) PCa using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map might be clinically useful. Purpose/Hypothesis To describe automated localization of PCa in the PZ on ADC map MR images using an ensemble U-Net-based model. Study Type Retrospective, case–control. Population In all, 22 patients (154 and 7 patients with and without clinically significant PZ PCa, respectively), training, and testing was performed using dataset images of 14 and 80 patients, respectively. Field Strength 3T, ADC maps. Sequence ADC map. Assessment The ground truth was established by manual delineation of the prostate and prostate PZ tumors on ADC maps by dedicated radiologists using MRI-radical prostatectomy maps as a reference standard. Statistical Tests: Performance of the ensemble model was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, and specificity metrics on a per-slice basis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were employed as well. The paired t-test was used to test the differences between the performances of constituent networks of the ensemble model.

There has been limited effort to estimate transit times in southern boreal Precambrian Shield landscapes, which are characteristically heterogeneous with surface cover including till, thin soils, bedrock outcrops, and depressional wetland features that play contrasting hydrologic roles. This study presents approximately 3.5 years of precipitation and streamflow water isotope data and estimates mean transit times (MTTs) and the young water fraction (py) across six small catchments in the Muskoka‐Haliburton region of south‐central Ontario. The main objectives were to define a typical range of MTTs for headwater catchments in this region and to identify landscape variables that best explain differences in MTTs/py using airborne light detection and ranging and digital terrain analysis. Of the transit time distributions, the two parallel linear reservoir and gamma distributions best describe the hydrology of these catchments, particularly because of their ability to capture more extreme changes related to events such as snowmelt. The estimated MTTs, regardless of the modelling approach or distribution used, are positively associated with the percent wetland area and negatively with mean slope in the catchments. In this landscape, low‐gradient features such as wetlands increase catchment scale water storage when antecedent conditions are dryer and decrease transit times when there is a moisture surplus, which plausibly explains the increases in MTTs and mean annual runoff from catchments with significant coverage of these landscape features.",2020-01-30,Hydrological Processes,https://openalex.org/V75830442,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13609,,,,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2981621583,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13609,journal-article,2981621583

However, such studies may not generalize to broader environmental settings. As such, we estimated the fitness of six AMR mutants of Escherichia coli in ten media reflecting ecological niches, human hosts, and standard lab conditions. We found extensive evidence for genotype × environment interactions, with different genotypes favored in different environments.

Using laboratory experiments, theoretical calculations, and X-ray synchrotron microtomography, this study documents the topology and considers controls on the extraction of two immiscible liquids during partial melting of mantle peridotite. Under hydrostatic conditions, the measured dihedral angle at silicate melt-mineral-mineral junctions is 13.7–21.3°. Silicate melt is distributed along grain edges forming incompletely interconnected melt channels that disconnected by some dead ends at melt fractions ∼7–9 vol%. Application of theoretically predicted permeability ( k ∼ 1 − 1 –10−16 m2) permits estimation of the extraction velocity of silicate melt of 0.7-11.1 μm/day within a single interconnected melt channel. In the absence of silicate melt, isolated sulfide droplets (3.77 vol%) show a sulfide-olivine-olivine dihedral angle of 91.5–101.3°. However, in the presence of silicate melt, sulfide droplets (average size ∼2.53 ± 2.14 μm, 1σ) are partially surrounded by silicate melt and stranded in triple junctions or melt pockets due to the limitation of the smallest dimension (0.3 μm) of melt channels. Thus, the extraction of sulfide liquid is highly restricted by these dead ends and the smallest dimension of melt channels during porous flow of silicate melt. In contrast, during large-strain shear deformation (strain ∼1.6–2.5), initially stranded sulfide droplets were elongated and extracted with silicate melt into liquid-rich sheets with a length of several hundred microns, constantly oriented at 14.3 ± 4.5° to the shear plane and antithetic to the shear direction. The angle is lower than that (18–30°) of those sheets containing sulfide liquid only, indicating that silicate melt dominates liquid-rich sheets. Driven by stress, silicate melt-dominated liquid-rich sheets open the appropriately oriented grain boundaries between silicate minerals, thus providing an efficient pathway for the extraction of sulfide liquid during deformation. When such sheet-like channels remain open, sulfide droplets (> millimeter-scale) can be potentially mobile through high strain domains of the upper mantle, contributing to the addition of chalcophile elements and the fertilization of the lithospheric mantle.",2020-04-15,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,https://openalex.org/V119230507,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116162,116162,116162,536,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007855330,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116162,journal-article,3007855330

In general, plovers and dowitchers had higher levels of most organochlorine pesticides, and renal cadmium (Cd) and selenium (Se) than the other species. Although we found seasonal differences, no clear patterns in contaminant concentrations among sampling locations were detected but the concentrations found at the breeding grounds were always the highest for chlorinated pesticides and mercury (Hg).

The age of the 325°-trending Uolevinlehto dyke is estimated at ca. 2400 ± 12 Ma from discordant multigrain baddeleyite fractions, showing it to be younger than ca. 2450 Ma dykes across Karelia. The 350°-trending Myllykangas dyke has a minimum age of 2135.2 + 3.6/−3.7 Ma based on chemically abraded zircon. Results from single baddeleyite grains provide a precise upper intercept age of 2128.9 ± 1.2 Ma for the 320°-trending Sipojuntti dyke. Our new U-Pb ages are integrated with those from the literature to define six major dyke swarms in the Pudasjarvi block: the NNE-trending ca. 2.45 Ga Paajarvi, NW-trending ca. 2.40 Ga Uolevinlehto, NW-trending ca. 2.13–2.10 Ga Tohmajarvi, WNW-trending ca. 2.07 Ga Palomaa, NNW-trending ca. 1.98 Ga Paukkajanvaara, and undated “East-West” dykes. Trends of contemporaneous dyke swarms in the Taivalkoski and Kuhmo blocks, however, are systematically offset by 35°. With subvertical dips, offset dyke swarms record 35° clockwise vertical-axis rotation of the Pudasjarvi block relative to the interior of Karelia, consistent with dextral transpression during the Svecofennian orogeny. Structural restoration of the Pudasjarvi block improves the constraints on regional dyke swarm patterns, and these are used to revise the position of the Karelia-Kola craton within the context of the paleogeographic reconstruction of supercraton Superia.",2020-09-01,Lithos,https://openalex.org/V107629180,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2020.105553,105553,105553,368-369,,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021273001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2020.105553,journal-article,3021273001

Involutions especially over $ \mathbb {F}_{q} $ with q is even have been used in many applications, including cryptography and coding theory. The explicit study of involutions (including their fixed points) has started with the paper (Charpin et al. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 62(4), 2266–2276 2016) for binary fields and since then a lot of attention had been made in this direction following it; see for example, Charpin et al. (2016), Coulter and Mesnager (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 64(4), 2979–2986, 2018), Fu and Feng (2017), Wang (Finite Fields Appl., 45, 422–427, 2017) and Zheng et al. (2019). In this paper, we study constructions of involutions over finite fields by proposing an involutory version of the AGW Criterion. We demonstrate our general construction method by considering polynomials of different forms. First, in the multiplicative case, we present some necessary conditions of f(x) = xrh(xs) over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ to be involutory on $\mathbb {F}_{q}$, where s∣(q − 1). Based on this, we provide three explicit classes of involutions of the form xrh(xq− 1) over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{2}}$. Recently, Zheng et al. (Finite Fields Appl., 56, 1–16 2019) found an equivalent relationship between permutation polynomials of $g(x)^{q^{i}} - g(x) + cx +(1-c)\delta $ and $g\left (x^{q^{i}} - x + \delta \right ) +c x$. The other part work of this paper is to consider the involutory property of these two classes of permutation polynomials, which fall into the additive case of the AGW criterion. On one hand, we reveal the relationship of being involutory between the form $ g(x)^{q^{i}} - g(x) + cx +(1-c)\delta $ and the form $ g\left (x^{q^{i}} - x + \delta \right ) +c x $ over $ \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}} $ ; on the other hand, the compositional inverses of permutation polynomials of the form $ g\left (x^{q^{i}} - x + \delta \right ) + cx $ over $ \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}} $ are computed, where $ \delta \in \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}} $, $ g(x) \in \mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}[x] $ and integers m, i satisfy 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1. In addition, a class of involutions of the form $ g\left (x^{q^{i}} - x + \delta \right ) + cx $ is constructed. Finally, we study the fixed points of constructed involutions and compute the number of all involutions with any given number of fixed points over $ \mathbb {F}_{q} $.",2020-03-01,Cryptography and Communications,https://openalex.org/V129219326,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12095-019-00386-2,165,185,12,2,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2902893142,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12095-019-00386-2,journal-article,2902893142

However, the relative costs of conserving various taxonomic groups and the potential of these costs to interact with existing biases have been much less explored. We analyzed conservation programs across more than 2,000 species in 3 countries to investigate the costs of conserving species within taxonomic groups and how these costs might affect conservation planning. For each data set, we tested for differences in mean annual cost among taxonomic groups. For the data set from the United States, recovery plans differed in duration, so we also tested for differences in total costs among taxonomic groups. Although the costs for individual species varied widely, there were strong international consistencies. For example, mammals cost 8-26 times more on average to conserve than plants and 13-19 times more to conserve than aquatic invertebrates. On average, bird species cost 5-30 times more to conserve than plants and 6-14 times more to conserve than aquatic invertebrates. These cost differences could exacerbate unequal resource allocation among taxonomic groups such that more charismatic groups both receive more attention and require more resources, leading to neglect of other taxonomic groups.Costos Relativos de la Conservación de Especies Amenazadas entre Grupos Taxonómicos Resumen El sesgo hacia la protección legal y la priorización de grupos taxonómicos carismáticos, como los mamíferos y las aves, y el sesgo que no favorece a otros grupos, como los insectos y las plantas, está bien documentado. A pesar de esto, los costos relativos de la conservación de varios grupos taxonómicos y el potencial que tienen estos costos para interactuar con los sesgos existentes no han sido explorados a profundidad. Analizamos los programas de conservación para más de 2,000 especies en tres países y así investigar los costos de la conservación de especies limitada a los grupos taxonómicos y cómo estos costos podrían afectar a la planeación de la conservación. Buscamos diferencias en el costo medio anual entre los grupos taxonómicos en cada conjunto de datos. Para el conjunto de datos de los Estados Unidos, los planes de recuperación difirieron en su duración, por lo que también buscamos diferencias en los costos totales entre los grupos taxonómicos. Aunque los costos para cada especie individual variaron ampliamente, hubo consistencias internacionales sólidas. Por ejemplo, la conservación de los mamíferos cuesta en promedio de 8-26 veces más que la de las plantas y de 13-19 veces más que la de los invertebrados acuáticos. En promedio, cuesta de 5-30 veces más la conservación de especies de aves que la de las plantas y de 6-14 veces más que la de los invertebrados acuáticos. Estas diferencias en los costos podrían agravar la asignación desigual de recursos entre los grupos taxonómicos de tal manera que los grupos taxonómicos más carismáticos reciben más atención y requieren de más recursos, resultando en el descuido de otros grupos taxonómicos.既有报道表明, 那些更受人们喜爱的类群如哺乳动物和鸟类, 获得的立法保护和保护优先等级均优于其它类群如昆虫和植物。然而, 保护各类群的相对成本以及保护成本与保护偏好性可能的相互作用尚不清楚。我们分析了 3 个国家 200 余个物种的保护项目, 以研究各个类群中物种的保护成本及其对保护规划的影响。我们检验了每个数据集中类群之间年均保护成本的差异;其中, 美国的数据集由于持续年限不同, 我们还对其计算了类群之间总保护成本的差异。结果显示, 虽然对每个物种的保护成本相差很大, 但在不同国家情况是一致的。例如, 哺乳动物的平均保护成本是植物的 8-26 倍, 是水生无脊椎动物的 13-19 倍。而鸟类的平均保护成本则是植物的 5-30 倍, 同时是水生无脊椎动物的 6-14 倍。这样的差异可能会加剧类群之间资源分配的不平等, 使更受喜爱的类群受到更多关注的同时还得到更多资源, 从而导致其它类群受到忽视。【翻译:胡怡思;审校:聂永刚】.",2020-02-01,Conservation Biology,https://openalex.org/V98137347,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13382,276,281,34,1,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2955449948,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13382,journal-article,2955449948

Nitrogen limitation activates virulence-associated behaviours in F. graminearum including mycotoxin production and penetrative growth. In other filamentous fungi, nitrogen sensing is mediated by both the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) and the glutamine synthetase (GS)-dependent signaling pathways. While TOR-dependent nitrogen responses have been demonstrated in F. graminearum, the involvement of GS remains unclear. Our study indicates that both the TOR and GS signalling pathways are involved in nitrogen sensing in F. graminearum and contribute to glutamine-induced mycelial growth. However, neither pathway is required for glutamine-induced repression of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) indicating that an additional nitrogen sensing pathway must exist. Further, two genes FgBMH1 and FgBMH2 encoding 14-3-3 proteins regulate nitrogen responses with effects on gene expression, DON production and mycelial growth. Unlike yeast, where 14-3-3s function redundantly in regulating nitrogen sensing, the 14-3-3 proteins have differing functions in F. graminearum. While both FgBMH1 and FgBMH2 regulate early glutamine-induced DON repression, only FgBMH2 is involved in regulating reproduction, virulence and glutamine-induced AreA repression. Together, our findings help to clarify the nitrogen sensing pathways in F. graminearum and highlight the involvement of 14-3-3s in the nitrogen response of filamentous fungi.",2020-01-01,Fungal Genetics and Biology,https://openalex.org/V51923826,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.103277,103277,103277,134,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980228796,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.103277,journal-article,2980228796

Based on this characterization, our design aims at eliminating a targeted collection of trapping sets. Considering the parent/child relationship between the trapping sets in the collection, we search for and eliminate those trapping sets that are in the collection but are not a child of any other trapping set in the collection. An efficient layered algorithm is designed for the search of these targeted trapping sets. Compared to the existing codes in the literature, the designed codes are superior in the sense that they are free of the same collection of trapping sets while having a smaller block length, or a larger collection of trapping sets while having the same block length. In addition, the efficiency of the search algorithm makes it possible to design codes with larger degrees which are free of trapping sets within larger ranges compared to the state-of-the-art.",2020-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Communications,https://openalex.org/V196647941,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcomm.2019.2953601,697,712,68,2,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2985618070,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcomm.2019.2953601,journal-article,2985618070

For example, the wood frog survives whole-body freezing every winter, arresting all gross physiological functions, but recovers functions upon thawing in the spring. Likewise, many small mammals hibernate for months at a time with minimal metabolic activity, organ perfusion, and movement, yet do not suffer significant muscle atrophy upon arousal. These conditions and the biochemical adaptations employed to deal with them can be viewed as Nature's answer to problems that humans wish to answer, particularly in a biomedical context. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of animal environmental stress adaptation, starting with an emphasis on new areas of research such as epigenetics and microRNA. We then examine new and emerging technologies such as genome editing, novel sequencing applications, and single cell analysis and how these can push us closer to a deeper understanding of biochemical adaptation. Next, evaluate the potential contributions of new high-throughput technologies (e.g. next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry proteomics) to better understanding the adaptations that support these extreme phenotypes.

Metabarcoding approaches have allowed widespread characterization of predator diets with high taxonomic resolution. To determine the wider impacts of predators, researchers should combine DNA techniques with estimates of population size of predators using mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods, and with accurate metrics of food consumption by individuals. Herein, we estimate the scale of predation exerted by four damselfly species on diverse prey taxa within a well-defined 12-ha study area, resolving the prey species of individual damselflies, to what extent the diets of predatory species overlap, and which fraction of the main prey populations are consumed. We identify the taxonomic composition of diets using DNA metabarcoding and quantify damselfly population sizes by MRR. We also use predator-specific estimates of consumption rates, and independent data on prey emergence rates to estimate the collective predation pressure summed over all prey taxa and specific to their main prey (non-biting midges or chironomids) of the four damselfly species. The four damselfly species collectively consumed a prey mass equivalent to roughly 87 (95% CL 410-1,800) g, over  months. Each individual consumed 29%-66% (95% CL 9.4-123) of its body weight during its relatively short life span (2.1-4.7 days; 95% CL 0.74-7.9) in the focal population. This predation pressure was widely distributed across the local invertebrate prey community, including  classes, 1 orders and c. 14 genera. Different predator species showed extensive overlap in diets, with an average of 30% of prey shared by at least two predator species. Of the available prey individuals in the widely consumed family Chironomidae, only a relatively small proportion (0.76%; 95% CL 0.35%-1.61%) were consumed. Our synthesis of population sizes, per-capita consumption rates and taxonomic distribution of diets identifies damselflies as a comparatively minor predator group of aerial insects. As the next step, we should add estimates of predation by larger odonate species, and experimental removal of odonates, thereby establishing the full impact of odonate predation on prey communities.",2020-06-01,Journal of Animal Ecology,https://openalex.org/V33456383,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13184,1365,1374,89,6,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2993934761,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13184,journal-article,2993934761

Taking seriously Patricia Hill Collins’ (2017) call to analyze “intensified points of convergence” (p. 1464), we analyze the role of social work in perpetuating carceral systems and the tools that feminist social work provides for disrupting them. Using a case analysis of a foster child in Halifax, Canada, who in 2018 was faced with deportation after social workers failed to secure his citizenship status, we argue that a pipeline exists between child protection and a growing “crimmigration” system. The carceral logics of this pipeline not only draw from anti-Black, Islamophobic, and settler colonial histories of oppression, but they also position certain noncitizen families as unassimilable and requiring of state intervention rather than social supports. With this carceral pipeline in mind, we then draw from feminist anticarceral and intersectional approaches to consider a range of resistance strategies. Ultimately, we argue for a transformative justice approach that goes beyond reforming the pipeline and instead takes seriously the insights of abolitionist movements as an alternative to purely reformist approaches.",2020-02-01,Affilia,https://openalex.org/V190691735,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886109919866165,34,48,35,1,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994744453,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886109919866165,journal-article,2994744453

Due to a lack of environmental control and regulations at that time, it was common for mines to dispose of their waste into adjacent lakes and land depressions, concentrating metals and metalloids in sensitive aquatic ecosystems. In order to examine what impacts, if any, these century-old, arsenic-rich mine tailings are having on present-day aquatic ecosystems, we sampled diatom assemblages in lake surface sediment in 24 lakes along a gradient of surface water arsenic contamination (0.4-972 μg/L). In addition, we examined sedimentary Cladocera and chironomid abundances and community composition, as well as open-water zooplankton communities and chlorophyll-a concentrations in of these study lakes along a gradient of arsenic contamination (0.9-1113 μg/L). Our results show that present-day arsenic concentration is not a significant driver of biotic community composition of the organisms we studied, but instead, that other variables such as lake depth and pH were more important in structuring assemblages. These results suggest that, while legacy contamination has greatly increased metal concentration beyond historical conditions, variability in lake-specific controls among the study lakes appear to be more important in the structuring of diatom, Cladocera, chironomidae, and zooplankton in these lakes.",2020-03-20,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136212,136212,136212,709,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994857310,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136212,journal-article,2994857310

The current study examines whether a short-term enrichment protocol can induce similar effects in adults as compared to juveniles. Using juvenile and adult wild-type mice, we examined the effects of short-term environmental enrichment (including a running wheel) on cognitive abilities, anxiety-like behaviour, and the stem cell potential of sub-ventricular neural stem cells (NSC's) in vitro using neurosphere assays. We found that short-term environmental enrichment decreased anxiety behaviour and increased overall memory abilities similarly in juveniles and adults. However, the rate of acquisition on the Morris water maze, hippocampal Sox2 and Ki67 expression, and neurosphere potential increased in response to enrichment only in juveniles, suggesting that the effects of enrichment on these measures are age dependant.

Along the northwestern Siberian cratonic margin (Turukhansk uplift, Yenisei Ridge) the basins accumulated predominantly 2.6–2.5 Ga zircons with eHf (T) values of +3 to −7, and 1.9–1.85 Ga zircons, characterized by eHf (T) values of −1 to +10. In the southwestern part of the craton (Prisayan uplift), similar 1.9–1.85 Ga and older Archean zircons are common, whereas in the eastern part older Paleoproterozoic zircons of 2.15–1.95 Ga with minimum eHf (T) values of −2 are widespread. The unique detrital age spectra for various parts of the craton provide a basis for unravelling the age of buried domains of the Siberian craton. A correlation of isotopic records from different domains, combined with geological evidence, may suggest that the craton consists of (1) the Archean unit, younging toward the present N-W direction and (2) three N-S-trending Paleoproterozoic collisional belts, extending along its western (the Angara belt) and eastern (the Hapschan belt) margins, and in the middle of the craton (the Magan belt). The proposed structural and isotopic domains of the Siberian craton compare well with those of northern Laurentia, providing a new evidence for the two cratons were connected within the Nuna supercontinent.",2020-05-01,Precambrian Research,https://openalex.org/V1025118869,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105645,105645,105645,340,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004391637,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105645,journal-article,3004391637

Considerable investment has been made over the past 30 years, from local to global levels, in listening to children, affording them opportunity to speak out and to hold adults to account in the realisation of their rights. This experience has highlighted the extent to which listening to children is not only right in principle, but is also a necessary and invaluable means through which to strengthen protection from violence, exploitation and abuse. Only by listening to children it is possible to fully understand the nature, scale and impact of violence in their lives and to develop appropriate responses and services. Only if children can speak out about the violence or abuse they face, does it become possible to challenge it and end impunity for those who seek to hurt children. The right to participate is not only fundamental to children's dignity, and sense of self-esteem and selfefficacy, but is also a vital dimension of their protection. However, in most countries around the world, multiple barriers impede its realisation. If violence against children is to be ended, investment is now needed in measures to build an enabling environment in which every child, including the very young, children with disabilities and those from the most marginalised communities, is able to contribute meaningfully to the decisions that impact on their lives, and to challenge violations of their rights.",2020-02-27,Child Abuse & Neglect,https://openalex.org/V53055215,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104398,104398,104398,110,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008644940,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104398,journal-article,3008644940

The research reported here presents the first deployment of a previously published proxy tool based on Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) for monitoring road salt contamination. The research was conducted at Silver Lake in Eastern Ontario, a 4-km-long lake with the heavily traveled Trans-Canada Highway (HWY 7) transiting the entire southern shore. The lake showed elevated conductivity (297–310 μS/cm) and sub-brackish conditions (0.14–0.15 ppt). Sodium levels were also elevated near the roadside (median Na = 1020 ppm). Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling results revealed four distinct Arcellinida assemblages: “Stressed Cool Water Assemblage (SCWA),” “Deep Cold Water Assemblage (DCWA),” both from below the 8-m thermocline, and the shallower water “Shallow Water Assemblage  (SWA-1)” and “Shallow Water Assemblage  (SWA-2)”. Redundancy analysis showed a minor response of Arcellinida to road salt contamination in shallower areas of the lake, with confounding variables significantly impacting assemblage distribution, particularly beneath the thermocline (e.g., water temperature, water depth, sediment runoff from catchment [Ti], sediment geochemistry [Ca, S]). The results of this study indicate that the trophic structure of the lake has to date only been modestly impacted by the cumulative nature of road salt contamination. Nonetheless, the Silver Lake results should be considered of concern and warrant continued arcellinidan biomonitoring to gauge the ongoing and long-term effects of road salt on its ecosystem.",2020-05-08,Microbial Ecology,https://openalex.org/V97758720,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01513-w,366,383,80,2,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023861367,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01513-w,journal-article,3023861367

We implement an empirical approach to measure discrimination across several dimensions that integrates a set of relevant parameters into one unified system of equations. We find statistically significant negative estimates of a media exposure effect. People residing in the area which received negative publicity were 3.2 percentage points less likely to receive a callback.

This is accomplished in part by the accumulation of cryoprotectant glucose, metabolic rate depression, and stress response activation. These may be achieved by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which is typically associated with transcriptional repression. Hyperglycemia is also associated with modifications to epigenetic profiles, indicating an additional role that the high levels of glucose play in freeze tolerance. We sought to determine whether DNA methylation is affected during freezing exposure, and whether this is due to the wood frog’s response to hyperglycemia. We examined global DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the liver and muscle of frozen and glucose-loaded wood frogs. The results showed that levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) increased in the muscle, suggesting elevated DNA methylation during freezing. DNMT activities also decreased in muscle during thawing, glucose loading, and in vitro glucose experiments. Liver DNMT activities were similar to muscle; however, a varied response to DNMT levels and a decrease in 5mC highlight the metabolic role the liver plays during freezing. Glucose was also shown to decrease DNMT activity levels in the wood frog, in vitro, elucidating a potentially novel regulatory mechanism.

Biological indicators have been proposed as indirect measures of contaminants that can be used to reduce chemical monitoring costs by identifying pollution hotspots that warrant thorough chemical testing. Many general indicators are based on taxonomic properties of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. However, it has been suggested that metrics based on traits, rather than taxa, can be used to develop more chemical-specific and efficient indicators. Here, we investigate whether macroinvertebrate family-level traits can be used as simple indicators of elevated levels of specific pollutants in farmland drainage ditches, to reveal areas in need of further chemical monitoring. We selected seven traits—body size, body armouring, feeding guild, habit, oxygen acquisition, dispersal mode, and voltinism—that we predicted would influence sensitivity to nitrate, to the two herbicides atrazine and glyphosate, and to neonicotinoid insecticides, and tested whether any trait-chemical relationships were strong enough to be reliable bioindicators. We collected macroinvertebrate samples and water samples for agrichemical analyses from 27 farmland ditches in Eastern Ontario, Canada. We indexed the sensitivity of each sampled macroinvertebrate family to the concentration of each agrichemical, using coefficients from multiple logistic regressions of family absence/presence on the concentrations of the four agrichemicals. We reduced the seven traits predicted to influence sensitivity to four—body armouring, oxygen acquisition, dispersal mode, and voltinism—after examining their inter-dependencies. We then tested for cross-family relationships between sensitivity to each chemical and the trait categories for each macroinvertebrate family. Two traits, oxygen acquisition and dispersal mode, were significantly associated with two agrichemical sensitivity coefficients: nitrate sensitivity was associated with mode of oxygen acquisition, with atmospheric breathers having a higher mean sensitivity coefficient than dissolved-oxygen breathers, and glyphosate sensitivity was related to dispersal mode, with passive dispersers having a higher mean sensitivity coefficient than active dispersers. However, inspection of these relationships revealed that the responses lacked enough consistency across families to be reliable, chemical-specific indicators. Instead, a taxa-level, post-hoc analysis indicated that further work should be conducted to determine whether there are individual taxa whose presence at a site is a strong indicator of a lack or low levels of certain contaminants. In particular, the presence of Corixidae appears to indicate low ditch nitrate levels. Overall, however, our results combined with previous work suggest that we are unlikely to find chemical-specific macroinvertebrate indicators that are more efficient than a rigorous chemical sampling scheme.",2020-04-01,Ecological Indicators,https://openalex.org/V194154261,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105965,,,,,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2994053406,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105965,journal-article,2994053406

This technique is common in urban landscapes focused at a city-wide spatial scale. Our study tested the applicability of LUR modelling at a local scale, defined as multiple air monitors within a neighbourhood. The study area was 15.4 km of an urban transportation corridor in Mississauga, Canada. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was sampled at 11 sites during the summer in 201 and observations ranged from 5.8 ppb to 19.65 ppb. A linear regression LUR model explained 69% of the variation in NO2 concentrations at this local scale, with estimated prediction errors less than 1.61 ppb, which were calculated by three cross-validation methods. Traffic volume, major and minor road lengths were key determinants among the predictor variables, and park area and distance to the nearest major intersection were the only variables with negative coefficients in the local-scale model. Extending the linear model approach with regression kriging improved the model's explanatory ability with a coefficient of determination at 0.91; however, smaller improvements were observed during cross-validation. Leave-one-out cross-validation for the linear model LUR model (RMSE = 1.44 ppb and a R2 = 0.64) and the regression kriging LUR model (RMSE = 1.34 ppb and a R2 = 0.69) were similar.

They can be broadly grouped into two subfamilies: short pentraxins and long pentraxins. Pentraxins regulate many processes in the brain as well as the periphery. Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2/NPTX2), also known as neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp), is an immediate-early gene that has been shown to play a critical role in guiding synaptic plasticity. NP2 has been previously linked to excitatory neurotransmission, based on its ability to aggregate excitatory receptors in the central nervous system. The mechanisms mediating the effects of NP2 on excitatory neurotransmission remain unclear and warrants further investigation. This review article focuses on the biological features of NP2 and discusses the literature supporting a role for NP2 and other pentraxins in glutamatergic signaling.

Pseudospectral numerical schemes for solving the Dirac equation in general static curved space are derived using a new pseudodifferential representation of the Dirac equation along with a simple Fourier-basis technique. Owing to the presence of non-constant coefficients in the curved space Dirac equation, convolution products usually appear when the Fourier transform is performed. To circumvent this problem, a strategy based on operator splitting and pseudodifferential operators allows for using an ordinary fast Fourier transform algorithm. The resulting numerical methods are efficient and have spectral convergence.

In a number of these cases, the defendant was well known within their community (e.g., Brock Turner; People v. Turner) or nationally (e.g., Ghomeshi; R v. Ghomeshi). The purpose of this study was to examine how the social status of the defendant (low vs. high), victim social status (low vs. high), victim gender (male vs. female), and the reason the victim was unconscious during the assault (consuming alcohol vs. consuming cold medicine) influenced mock jurors' decisions in a sexual assault case. Mock jurors (N = 489) read a mock trial transcript depicting an alleged sexual assault. Mock jurors were asked to render a dichotomous verdict, continuous guilt rating, and rate their perceptions of the victim and defendant. There was no influence of the variables on mock jurors' dichotomous verdicts; however, social status influenced guilt ratings. There also was a combined influence of the defendant's social status and the reason the victim was unconscious such that when the defendant was described as low status, and the victim was unconscious due to alcohol consumption, the defendant received higher guilt ratings compared with when the victim was unconscious due to cold medicine. Moreover, the victim was perceived as having more control over the situation when the defendant was the star quarterback (i.e., high status), the victim was female, and she was unconscious due to alcohol consumption compared with cold medicine.

Depression has also been tied to fewer social relationships, which can vary by gender.

In this study, a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the treatment of CA by zero-valent iron (ZVI) under various water chemistry conditions. It was observed that CA was removed by ZVI via both adsorption and degradation, with the degradation rate being proportional to the fraction of CA adsorbed onto ZVI. The rate of CA degradation decreased as pH increased, presumably due to the passivation of ZVI and diminishing CA adsorption. Chloride (Cl-) did not appreciably affect CA adsorption and degradation, while sulfate (SO42-) significantly inhibited both processes because SO42- competed with CA for ZVI adsorptive sites. The rate of CA degradation was significantly accelerated by ZVI-associated Fe(II). Nine byproducts of CA transformation were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The formation and subsequent degradation of these products revealed that the transformation of CA by ZVI occurred via a step-wise reductive dechlorination pathway.

This brings great difficulty to collect a large amount of data. Instead of collecting the data individually, computation over multi-access channels (CoMAC) provides an intelligent solution by computing a desired function over the air based on the signal-superposition property of wireless channels. To improve the spectrum efficiency in conventional CoMAC, we propose the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for functions in CoMAC. The desired functions are decomposed into several sub-functions, and multiple sub-functions are selected to be superposed over each resource block (RB). The corresponding achievable rate is derived based on sub-function superposition, which prevents a vanishing computation rate for large numbers of nodes. We further study the limiting case when the number of nodes goes to infinity. An exact expression of the rate is derived that provides a lower bound on the computation rate. Compared with existing CoMAC, the NOMA-based CoMAC not only achieves a higher computation rate but also provides an improved non-vanishing rate. Furthermore, the diversity order of the computation rate is derived, which shows that the system performance is dominated by the node with the worst channel gain among these sub-functions in each RB.",2020-01-09,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,https://openalex.org/V63459445,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1109/twc.2019.2963654,2252,2267,19,4,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999647825,https://doi.org/10.1109/twc.2019.2963654,journal-article,2999647825

In the proposed approach, the EM responses of passive components versus frequency are represented by pole–zero–gain transfer functions. The relationships between the poles/zeros/gain in the transfer function and geometrical variables are learned by neural networks. To generate training data, we apply the MPVL algorithm to compute (or recompute) the poles/zeros each time we change the geometrical parameters. However, the indices of the poles/zeros after the recomputation may not have clear correspondences with those before the recomputation, posing additional challenges to predict the poles/zeros reliably for a new change of geometrical parameters. We propose a novel sensitivity-analysis-based pole-/zero-matching algorithm to obtain the correct correspondences between the poles/zeros at different geometrical parameter values. The proposed algorithm exploits the EM sensitivities, which provide useful information for the direction of movement of the poles/zeros, to predict the new positions of the poles/zeros for each change of geometrical parameters in the multidimensional parameter space. The predicted new positions are then used to guide the matching process of poles/zeros between different geometrical parameter values. Using the matched poles/zeros to train the neural networks allows us to have fast and reliable predictions for the poles/zeros subject to large geometrical variations, consequently increasing the accuracy and robustness of the overall model. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed approach can obtain better accuracy in challenging applications involving large geometrical variations.

Leveraging radiometric observations along a detector's line-of-sight, these techniques resolve column density information from which pollutant loading and emission rates can be deduced for an in situ atmospheric plume of a targeted source. One commonly neglected source of uncertainty in such measurements is beam steering – the deflection of light as it traverses the plume due to composition- and temperature-driven gradients in the real refractive index field of the plume. In this work, three correction parameters were derived from the radiative transfer equation to enable consideration of beam steering effects on these measurement techniques. A Monte Carlo procedure was performed to derive realistic optical axes through plumes of large-eddy-simulated gas flares, considered to be an extreme case of beam steering due to elevated temperature and composition gradients near the flame. Deflections of light due to beam steering were quantified at wavelengths in the visible spectrum and within three diagnostic-relevant infrared absorption bands for methane and carbon dioxide. A conservative, empirical model for the degree of beam steering was derived. Moreover, from these data, correction parameters required to account for the impact of beam steering on perceived incident intensity, optical depth, and source intensity were found to be negligible at all studied wavelengths relative to typical instrument noise. Thus, this work demonstrates that even for the extreme case of a turbulent heated flare plume, beam steering has negligible impact on the ability to quantify pollutant loading and emissions.",2020-06-27,Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy & Radiative Transfer,https://openalex.org/V100373537,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107191,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3037728107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107191,journal-article,3037728107

In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this routing scheme is guaranteed to succeed. In 200 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy drawings. The greedy embedding conjecture states that every 3-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The convex greedy embedding conjecture asserts that every 3-connected planar graph admits a planar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons. In 200 the greedy embedding conjecture was settled in the positive by Leighton and Moitra. In this paper we prove that every 3-connected planar graph admits a planar greedy drawing. Apart from being a strengthening of Leighton and Moitra’s result, this theorem constitutes a natural intermediate step towards a proof of the convex greedy embedding conjecture.",2020-01-01,Discrete and Computational Geometry,https://openalex.org/V103671469,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-018-0001-5,114,157,63,1,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2566851301,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-018-0001-5,journal-article,2566851301

The interaction of trend inflation with nominal wage rigidity and trend growth in output causes large distortions in the steady state and expands the indeterminacy region. Consequently, even interest rate rules with strong inflation responses may not be sufficient to ensure determinacy. A policy rule reacting to output growth but not to output gap significantly increases the prospect of determinacy.

An enhanced model of visual attention, consisting of information about color, contrast, curvature, entropy, symmetry, intensity, and orientation is developed to assist in selection of only relevant regions to be probed over the surface of an object. We aim to demonstrate that this visual information can be successfully employed to recognize the object from local tactile data, following the idea of haptic glance exhibited by humans (i.e., object recognition by a limited number of static contacts between the object and a finger). Due to the time-consuming nature of real tactile data acquisition, the process is first simulated and tested over a set of virtual objects prior to testing it on real rigid objects. A series of classifiers is trained and tested for the object recognition task and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy. The $k$ -nearest neighbor classifier is shown to be the most promising algorithm among the tested classifiers for the object recognition task, both for simulated data (85.42% for four objects and 76.37% for six objects) and for real tactile sensor data (66.76% for four objects and 58.97% for six objects) when single imprints are used as a basis for recognition.

High resolution plant macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating were undertaken on two cores, with lower resolution geochemical analysis conducted on one of these cores. We provide evidence of a palaeolake with a late Glacial origin (older than 12,500 years). Abundant fossil presence of macrophytes (e.g. multiple Potamogeton species) in the studied palaeomeander may indicate that the north–south orientation of the Prosna valley made it an important route for the spreading of aquatic plants during the late Glacial. Chara sp., Batrachium sp. and Potamogeton spp. were the pioneer plants that colonised cold water with a high Ca 2+ content. Early Holocene warming trigged a decrease in water level at the oxbow lake and facilitated the expansion of thermophilous water plants, for example, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha sp. and Lemna trisulca, which usually occur in shallow water. A decreasing water level resulted in the gradual isolation of the study site from the influence of groundwater, leading to acidification of the habitat and the development of a Sphagnum population, with S. contortum and S. teres as dominant species. The presence of S. contortum (the oldest occurrence in the European lowlands) and S. teres during the early Holocene may indicate that river valleys and the peatlands that developed in this region acted as an important habitats (and possibly refugia) for some minerotrophic Sphagnum species.",2020-01-01,The Holocene,https://openalex.org/V16821847,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683619875803,,,,,1,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975298254,https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683619875803,journal-article,2975298254

To determine the contributions of each mutation, in this work we generated individual castor desaturase mutants carrying residue changes corresponding to those in the triple mutant and investigated their catalytic activities. We observed that T117R, and to a lesser extent D280K, accumulated a novel product, namely erythro-9,10-dihydroxystearate, that we identified via its methyl ester through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and comparison with authentic standards. The use of 18O2 labeling showed that the oxygens of both hydroxyl moieties originate from molecular oxygen rather than water. Incubation with an equimolar mixture of 18O2 and 16O2 demonstrated that both hydroxyl oxygens originate from a single molecule of O2, proving the product is the result of dioxygenase catalysis. Using prolonged incubation, we discovered that wild-type castor desaturase is also capable of forming erythro-9,10-dihydroxystearate, which presents a likely explanation for its accumulation to ∼0.7% in castor oil, the biosynthetic origin of which had remained enigmatic for decades.

We examined whether the lineup advantage extends from facial identification to forensic-object identification. Participants (N = 1906) watched a short video of a car theft and then completed two culprit-present or culprit-absent showups or lineups. Participants first attempted to identify the culprit from the video and then attempted to identify the vehicle from the video. Forensic-object lineups were superior to forensic-object showups to the extent that the cost of an innocent-suspect identification exceeded the cost of a missed culprit identification or to the extent that the base rate of culprit presence was low. Importantly, we are referring to actual costs and base rates in the real world rather than to methods of manipulating witness decision criteria (see Clark, 201 for a similar approach).

Extending an ERP-based ACT–R (Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational) neurocognitive modeling approach, we tested whether visual sustained selective-set attention in preschool children involves the enhancement of neural response to targets, and it shows key adult-like features (neurofunctional homology). Blinded automatic peaks analysis was conducted on vincentized binned grand ERP averages. Time-course and distribution of scalp activity were detailed through topographic mapping and paths analysis. Reaction times and accuracy were also measured. Adult Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based mapping using ACT–R dipole source modeling and electric-field spiking simulation provided very good fit with the actual ERP data (R2 &gt; 0.70). In most electrodes, between 5 and 40 ms, ERPs concurrent with target presentation were enhanced relative to distractor, without manual response confounds. Triangulation of peak analysis, ACT–R modeling and simulation for the entire ERP epochs up to the moment of manual response (~700 ms, on average) suggested converging evidence of distinct but interacting processes of enhancement and planning for response release/inhibition, respectively. The latter involved functions and structures consistent with adult ERP activity which might correspond to a large-scale network, implicating Dorsal and Ventral Attentional Networks, corticostriatal loops, and subcortical hubs connected to prefrontal cortex top-down working memory executive control.

Here, two well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus (CMN 8920 and CMN 8919) are CT scanned to describe their neurosensory structures and infer sensory capability. The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment.

This article demonstrates a 14-GHz bang-bang digital phase-locked loop (BBPLL) with 143-fs rms jitter (integrated from  kHz to 10 MHz) to clock a 56-Gb/s PAM-4 transceiver. The low jitter is achieved with an LC -based digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) having a tuning range of  GHz, a frequency resolution of 1.2 MHz/LSB, and a low phase noise of −104 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. All PLL digital functions are consolidated in a single, fully synthesized digital signal processing unit operating at 3.5 GHz or 1 $\times $ the reference clock frequency. Limit cycles are minimized without the aid of a time-to-digital converter through substantial reduction of loop latency using a look-ahead digital loop filter. Various design techniques exploiting the advanced 7-nm FinFET technology are discussed, including noise reduction and tank ${Q}$ enhancement. Closed-loop phase noise performance is accurately predicted using an industry-standard digital event-driven simulator with dramatically reduced computation effort compared to analog or mixed-mode simulators. Here, the accuracy and computational burden of calculating 1/ ${f}^{\alpha }$ noise is overcome by pre-calculating the DCO and reference phase noise profiles. The results obtained from these simulation techniques show very close agreement with experimental measurements.

However, little is known about the factors that could moderate these relationships. The present study examined the associations between energy drink consumption and psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts among adolescents, and tested whether sex and school type (i.e. middle vs. high school) would moderate these associations. Methods Data on students in grades  through 1 was obtained from the 201 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (N  =  5,538). Multivariable Poisson regression analyses were used to examine associations between energy drink consumption and mental health outcomes. Analyses were weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design. Results Energy drink consumption was associated with greater risk of moderate to serious (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.37) and serious (IRR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.13–1.86) levels of psychological distress, suicidal thoughts (IRR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.62–2.42), and suicide attempts (IRR: 3.67, 95% CI: 2.26–5.95). The association between energy drink consumption and mental health outcomes was much stronger among boys and middle school students. Limitations The cross-sectional nature of the data precludes causal inferences and there is possibility of bias related to self-reports.

RBPs that are expressed in response to cold stress, such as Cirp and Rbm3, could regulate RNA stability and translation in hibernating mammals that reduce their body temperatures from 37 °C to as low as 0–5 °C during torpor bouts. RBPs including Cirp, Rbm3, and stress-inducible HuR translocate from the nucleus to stabilize mRNAs in the cytoplasm, and thereby could regulate which mRNA transcripts are protected from degradation and are translated, versus stored, for future protein synthesis or degraded by nucleases during cell stress associated with metabolic rate depression. This is the first study to explore the transcriptional/translational regulation, and subcellular localization of cold-inducible RBPs in a model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Cirp protein levels were upregulated in liver, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue throughout the torpor-arousal cycle whereas Rbm3 protein levels stayed constant or decreased, suggesting an important role for Cirp, but likely not Rbm3, in the hibernator stress response. Increased cytoplasmic localization of Cirp in liver and muscle and HuR in liver during torpor, but no changes in the relative levels of Rbm3 in the cytoplasm, emphasizes a role for Cirp and possibly HuR in regulating mRNA processing during torpor.

Similarly, ghrelin, a gut-secreted hormone, is also associated with weight gain, adiposity, and increased feeding. Here we sought to determine if corticosterone-induced metabolic and behavioral changes require functional ghrelin receptors (GHSR). To do this, we treated male C57BL mice with chronic corticosterone (CORT) mixed in their drinking water for 28 days. Half of these mice received the GHSR antagonist JMV2959 via osmotic minipumps while treated with CORT. In a second experiment, we gave the same CORT protocol to mice with a targeted mutation to the GHSR or their wild-type littermates. As expected, CORT treatment increased food intake, weight gain, and adiposity, but contrary to expectations, mice treated with a GHSR receptor antagonist or GHSR knockout (KO) mice did not show attenuated food intake, weight gain, or adiposity in response to CORT. Similarly, the effects of CORT on the liver were the same or more pronounced in GHSR antagonist-treated and GHSR KO mice. Treatment with JMV2959 did attenuate the effects of chronic CORT on glycemic regulation as determined by the glucose tolerance test. Finally, disruption of GHSR signaling resulted in behavioral responses associated with social withdrawal, potentially due to neuroprotective effects of GHSR activation. In all, we propose that blocking GHSR signaling helps to moderate glucose concentrations when CORT levels are high, but blocking GHSR signaling does not prevent increased food intake, weight gain, or increased adiposity produced by chronic CORT.",2020-03-01,Endocrinology,https://openalex.org/V157527038,The Endocrine Society,https://doi.org/10.1210/endocr/bqz023,,,161,3,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989838574,https://doi.org/10.1210/endocr/bqz023,journal-article,2989838574

Although choristodere skulls are well described externally, their internal anatomy remains unknown. An internal description was needed to shed light on peculiarities of the choristodere skull, such as paired gaps on the ventral surface of the skull that may pertain to the fenestra ovalis, and a putative neomorphic ossification in the lateral wall of the braincase. Our goals were: (i) to describe the cranial elements of Champsosaurus lindoei in three dimensions; (ii) to describe paired gaps on the ventral surface of the skull to determine if these are indeed the fenestrae ovales; (iii) to illustrate the morphology of the putative neomorphic bone; and (iv) to consider the possible developmental and functional origins of the neomorph. We examined the cranial anatomy of the choristodere Champsosaurus lindoei (CMN 8920) using high‐resolution micro‐computed tomography scanning. We found that the paired gaps on the ventral surface of the skull do pertain to the fenestrae ovales, an unusual arrangement that may be convergent with some plesiosaurs, some aistopods, and some urodeles. The implications of this morphology in Champsosaurus are unknown and will be the subject of future work. We found that the neomorphic bone is a distinct ossification, but is not part of the wall of the brain cavity or the auditory capsule. Variation in the developmental pathways of cranial bones in living amniotes was surveyed to determine how the neomorphic bone may have developed. We found that the chondrocranium and splanchnocranium show little to no variation across amniotes, and the neomorphic bone is therefore most likely to have developed from the dermatocranium; however, the stapes is a pre‐existing cranial element that is undescribed in choristoderes and may be homologous with the neomorphic bone. If the neomorphic bone is not homologous with the stapes, the neomorph likely developed from the dermatocranium through incomplete fusion of ossification centres from a pre‐existing bone, most likely the parietal. Based on the apparent morphology of the neomorph in Coeruleodraco, the neomorph was probably too small to play a significant structural role in the skull of early choristoderes and it may have arisen through non‐adaptive means. In neochoristoderes, such as Champsosaurus, the neomorph was likely recruited to support the expanded temporal arches.",2020-01-06,Journal of Anatomy,https://openalex.org/V31465112,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13134,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000189935,https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13134,journal-article,3000189935

Chilling injury is often associated with a loss of ion balance across the gut epithelia. It has recently been suggested that this imbalance is at least partly caused by a cold-induced disruption of epithelial barrier function. Here, we aim to test this hypothesis in the migratory locust (L. migratoria). First, chill tolerance was quantified by exposing locusts to -2°C and quantified chill coma recovery time and survival 24h post-cold exposure. Longer exposure times significantly increased recovery time and caused injury and death. Ion-selective microelectrodes were also used to test for a loss of ion balance in the cold. We found a significant increase and decrease of hemolymph K+ and Na+ concentrations over time, respectively. Next, barrier failure along the gut was tested by monitoring the movement of an epithelial barrier marker (FITC-dextran) across the gut epithelia during exposure to -2°C. We found a significant increase in hemolymph FITC-dextran concentrations over time in the cold when assayed in the mucosal to serosal direction. However, when tested in the serosal to mucosal direction, we saw minimal marker movement across the gut epithelia. This suggests that while cold-induced barrier disruption is present, it is apparently unidirectional. It is important to note that these data reveal only the phenomenon itself.

These new methods are developed from several new findings reported in this paper, including (i) new analytical solutions that relate parameters of compressibility functions to the final density profile, (ii) analytical proof of the independence of the shape of the settlement curve from the parameter M, where the permeability or hydraulic conductivity k is given by Me P , e is void ratio, and M and P are material-related constants; and (iii) that when the same k function is employed, for the case of one-dimensional settlement, the optimal values of M and P are located on a unique straight line in the P–lnM space. The third finding was determined from optimization analysis of thousands of LSC simulations. Using different combinations of these new findings, three new methods are developed to estimate the permeability function. The efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of the three methods are investigated by their application to four column tests from the literature. The simplest of the three methods requires only two LSC analyses plus several hand-calculations, demonstrating strong potential for practical use.",2020-05-01,Canadian Geotechnical Journal,https://openalex.org/V105963835,Canadian Science Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2018-0870,683,705,57,5,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2950838294,https://doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2018-0870,journal-article,2950838294

A self-approaching path is a directed curve such that the Euclidean distance between a point moving along the path and any future position does not increase, that is, for all points a , b , and c that appear in that order along the curve, | a c | ≥ | b c | . We analyze properties of self-approaching paths inside simple polygons, and characterize shortest self-approaching paths. In particular, we show that a shortest self-approaching path connecting two points in a simple polygon can be forced to follow a general class of non-algebraic curves. While this makes it difficult to design an exact algorithm, we show how to find the shortest self-approaching path under a model of computation which assumes that we can compute involute curves of high order.

It makes the transition much sharper, reduces the critical force remarkably, and the larger the persistent length or the intrinsic curvature, the larger the reduction in critical force. The transition is caused by a collective change in bending angles associated with removing cusps owing to thermal fluctuation. Our results reveal that EVI can excite a cooperative behavior, straighten more bonds simultaneously so cause a sharper transition. The transition is dominated by the mechanical force because the specific heat does not divergence.

However, the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness-related traits remains incompletely explained. The extent of genetic variation in obligately self-fertilizing populations of Lobelia inflata (Campanulaceae L.) strongly implies balancing selection. Lobelia inflata thus offers an exceptional opportunity for an empirical test of genotype-environment interaction (G × E) as a variance-maintaining mechanism under fluctuating selection: L. inflata is monocarpic and reproduces only by seed, facilitating assessment of lifetime fitness; genome-wide homozygosity precludes some mechanisms of balancing selection, and microsatellites are, in effect, genotypic lineage markers. Here, we find support for the temporal G × E hypothesis using a manipulated space-for-time approach across four environments: a field environment, an outdoor experimental plot and two differing growth-chamber environments. High genetic variance was confirmed: 8 field-collected individuals consisted of 4 distinct microsatellite lineages with, on average, 4.5 alleles per locus. Rank-order fitness, measured as lifetime fruit production in 1 replicated multilocus genotypes, changed significantly across environments. Phenotypic differences among microsatellite lineages were detected. Results thus support the G × E hypothesis in principle. However, the evaluation of the effect size of this mechanism and fitness effects of life-history traits will require a long-term study of fluctuating selection on labelled genotypes in the field.",2020-03-18,Royal Society Open Science,https://openalex.org/V2737558550,The Royal Society,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191720,191720,191720,7,3,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012371929,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191720,journal-article,3012371929

Because increased sperm competition is a potential cost of mate-choice copying, males should be prudent and less likely to copy the observed mate choice of other males when the latter are more sexually attractive than themselves. We tested this hypothesis using the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Focal observer males were simultaneously presented with a large and a small female as potential mates, either in the presence or absence of a nearby model male. We varied the relative differences in the body length and colour ornamentation, traits that predict male sexual attractiveness and competitiveness in the guppy, of observer and model males in each of three experimental treatments: (1) observer and model males were matched for body length and colour ornamentation; (2) the model male was larger and more colourful than the observer male; (3) the model male was smaller and less colourful than the observer male. We compared the mating preferences of focal observer males in each of the latter treatments with that of focal males in a control treatment, wherein no model male (and thus no copying opportunity) was present. As predicted, focal males copied the staged apparent mate choice of a model male in all three experimental treatments, but not in the control treatment. However, contrary to our a priori hypothesis, there were no significant differences in the likelihood or strength of the copying response in observer males among the experimental treatments. Although male guppies are known to modify their mating tactics in the presence of sexual competitors, we found no evidence for an influence of the relative phenotypes of observer and model males on mate-choice copying behaviour in focal observer males.",2020-04-01,Animal Behaviour,https://openalex.org/V157690423,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.008,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012569748,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.02.008,journal-article,3012569748

It discusses Waldenfels’s own engagement with ethnology and shows the compatibility of his approach with discussions within the discipline. The intertwining of ownness and alienness that is central to Waldenfels’s account of experience is applied to the problem of culture in ethnology. This leads to an acknowledgement of a domain between cultures, a genuine interculturality, as the fundamental field of ethnological research, which, however, can only be addressed through indirect forms of representation. Such forms are identified in the practice of ethnographic citation, and through a reinterpretation of Horace Miner’s classical satire “Body Ritual among the Nacirema”, thus demonstrating the possibility of a prospective “responsive ethnology”.",2020-04-07,Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie,https://openalex.org/V95344940,Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag,https://doi.org/10.1515/dzph-2020-0006,101,120,68,1,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014798847,https://doi.org/10.1515/dzph-2020-0006,journal-article,3014798847

Too much obscuring organic material in a gridded wet Petri dish preparation makes it difficult to observe all specimens present and slows quantification as the organic material has to be carefully worked through with a dissection probe. Chemical deflocculation using soda ash (Na2CO3·H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), or sodium hexametaphosphate ((NaPO3)6) has previously been shown to disaggregate and reduce organic content in lake sediments, but to date, no attempt has been made to comparatively evaluate the efficiency of these deflocculants in disaggregating organic content and their impact on Arcellinida analysis in lacustrine sediments. Here, we assess the effectiveness of soda ash, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hexametaphosphate treatments on removing organic content and the impact of those digestions on Arcellinida preservation in 126 sample aliquots subdivided from three sediment samples (YK-20, YK-25, and YK-57) collected from three lakes near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Following treatment, cluster analysis and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix (BCDM) were utilized to determine whether treatments resulted in dissolution-driven changes in Arcellinida assemblage composition. Observed Arcellinida tests in aliquots increased drastically after treatment of organic-rich samples (47.5-452.7% in organic-rich aliquots and by 14.8% in aliquots with less organic matter). The BCDM results revealed that treatment with 5% KOH resulted in the highest reduction in observed organic content without significantly affecting Arcellinida assemblage structure, while soda ash and sodium hexametaphosphate treatments resulted in marginal organic matter reduction and caused severe damage to the arcellinidan tests.",2020-02-01,Microbial Ecology,https://openalex.org/V97758720,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01429-0,,,,,0,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2969935756,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01429-0,journal-article,2969935756

The ability of the turtle to facilitate this impressive tolerance to oxygen restriction is accomplished through a dramatic reduction in non-essential cellular processes. This is done in an attempt to conserve limited ATP stores and match demand in the anoxic state, with ATP supplied primarily through anaerobic glycolysis. Determining both the non-essential and the essential cellular processes that are deemed to be anoxia-responsive in the turtle has been an intense area of study over the past few decades. As a result, recent advancements have established the influence of global metabolic controls, such as post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of gene expression in anoxia adaptation. A remaining question is whether or not epigenetic-level regulatory mechanisms are also utilized to allow for local control over gene expression. Recently, research has begun to document lysine methylation as an anoxia-responsive post-translational histone modification, as the activities of a number of methyl-lysine regulatory enzymes are extraordinarily sensitive to oxygen availability. As a result, oxygen-dependent methyl-lysine regulatory enzymes have been of particular interest to several recent studies of animal oxygen sensitivity, including the freshwater turtle.
