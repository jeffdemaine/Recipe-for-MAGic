Research in the past decade has pointed to the broad benefits of trained immunity for host defence but has also suggested potentially detrimental outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases.

In a few countries, the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies. In contrast, the United States, hampered by limited testing capacity, has prioritized testing for specific groups of persons. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging. Although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation. Many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity. These challenges may be even greater in low-resource settings. Urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition-metal MXenes have become attractive nanomaterials for micro-supercapacitor applications due to their layered structure and high electrical conductivity. However, the low stability of MXenes in aqueous media limits their long-term storage and application. Here, we demonstrate in-situ synthesis and capping of Ti3C2Tx MXenes with sodium ascorbate (SA) to obtain SA-MXene dispersion with high resistance against oxidation even after 80 days of storage at ambient temperature and exposed to air. The in-situ synthesis process increases the interlayer spacing of SA-MXene sheets, and increases their energy storage efficiency, without compromising their electrical conductivity. A printable SA-MXene ink was prepared with Triton X-100 and propylene glycol as modifiers to print interdigitated micro-supercapacitor electrodes with an inkjet printer. Our solid-state micro-supercapacitor made without current collector exhibits areal and volumetric capacitance of 108.1 mF cm−2 and 720.7 F cm−3, respectively.

Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family2. Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter2. Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics-the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin-that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins-essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth.

Cancer-killing PARP-1 inhibitor (PARPi) compounds all block the same catalytic site but exhibit vastly different efficacy. Zandarashvili et al. investigated the molecular impact of PARPi binding to PARP-1 (see the Perspective by Slade and Eustermann). Different PARPi molecules perturb PARP-1 allostery in diverse manners: Some drive allostery to promote release of PARP-1 from DNA, and others drive allostery to promote retention. These insights help explain the different efficacies in the clinic and enable conversion of a pro-release, ineffective cancer-killing compound to a pro-retention, more effective PARPi.

Lipo- and glucolipotoxicity have been studied for over 2 years. Here, we review the current evidence supporting the role of pancreatic β-cell lipo- and glucolipotoxicity in type  diabetes (T2D), including lipid-based interventions in humans, prospective epidemiological studies, and human genetic findings. In addition to total FFA quantity, the quality of FFAs (saturation and chain length) is a key determinant of lipotoxicity. We discuss in vitro and in vivo experimental models to investigate lipo- and glucolipotoxicity in β-cells and describe experimental pitfalls. Lipo- and glucolipotoxicity adversely affect many steps of the insulin production and secretion process. The molecular mechanisms underpinning lipo- and glucolipotoxic β-cell dysfunction and death comprise endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and inflammation. Crosstalk between these stress pathways exists at multiple levels and may aggravate β-cell lipo- and glucolipotoxicity.

However, person-centered studies are sparse in the literature, and these could provide insight into whether there are individuals who use pornography frequently and do not experience problems or whether there are individuals with comparable high-frequency use who differ on reported experiencing of negative consequences.The aims of the present study were (i) to identify profiles of pornography use based on FPU and PPU by applying a person-centered analytic approach and (ii) to examine whether the identified profiles could be distinguished based on theoretically relevant demographic and psychological constructs.Latent profile analyses were conducted on 3 nonclinical samples recruited from general websites and a pornography site (study 1: N = 14,006; study 2: N = 483; study 3: N = 672).Results were consistent across all studies. 3 distinct pornography-use profiles emerged: nonproblematic low-frequency pornography use (68-73% of individuals), nonproblematic high-frequency pornography use (19-29% of individuals), and problematic high-frequency use (3-8% of individuals). Nonproblematic and problematic high-frequency-use groups showed differences in several constructs (ie, hypersexuality, depressive symptoms, boredom susceptibility, self-esteem, uncomfortable feelings regarding pornography, and basic psychological needs).FPU should not be considered as a sufficient or reliable indicator of PPU because the number of people with nonproblematic high-frequency use was 3-6 times higher than that with problematic high-frequency use. These results suggest that individuals with PPU use pornography frequently; however, FPU may not always be problematic.Self-report cross-sectional methods have possible biases that should be considered when interpreting findings (eg, underreporting or overreporting). However, the present research included 3 studies and involved large community samples and visitors of a pornography website. The present study is the first that empirically investigated pornography-use profiles with a wide range of correlates using both severity of PPU and FPU as profile indicators on specific and general samples.The present study is a first step in the differentiated examination of pornography-use profiles, taking into consideration both PPU and FPU, and it provides a foundation for further clinical and large-scale studies. Different psychological mechanisms may underlie the development and maintenance of FPU with or without PPU, suggesting different treatment approaches. Therefore, the present results may guide clinical work when considering reasons for seeking treatment for PPU. Bőthe B, Tóth-Király I, Potenza MN, et al.

We investigate this ‘drought paradox’ for the European Alps using a 1,212-station database and hyper-resolution ecohydrological simulations to quantify blue (runoff) and green (evapotranspiration) water fluxes. During the 2003 heatwave, evapotranspiration in large areas over the Alps was above average despite low precipitation, amplifying the runoff deficit by 32% in the most runoff-productive areas (1,300–3,000 m above sea level). A 3 °C air temperature increase could enhance annual evapotranspiration by up to 100 mm (45 mm on average), which would reduce annual runoff at a rate similar to a 3% precipitation decrease. This suggests that green-water feedbacks—which are often poorly represented in large-scale model simulations—pose an additional threat to water resources, especially in dry summers. Despite uncertainty in the validation of the hyper-resolution ecohydrological modelling with observations, this approach permits more realistic predictions of mountain region water availability. Mountain forest drought can paradoxically increase evapotranspiration (green water), helping vegetation at the expense of runoff (blue water).

Here, we comprehensively and transparently show that-in contrast to previous studies-end-of-century ocean acidification levels have negligible effects on important behaviours of coral reef fishes, such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators, fish activity levels and behavioural lateralization (left-right turning preference). Using data simulations, we additionally show that the large effect sizes and small within-group variances that have been reported in several previous studies are highly improbable.

We investigate the deep‐branching relationships among subfamilies of the Leguminosae (or Fabaceae), the third largest angiosperm family.

We resolve the deepest divergences in the legume phylogeny despite lack of phylogenetic signal across all chloroplast genes and the majority of nuclear genes. Strongly supported conflict in the remainder of nuclear genes is suggestive of incomplete lineage sorting.
All six subfamilies originated nearly simultaneously, suggesting that the prevailing view of some subfamilies as ‘basal’ or ‘early‐diverging’ with respect to others should be abandoned, which has important implications for understanding the evolution of legume diversity and traits.

We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices.

However, because the spatial resolution of existing land cover datasets is too coarse, large-scale land cover changes in the Arctic–Boreal region (ABR) have been poorly characterized. Here, we use 3 years (1984–2014) of moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite imagery over a region spanning 4.7 × 10 km2 in Alaska and northwestern Canada to characterize regional-scale ABR land cover changes.

This study examines the contribution of HRB and their effects on multisystem biological risk associated with morbidity and early mortality. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the links between HRB and AL. Twenty-six eligible human studies were included in our assessment of the current literature investigating the association of different HRB that included overeating/obesity, alcohol, smoking, drug use, physical inactivity and sleep impairments in relation to AL. We found that 5 % of obesity and substance abuse, 7 % of sleep and 62.5 % of combined HRB studies showed a significant association with AL. Lifestyle coping behaviours therefore have a significant contribution to AL. This study is among the first to explore multiple domains of HRB in relation to AL.

This heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, treatment, and the design and testing of new drugs. An important line of research is discovery of multimodal biomarkers that will facilitate the targeting of subpopulations with homogeneous pathophysiological signatures. High-throughput ‘omics’ are unbiased data-driven techniques that probe the complex aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease from multiple levels (e.g. network, cellular, and molecular) and thereby account for pathophysiological heterogeneity in clinical populations. This review focuses on data reduction analyses that identify complementary disease-relevant perturbations for three omics techniques: neuroimaging-based subtypes, metabolomics-derived metabolite panels, and genomics-related polygenic risk scores. Neuroimaging can track accrued neurodegeneration and other sources of network impairments, metabolomics provides a global small-molecule snapshot that is sensitive to ongoing pathological processes, and genomics characterizes relatively invariant genetic risk factors representing key pathways associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Following this focused review, we present a roadmap for assembling these multiomics measurements into a diagnostic tool highly predictive of individual clinical trajectories, to further the goal of personalized medicine in Alzheimer’s disease.",2020-05-01,Brain,https://openalex.org/V118357697,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz384,1315,1331,143,5,1,51,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2997092212,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz384,journal-article,2997092212

However, mechanistic knowledge of this reaction in an electrochemical context is still lacking and operando studies are even more rare. In this work, we utilize core-shell gold-metal oxide nanostructures which enable operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroelectrochemical studies to simultaneously visualize catalyst material transformation and surface reaction intermediates under an applied voltage. As a case study, we show how the transformation of NiOOH from ∼1-2 nm amorphous Ni layers facilitates the onset of HMF oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which is attained with 99% faradaic efficiency in 1 M KOH. In contrast to the case in 1 M KOH, NiOOH formation is suppressed, and consequently HMF oxidation is sluggish in 1 mM KOH, even at highly oxidizing potentials. Operando Raman experiments elucidate how surface adsorption and interaction dictates product selectivity and how the surface intermediates evolve with applied potential. We further extend our methodology to investigate NiFe, Co, Fe, and CoFe catalysts and demonstrate that high water oxidation activity is not necessarily correlated with excellent HMF oxidation performance and highlight catalytic factors important for this reaction such as reactant-surface interactions and the catalysts' physical and electronic structure.

In the absence of oxygen, the mitochondria of these organisms have lost all or parts of their genomes and evolved into mitochondria-related organelles (MROs). There has been debate regarding the presence of MROs in animals. Using deep sequencing approaches, we discovered that a member of the Cnidaria, the myxozoan Henneguya salminicola, has no mitochondrial genome, and thus has lost the ability to perform aerobic cellular respiration. This indicates that these core eukaryotic features are not ubiquitous among animals. Our analyses suggest that H. salminicola lost not only its mitochondrial genome but also nearly all nuclear genes involved in transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome. In contrast, we identified many genes that encode proteins involved in other mitochondrial pathways and determined that genes involved in aerobic respiration or mitochondrial DNA replication were either absent or present only as pseudogenes. As a control, we used the same sequencing and annotation methods to show that a closely related myxozoan, Myxobolus squamalis, has a mitochondrial genome. The molecular results are supported by fluorescence micrographs, which show the presence of mitochondrial DNA in M. squamalis, but not in H. salminicola. Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal. Hence, H. salminicola provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism.",2020-03-10,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://openalex.org/V125754415,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1909907117,5358,5363,117,10,1,47,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008736146,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1909907117,journal-article,3008736146

However, little is known about how these 2 peptides compare in heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, especially with contemporary assays. Both peptides were measured at screening in the PARADIGM-HF trial (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure). Methods: Eligibility criteria in PARADIGM-HF included New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, and elevated natriuretic peptides: BNP ≥15 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥60 pg/mL (for patients with HF hospitalization within 1 months, BNP ≥10 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥40 pg/mL). BNP and NT-proBNP were measured simultaneously at screening and only patients who fulfilled entry criteria for both natriuretic peptides were included in the present analysis. The BNP/NT-proBNP criteria were not different for patients in atrial fibrillation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min per 1.7 m 2 was a key exclusion criterion. Results: The median baseline concentration of NT-proBNP was 206 (Q1, Q3: 1217–4003) and BNP 31 (Q1, Q3: 207–559), and the ratio, calculated from the raw data, was ≈6.25:1. This ratio varied considerably according to rhythm (atrial fibrillation 8.03:1; no atrial fibrillation 5.75:1) and with age, renal function, and body mass index but not with left ventricular ejection fraction. Each peptide was similarly predictive of death (all-cause, cardiovascular, sudden and pump failure) and heart failure hospitalization, for example, cardiovascular death: BNP hazard ratio, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.33–1.49) per  SD increase, P &lt;0.0001; NT-proBNP, 1.4 (1.36–1.54); P &lt;0.0001. Conclusions: The ratio of NT-proBNP to BNP in heart failure and reduced ejection fraction appears to be greater than generally appreciated, differs between patients with and without atrial fibrillation, and increases substantially with increasing age and decreasing renal function.

(69%) of 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome received upfront therapy (14 haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and  chemotherapy),  (15%) patients received no treatment,  (8%) had unavailable data, and  (8%) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia before receiving treatment.  patients received treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia—including the two patients initially diagnosed with myelodysplastic who progressed— two (16%) received HSCT as initial therapy and ten (83%) received chemotherapy with intent to proceed with HSCT.  (92%) of 3 patients (eight of ten with leukaemia and  of 2 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were known to have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome before development of a myeloid malignancy and could have been monitored with bone marrow surveillance. Bone marrow surveillance before myeloid malignancy diagnosis was done in three (33%) of nine patients with leukaemia for whom surveillance status was confirmed and  (46%) of  patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients monitored had a 3-year overall survival of 62% (95% CI 32–82; n=14) compared with 28% (95% CI 10–50; n=19; p=0·13) without surveillance. Six (40%) of 15 patients with available longitudinal data developed myelodysplastic syndrome in the setting of stable blood counts. Interpretation Our results suggest that prognosis is poor for patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia owing to both therapy-resistant disease and treatment-related toxicities. Improved surveillance algorithms and risk stratification tools, studies of clonal evolution, and prospective trials are needed to inform effective prevention and treatment strategies for leukaemia predisposition in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.

Biofilm formation is regulated by 3',5'-cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) and requires production of the type IV mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pilus. Here, we show that the MSHA pilus is a dynamic extendable and retractable system, and its activity is directly controlled by c-di-GMP. The interaction between c-di-GMP and the ATPase MshE promotes pilus extension, whereas low levels of c-di-GMP correlate with enhanced retraction. Loss of retraction facilitated by the ATPase PilT increases near-surface roaming motility, and impairs initial surface attachment. However, prolonged retraction upon surface attachment results in reduced MSHA-mediated surface anchoring and increased levels of detachment. Our results indicate that c-di-GMP directly controls MshE activity, thus regulating MSHA pilus extension and retraction dynamics, and modulating V. cholerae surface attachment and colonization.",2020-03-25,Nature Communications,https://openalex.org/V64187185,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15331-8,,,11,1,1,40,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013886012,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15331-8,journal-article,3013886012

In this work, we study these challenges in the context of sequential supervised learning with an emphasis on recurrent neural networks. To evaluate the models in the lifelong learning setting, we propose a curriculum-based, simple, and intuitive benchmark where the models are trained on tasks with increasing levels of difficulty. To measure the impact of catastrophic forgetting, the model is tested on all the previous tasks as it completes any task. As a step toward developing true lifelong learning systems, we unify gradient episodic memory (a catastrophic forgetting alleviation approach) and Net2Net (a capacity expansion approach). Both models are proposed in the context of feedforward networks, and we evaluate the feasibility of using them for recurrent networks.

Cellular senescence, another means of responding to long-term cellular stress, has also been linked to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. Here, we evaluate the relationship between senescence and myofibroblast differentiation in the context of sustained autophagy. We analyzed markers of cell cycle arrest/senescence in fibroblasts in vitro, where autophagy was triggered by serum starvation (SS). Autophagic fibroblasts expressed the senescence biomarkers CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 and exhibited increased senescence-associated GLB1/beta-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of autophagy in serum-starved fibroblasts with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, or ATG7 (autophagy related 7) silencing prevented the expression of senescence-associated markers. Similarly, suppressing MTORC2 activation using rapamycin or by silencing RICTOR also prevented senescence hallmarks. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that senescence and myofibroblast differentiation were induced in different cells, suggesting mutually exclusive activation of senescence and myofibroblast differentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known inducers of senescence and exposing fibroblasts to ROS scavengers decreased ROS production during SS, inhibited autophagy, and significantly reduced the expression of senescence and myofibroblast differentiation markers. ROS scavengers also curbed the AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser473, an MTORC2 target, establishing the importance of ROS in fueling MTORC2 activation. Inhibition of senescence by shRNA to TP53/p53 and shRNA CDKN2A/p16 increased myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a negative feedback loop of senescence on autophagy-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Collectively, our results identify ROS as central inducers of MTORC2 activation during chronic autophagy, which in turn fuels senescence activation and myofibroblast differentiation in distinct cellular subpopulations.

The expression of the actin-associated protein cytosolic gelsolin (GSN) regulates the gynecological cancer cell fate resulting in dysregulation in chemosensitivity. In this study, we report that elevated expression of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a secreted isoform of GSN and expressed from the same GSN gene, correlates with poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients with OVCA. In addition, it is highly expressed and secreted in chemoresistant OVCA cells than its chemosensitive counterparts. pGSN, secreted and transported via exosomes (Ex-pGSN), upregulates HIF1α–mediated pGSN expression in chemoresistant OVCA cells in an autocrine manner as well as confers cisplatin resistance in otherwise chemosensitive OVCA cells. These findings support our hypothesis that exosomal pGSN promotes OVCA cell survival through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that transform chemosensitive cells to resistant counterparts.

Methods CCC underwent ProMisE (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer) classification identifying four molecular subtypes: i) ‘POLEmut’ for ECs with pathogenic POLE mutations, ii) ‘MMRd’, if there is loss of mismatch repair proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC), iii) ‘p53wt’ or iv) ‘p53abn’ based on p53 IHC staining. Clinicopathologic parameters, immune markers (CD3, CD8, CD79a, CD138, PD-1), ER, L1CAM, and outcomes were assessed. Results 5 CCCs were classified, including  (2%) POLEmut,  (10%) MMRd, 2 (54%) p53wt and 1 (35%) p53abn. Women with p53abn and p53wt CCCs were older than women with MMRd and POLEmut subtypes. p53wt CCC were distinct from typical p53wt endometrioid carcinomas; more likely to arise in older, thinner women, with advanced stage disease, LVSI and lymph node involvement, and a higher proportion ER negative, L1CAM overexpressing tumors with markedly worse outcomes. High levels of immune infiltrates (TILhigh) were observed in 75% of the CCC cohort. L1CAM overexpression was highest within p53abn and p53wt subtypes of CCC. Conclusion CCC is a heterogeneous disease encompassing all four molecular subtypes and a wide range of clinical outcomes. Outcomes of patients with POLEmut, MMRd and p53abn CCC are not distinguishable from those of other patients with these respective subtypes of EC; p53wt CCC, however, differ from endometrioid p53wt EC in clinical, pathological, molecular features and outcomes.

At the molecular level, the hormonal form of vitamin D signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed throughout the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The advent of genome-wide approaches to gene expression profiling have led to the identification of numerous VDR-regulated genes implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. The molecular data infer that vitamin D signaling should boost innate immunity against pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. Vitamin D signaling also suppresses inflammatory immune responses that underlie autoimmunity and regulate allergic responses. These findings have been bolstered by clinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmunity, and allergies. Our goals here are to provide an overview of the molecular basis for immune system regulation and to survey the clinical data from pediatric populations, using randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses where possible, linking vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of infections, autoimmune conditions, and allergies, and addressing the impact of supplementation on these conditions.",2020-04-27,Nutrients,https://openalex.org/V110785341,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051233,1233,1233,12,5,1,37,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3018352993,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051233,journal-article,3018352993

Biodiversity is a global issue where the challenge is to integrate all levels of biodiversity to ensure the long-term evolutionary potential and resilience of biological systems. Genetic approaches have largely contributed to biology by defining conservation entities accounting for their evolutionary history and adaptive potential, the so-called evolutionary significant units (ESUs). Yet, these approaches only loosely integrate the short-term ecological history of organisms. 2. Here, we argue that epigenetic variation, and more particularly DNA methylation, represents a molecular component of biodiversity that directly links the genome to the environment. As such, it provides the required information on the ecological background of organisms for an integrative field of biology. 3. We synthesize knowledge about the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in (a) orchestrating fundamental development alternatives in organisms, (b) enabling individuals to respond in real-time to selection pressures and (c) improving ecosystem stability and functioning. 4. Using practical examples in biology, we illustrate the relevance of DNA methylation (a) as biomarkers of past and present environmental stress events as well as biomarkers of physiological conditions of individuals; (b) for documenting the ecological structuring/clustering of wild populations and hence for better integrating ecology into ESUs; (c) for improving transloca-tions; and (d) for studying landscape functional connectivity. 5.

Frailty, characterized by loss of homeostatic reserves and increased vulnerability to physiological decompensation, results from an aggregation of insults across multiple organ systems. Frailty can be quantified by counting the number of ‘health deficits’ across a range of domains. We assessed the frequency of, and outcomes related to, frailty in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods and results: 
Using a cumulative deficits approach, we constructed a 42‐item frailty index (FI) and applied it to identify frail patients enrolled in two HFrEF trials (PARADIGM‐HF and ATMOSPHERE). In keeping with previous studies, patients with FI ≤0.210 were classified as non‐frail and those with higher scores were divided into two categories using score increments of 0.100. Clinical outcomes were examined, adjusting for prognostic variables. Among 13 625 participants, mean (± standard deviation) FI was 0.250 (0.10) and 838 patients (63%) were frail (FI >0.210). The frailest patients were older and had more symptoms and signs of heart failure. Women were frailer than men. All outcomes were worse in the frailest, with high rates of all‐cause death or all‐cause hospitalization: 40.7 (39.1–42.4) vs. 22.1 (21.2–23.0) per 100 person‐years in the non‐frail; adjusted hazard ratio 1.63 (1.53–1.75) (P < 0.001). The rate of all‐cause hospitalizations, taking account of recurrences, was 61.5 (59.8–63.1) vs. 31.2 (30.3–32.2) per 100 person‐years (incidence rate ratio 1.76; 1.62–1.90; P < 0.001).

Aims The aim of the present work was to develop a scale (Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale–CSBD-19) that can reliably and validly assess CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Method Four independent samples of 9,325 individuals completed self-reported measures from three countries (the United States, Hungary, and Germany). The psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 were examined in terms of factor structure, reliability, measurement invariance, and theoretically relevant correlates. A potential threshold was determined to identify individuals with an elevated risk of CSBD. Results The five-factor model of the CSBD-19 (i.e., control, salience, relapse, dissatisfaction, and negative consequences) had an excellent fit to the data and demonstrated appropriate associations with the correlates. Measurement invariance suggested that the CSBD-19 functions similarly across languages. Men had higher means than women. A score of 50 points was found as an optimal threshold to identify individuals at high-risk of CSBD.

Specifically, alongside cancellation and postponements of non-essential surgical services, emergency and essential surgical care delivery may become affected due to the shift of human and material resources towards fighting the pandemic. For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity in LMIC surgical ecosystems may result in higher morbidity and mortality, in addition to the COVID-19 toll. This paper aims to explore the potential consequences of COVID-19 on the emergency and essential surgical care in LMICs, to offer recommendations to mitigate damages and to reflect on preparedness for future crises. Reducing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMIC emergency and essential surgical services can be achieved through empowering communities with accurate information and knowledge on prevention, optimizing surgical material resources, providing quality training of health care personnel to treat SARS-CoV-2, and ensuring adequate personal protection equipment for workers on the frontline.

While it is well established that ICU-acquired weakness severely impairs long-term prognosis, the association of diaphragm dysfunction with this outcome has never been reported. This study investigated whether diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative long-term outcomes and whether the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness has a particular association with 2-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods This study is an ancillary study derived from an observational cohort study. Patients under mechanical ventilation were enrolled at the time of their first spontaneous breathing trial. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined by tracheal pressure generated by phrenic nerve stimulation &lt; 1 cmH  O and ICU-acquired weakness was defined by Medical Research Council (MRC) score &lt; 48. HRQOL was evaluated with the SF-36 questionnaire. Results Sixty-nine of the 7 patients enrolled in the original study were included in the survival analysis and 4 were interviewed. Overall 2-year survival was 67% (46/69): 64% (29/45) in patients with diaphragm dysfunction, 71% (17/24) in patients without diaphragm dysfunction, 46% (11/24) in patients with ICU-acquired weakness and 76% (34/45) in patients without ICU-acquired weakness. Patients with concomitant diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness had a poorer outcome with a 2-year survival rate of 36% (5/14) compared to patients without diaphragm function and ICU-acquired weakness [79% (11/14) ( p &lt; 0.01)]. Health-related quality of life was not influenced by the presence of ICU-acquired weakness, diaphragm dysfunction or their coexistence.

This nationally-representative survey, launched in 200 by the Government of Canada, has measured over 25 chemicals in approximately 30,000 Canadians during the last decade. The capacity to interpret these data at the population level in a health risk context is gradually improving with the development of biomonitoring screening values, such as biomonitoring equivalents (BE) and human biomonitoring (HBM) values. This study evaluates recent population level biomonitoring data from the CHMS in a health risk context using biomonitoring screening values. Nationally representative biomonitoring data for fluoride, selenium, molybdenum, arsenic, silver, thallium, cyfluthrin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, bisphenol A, triclosan, acrylamide, cadmium, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), bromoform, chloroform, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene and tetrachloroethylene were screened as part as this study. For non-cancer endpoints, hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated as the ratio of population level concentrations of a specific chemical at the geometric mean and 95th percentile to the corresponding biomonitoring screening value. Cancer risks were calculated at the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the population concentration using BEs based on a risk specific dose. Most of the chemicals analyzed had HQs below 1 suggesting that levels of exposure to these chemicals are not a concern at the population level. However, HQs exceeded 1 in smokers for cadmium, acrylamide and benzene, as well as in the general population for inorganic arsenic, PFOS and PFOA, 3-PBA and fluoride. Furthermore, cancer risks for inorganic arsenic, acrylamide, and benzene at most population percentiles of exposure were elevated (>10-5). Specifically, for inorganic arsenic in the general population, the HQ was 3.1 at the 95th percentile concentration and the cancer risk was 3. × 10-4 at the 50th percentile of population concentrations. These results suggest that the levels of exposure in the Canadian population to some of the environmental chemicals assessed might be of concern. The results of this screening exercise support the findings of previous risk assessments and ongoing efforts to reduce risks from exposure to chemicals evaluated as part of this study. Although paucity of biomonitoring screening values for several environmental contaminants may be a limitation to this approach, our assessment contributes to the prioritization of a number of chemicals measured as part of CHMS for follow-up activities such as more detailed characterization of exposure sources.",2020-01-01,International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health,https://openalex.org/V83450999,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.07.009,267,280,223,1,1,31,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2973037307,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.07.009,journal-article,2973037307

Like all the GTPases, Ran cycles between an active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) state. However, Ran lacks the CAAX motif at its C-terminus, a feature of other small GTPases that ensures a plasma membrane localization, and largely traffics between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Ran regulates nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of molecules through the nuclear pore complex and controls cell cycle progression through the regulation of microtubule polymerization and mitotic spindle formation. The disruption of Ran expression has been linked to cancer at different levels - from cancer initiation to metastasis. In the present review, we discuss the contribution of Ran in the acquisition of three hallmarks of cancer, namely, proliferative signaling, resistance to apoptosis, and invasion/metastasis, and highlight its prognostic value in cancer patients.

However, most patients are still not cured, underscoring the need for improved treatments and the possible development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for improved immunotherapy. We previously showed that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β is a central regulator of PD-1 expression, where GSK-3 inhibition down-regulates PD-1 and enhances CD8+ cytolytic T cell (CTL) function, reducing viral infections and tumor growth. Here, we demonstrate that GSK-3 also negatively regulates Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 (LAG-3) expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. GSK-3 SMIs are more effective than LAG-3 blockade alone in suppressing B1 melanoma growth, while their combination resulted in enhanced tumor clearance. This was linked to increased expression of the transcription factor, Tbet, which bound the LAG-3 promoter, inhibiting its transcription, and to increased granzyme  and interferon-γ1 expression.

Laboratory evidence suggests that community rescue is most likely in high-biomass communities that have previously experienced moderate doses of sublethal stress. We assessed this result under more natural conditions, in a mesocosm experiment with phytoplankton communities exposed to the ubiquitous herbicide glyphosate. We tested whether community biomass and prior herbicide exposure would facilitate community rescue after severe contamination. We found that prior exposure to glyphosate was a very strong predictor of the rescue outcome, while high community biomass was not. Furthermore, although glyphosate had negative effects on diversity, it did not influence community composition significantly, suggesting a modest role for genus sorting in this rescue process. Our results expand the scope of community rescue theory to complex ecosystems and confirm that prior stress exposure is a key predictor of rescue.",2020-03-02,Nature Ecology and Evolution,https://openalex.org/V2764884935,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1134-5,578,588,4,4,1,29,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010611913,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1134-5,journal-article,3010611913

Here we used quantitative SUMO proteomics to identify potential substrates of PIAS1 in a system-wide manner. We identified 98 SUMO sites on 54 proteins, of which 6 proteins were assigned as putative PIAS1 substrates. In particular, vimentin (VIM), a type III intermediate filament protein involved in cytoskeleton organization and cell motility, was SUMOylated by PIAS1 at Lys-43 and Lys-44 residues. VIM SUMOylation was necessary for its dynamic disassembly and cells expressing a non-SUMOylatable VIM mutant showed a reduced level of migration.

HD 9765 is one of the brightest stars hosting a planet of this kind, and we present the transmission spectrum of this planet by combining four HST transits, twelve Spitzer/IRAC transits, and eight MOST transits of this system. Our transmission spectrum has higher signal to noise ratio than that from previous works, and the result suggests that the slight increase in transit depth from wavelength 1. to 1. microns reported in previous works on the transmission spectrum of this planet is likely systematic. Nonetheless, our atmospheric modeling results are not conclusive as no model provides an excellent match to our data. Nonetheless we find that atmospheres with high C/O ratios (C/O >~ 0.8) and metallicities of >~ 100x solar metallicity are favored. We combine the mid-transit times from all the new Spitzer and MOST observations and obtain an updated orbital period of P=9.489295 +/- 0.00000 d, with a best-fit transit time center at T_0 = 2456361.80690 +/- 0.0003 (BJD).

Similarly, female rats can show more incentive motivation for cocaine than male rats do. Most preclinical studies on this issue have used self-administration procedures that provide continuous cocaine access during each session (long-access or LgA and short-access). However, intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration better models the intermittency of human cocaine use. Here, we compared cocaine use in female and male rats that received ten, daily 6-hour LgA or IntA sessions. Cocaine intake was greatest under LgA, and female LgA rats escalated their intake. Only IntA rats (both sexes) developed locomotor sensitization to self-administered cocaine, and sensitization was greatest in females. Five and 25 days after the last self-administration session, we quantified responding for cocaine (0.083-0.75 mg/kg/infusion) under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule, a measure of motivation for drug. Across conditions, females earned more cocaine infusions than males under the PR schedule. Across sexes, IntA rats earned more infusions than LgA rats, even though IntA rats had previously taken much less cocaine. Cumulative cocaine intake significantly predicted responding for cocaine under the PR schedule in male LgA rats only. In IntA rats, the extent of locomotor sensitization significantly predicted responding under the PR schedule. Thus, LgA might be appropriate to study sex differences in cocaine intake, whereas IntA might be best suited to study sex differences in sensitization-related neuroadaptations involved in cocaine addiction.

A semantic analysis was performed to compare the strength of similar recommendations based on their formulation. The recommendations were categorized in a standardized manner considering the following  levels: ""essential,"" ""recommended,"" ""may be recommended,"" and ""not recommended.""Methodological quality was considered high for 3 CPGs and low for 6. All CPGs recommended active treatment modalities, such as an exercise program in the management of rotator cuff disorders. Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prescriptions and corticosteroid injections were presented as modalities that may be recommended to decrease pain. Recommendations related to medical imagery and surgical opinion varied among the guidelines.

However, this requires a thorough knowledge of their toxicokinetics. The time courses of BPS and BPSG were assessed in accessible biological matrices of orally and dermally exposed volunteers. Under the approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Montreal, six volunteers were orally exposed to a BPS-d8 deuterated dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight (bw). One month later,  mg/kg bw of BPS-d8 were applied on 4 cm2 of the forearm and then washed  h after application. Blood samples were taken prior to dosing and at fixed time periods over 48 h after treatment; complete urine voids were collected pre-exposure and at pre-established intervals over 7 h postdosing. Following oral exposure, the plasma concentration-time courses of BPS-d8 and BPSG-d8 over 48 h evolved in parallel, and showed a rapid appearance and elimination. Average peak values (±SD) were reached at 0. ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0. h postdosing and mean (±SD) apparent elimination half-lives (t½) of 7. ± 1.1 and 9.3 ± 7. h were calculated from the terminal phase of BPS-d8 and BPSG-d8 in plasma, respectively. The fraction of BPS-d8 reaching the systemic circulation unchanged (i.e. bioavailability) was further estimated at 6 ± 5% on average (±SD) and the systemic plasma clearance at 0.5 ± 0.0 L/kg bw/h. Plasma concentration-time courses and urinary excretion rate profiles roughly evolved in parallel for both substances, as expected. The average percent (±SD) of the administered dose recovered in urine as BPS-d8 and BPSG-d8 over the 0-72 h period postdosing was 1.7 ± 1. and 5 ± 10%. Following dermal application, plasma levels were under the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at most time points. However, peak values were reached between 5 and  h depending on individuals, suggesting a slower absorption rate compared to oral exposure. Similarly, limited amounts of BPS-d8 and its conjugate were recovered in urine and peak excretion rates were reached between  and  h postdosing. The average percent (±SD) of the administered dose recovered in urine as BPS-d8 and BPSG-d8 was about 0.00 ± 0.00 and 0.0 ± 0.07%, respectively. This study provided greater precision on the kinetics of this contaminant in humans and, in particular, evidenced major differences between BPA and BPS kinetics with much higher systemic levels of active BPS than BPA, an observation explained by a higher oral bioavailability of BPS than BPA.

In pathological conditions, mitochondrial stress leads to neuronal death, which is regulated by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein localized to mitochondria either in the outer membrane (OM) or inner membrane (Matrix), which have distinct roles in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting bioenergetics, respectively. While the anti-apoptotic role for Mcl1 is well characterized, the protective function of MCL-1 Matrix remains poorly understood. Here, we show MCL-1 OM and MCL-1 Matrix prevent neuronal death through distinct mechanisms. We report that MCL-1 Matrix functions to preserve mitochondrial energy transduction and improves respiratory chain capacity by modulating mitochondrial oxygen consumption in response to mitochondrial stress. We show that MCL-1 Matrix protects neurons from stress by enhancing respiratory function, and by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Taken together, our results provide novel insight into how MCL-1 Matrix may confer neuroprotection under stress conditions involving loss of mitochondrial function.",2020-05-05,Cell Death and Disease,https://openalex.org/V185208586,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2498-9,,,11,5,1,26,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022457072,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2498-9,journal-article,3022457072

Imbalances in the extension space, flexion space, medial compartment and lateral compartment were calculated.Extension space imbalances (≥ 3 mm) occurred in 25% of varus and 54% of valgus knees and severe imbalances (≥  mm) were present in up to 8% of varus and 19% of valgus knees. Higher flexion space imbalance rates were created with TEA versus PC (p < 0.001). Using TEA, only 49% of varus and 18% of valgus knees had < 3 mm of imbalance throughout the extension and flexion spaces, and medial and lateral compartments.A systematic use of the simulated measured resection MA technique for TKA leads to many cases with imbalance.

Objective To present the QPN and to perform preliminary analysis of the QPN data. Methods A total of 1,070 consecutively recruited PD patients were included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed, including comparisons between males and females, PD patients with and without RBD, and stratified analyses comparing early and late-onset PD and different age groups. Results QPN patients exhibit a male:female ratio of 1.8:1, an average age-at-onset of 58.6 years, an age-at-diagnosis of 60.4 years, and average disease duration of 8.9 years. REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was more common among men, and RBD was associated with other motor and non-motor symptoms including dyskinesia, fluctuations, postural hypotension and hallucinations. Older patients had significantly higher rates of constipation and cognitive impairment, and longer disease duration was associated with higher rates of dyskinesia, fluctuations, freezing of gait, falls, hallucinations and cognitive impairment.

Water infiltration and subsurface water flow under an embankment affect the energy balance of roadways and underlying permafrost. However, the quantification of the processes controlling these changes and a detailed investigation of their thermal impacts remain largely unknown due to a lack of available long‐term embankment temperature data in permafrost regions. Here, we report observations of heat advection linked to surface water infiltration and subsurface flow based on a 9‐year (from 2009 to 2017) thermal monitoring at an experimental road test site built on ice‐rich permafrost conditions in southwestern Yukon, Canada. Our results show that snowmelt water infiltration in the spring rapidly increases temperature in the upper portion of the embankment. The earlier disappearance of snow deposited at the embankment slope increases the thawing period and the temperature gradient in the embankment compared with the natural ground. Infiltrated summer rainfall water lowered the near‐surface temperatures and subsequently warmed embankment fill materials down to 3.6‐m depth. Heat advection caused by the flow of subsurface water produced warming rates at depth in the embankment subgrade up to two orders of magnitude faster than by atmospheric warming (heat conduction). Subsurface water flow promoted permafrost thawing under the road embankment and led to an increase in active layer thickness. We conclude that the thermal stability of roadways along the Alaska Highway corridor is not maintainable in situations where water is flowing under the infrastructure unless mitigation techniques are used.

To date, such studies have largely focused on animals, fungi, and land plants (primarily multicellular eukaryotes); relatively few mitochondrial proteomes from protists (primarily unicellular eukaryotic microbes) have been examined. To gauge the full extent of mitochondrial structural and functional complexity and to identify potential evolutionary trends in mitochondrial proteomes, more comprehensive explorations of phylogenetically diverse mitochondrial proteomes are required. In this regard, a key group is the jakobids, a clade of protists belonging to the eukaryotic supergroup Discoba, distinguished by having the most gene-rich and most bacteria-like mitochondrial genomes discovered to date. Results In this study, we assembled the draft nuclear genome sequence for the jakobid Andalucia godoyi and used a comprehensive in silico approach to infer the nucleus-encoded portion of the mitochondrial proteome of this protist, identifying 864 candidate mitochondrial proteins. The A. godoyi mitochondrial proteome has a complexity that parallels that of other eukaryotes, while exhibiting an unusually large number of ancestral features that have been lost particularly in opisthokont (animal and fungal) mitochondria. Notably, we find no evidence that the A. godoyi nuclear genome has or had a gene encoding a single-subunit, T3/T7 bacteriophage-like RNA polymerase, which functions as the mitochondrial transcriptase in all eukaryotes except the jakobids. Conclusions As genome and mitochondrial proteome data have become more widely available, a strikingly punctuate phylogenetic distribution of different mitochondrial components has been revealed, emphasizing that the pathways of mitochondrial proteome evolution are likely complex and lineage-specific. Unraveling this complexity will require comprehensive comparative analyses of mitochondrial proteomes from a phylogenetically broad range of eukaryotes, especially protists.

Here, we used complementary in situ measurements, model simulations, and satellite observations to investigate the net carbon dioxide (CO2 ) seasonal cycle and its climatic and environmental controls across Alaska and northwestern Canada during the anomalously warm winter to spring conditions of 201 and 201 (relative to 2010-2014). In the warm spring, we found that photosynthesis was enhanced more than respiration, leading to greater CO2 uptake. However, photosynthetic enhancement from spring warming was partially offset by greater ecosystem respiration during the preceding anomalously warm winter, resulting in nearly neutral effects on the annual net CO2 balance. Eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements showed that air temperature has a primary influence on net CO2 exchange in winter and spring, while soil moisture has a primary control on net CO2 exchange in the fall. The net CO2 exchange was generally more moisture limited in the boreal region than in the Arctic tundra. Our analysis indicates complex seasonal interactions of underlying C cycle processes in response to changing climate and hydrology that may not manifest in changes in net annual CO2 exchange.

Our primary aim was to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between pharmacological cardioversion followed by electrical cardioversion (drug–shock), and electrical cardioversion alone (shock-only). Our secondary aim was to compare the effectiveness of two pad positions for electrical cardioversion. Methods We did a partial factorial trial of two protocols for patients with acute atrial fibrillation at 1 academic hospital emergency departments in Canada. We enrolled adult patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Protocol 1 was a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled comparison of attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide (1 mg/kg over 30 min) followed by electrical cardioversion if necessary (up to three shocks, each of ≥200 J), and placebo infusion followed by electrical cardioversion. For patients having electrical cardioversion, we used Protocol 2, a randomised, open-label, nested comparison of anteroposterior versus anterolateral pad positions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by study site) for Protocol 1 by on-site research personnel using an online electronic data capture system. Randomisation for Protocol 2 occurred 30 min after drug infusion for patients who had not converted and was stratified by site and Protocol 1 allocation. Patients and all research and emergency department staff were masked to treatment allocation for Protocol 1. The primary outcome was conversion to normal sinus rhythm for at least 30 min at any time after randomisation and up to a point immediately after three shocks. Protocol 1 was analysed by intention to treat and Protocol  excluded patients who did not receive electrical cardioversion. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891058. Findings Between July 18, 2013, and Oct 17, 2018, we enrolled 3 patients, and none were lost to follow-up. In the drug–shock group (n=204), conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 1 (96%) patients and in the shock-only group (n=192), conversion occurred in 1 (92%) patients (absolute difference 4%; 95% CI 0–9; p=0·07). The proportion of patients discharged home was 97% (n=198) versus 95% (n=183; p=0·60). 1 (52%) patients in the drug–shock group converted after drug infusion only. No patients had serious adverse events in follow-up. The different pad positions in Protocol  (n=244), had similar conversions to sinus rhythm (11 [94%] of 1 in anterolateral group vs 1 [92%] of 1 in anteroposterior group; p=0·68). Interpretation Both the drug–shock and shock-only strategies were highly effective, rapid, and safe in restoring sinus rhythm for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation, avoiding the need for return to hospital. The drug infusion worked for about half of patients and avoided the resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion.

However, efforts to encourage implementation of deprescribing in clinical practice have resulted in mixed results across settings and countries.Area covered: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar in June 2019. Reference lists, citation checking, and personal reference libraries were also utilized. Studies capturing the main challenges of, and opportunities for, implementing deprescribing into clinical practice across selected health-care settings internationally, and international deprescribing-orientated policies were included and summarized in this narrative review.Expert opinion: Deprescribing intervention studies are inherently heterogeneous because of the complexity of interventions employed and often do not reflect the real-world. Further research investigating enhanced implementation of deprescribing into clinical practice and across health-care settings is required. Process evaluations in deprescribing intervention studies are needed to determine the contextual factors that are important to the translation of the interventions in the real-world. Deprescribing interventions may need to be individually tailored to target the unique barriers and opportunities to deprescribing in different clinical settings.

However, it is unclear how such models can explain situations, often encountered during natural behavior, in which we make decisions while were are already engaged in performing an action. Does the process of deliberation characterized in classical studies of decision-making proceed the same way when subjects are deciding while already acting? In the present study, human subjects continuously tracked a target moving in the horizontal plane and were occasionally presented with a new target to which they could freely choose to switch at any time, whereupon it became the new tracked target. We found that the probability of choosing to switch increased with decreasing distance to the new target and increasing size of the new target relative to the tracked target, as well as when the direction to the new target was aligned (either toward or opposite) to the current tracking direction. However, contrary to our expectations, subjects did not choose targets that minimized the energetic costs of execution, as calculated by a biomechanical model of the arm. When the constraints of continuous tracking were removed in variants of the task involving point-to-point movements, the expected preference for lower cost choices was seen. These results are discussed in the context of current theories of nested feedback control, internal models of forward dynamics, and high-dimensional neural spaces. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Current theories of decision-making primarily address how subjects make decisions before executing selected actions. However, in our daily lives we often make decisions while already performing some action (e.g., while playing a sport or navigating through a crowd). To gain insight into how current theories can be extended to such “decide-while-acting” scenarios, we examined human decisions during continuous manual tracking and found some intriguing departures from how decisions are made in classical “decide-then-act” paradigms.",2020-02-12,Journal of Neurophysiology,https://openalex.org/V142952003,American Physiological Society,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00613.2019,1090,1102,123,3,1,22,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006469780,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00613.2019,journal-article,3006469780

TOM abilities have been consistently linked to markers of social adaptation and have been shown to be affected in a broad range of clinical conditions. Despite the wealth and breadth of research dedicated to TOM, identifying appropriate assessment tools for young children remains challenging. This systematic review presents an inventory of TOM measures for children aged 0-5 years and provides details on their content and characteristics. Electronic databases (1983-2019) and  test publisher catalogs were systematically reviewed. In total, 22 measures, identified within 83 studies, were found to assess the understanding of seven categories of mental states and social situations: emotions, desires, intentions, percepts, knowledge, beliefs and mentalistic understanding of non-literal communication, and pertained to 3 types of TOM sub-abilities. Information on the measures' mode of presentation, number of items, scoring options, and target populations were extracted, and psychometric details are listed in summary tables. The results of the systematic review are summarized in a visual framework ""Abilities in Theory of Mind Space"" (ATOMS) which provides a new taxonomy of TOM sub-domains.

Methods Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a prospective birth cohort of 2,120 individuals followed from birth (1997/98) to age 17 years (2014/15). Cybervictimization and face-to-face victimization experienced since the beginning of the school year, as well as serious suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt were self-reported at ages 13, 15 and 17 years. Results In cross-sectional analyses at 13, 15 and 17 years, adolescents cybervictimized at least once had, respectively, 2.3 (95% CI = 1.64-3.19), 4.2 (95% CI = 3.27-5.41) and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.57-4.66) higher odds of suicidal ideation/attempt after adjusting for confounders including face-to-face victimization, prior mental health symptoms and family hardship. Sensitivity analyses suggested that cybervictimization only and both cyber- and face-to-face victimization were associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation/attempt compared to face-to-face victimization only and no victimization; however, analyses were based on small n. In prospective analyses, cybervictimization was not associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later after accounting for baseline suicidal ideation/attempt and other confounders. In contrast, face-to-face victimization was associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later in the fully adjusted model, including cybervictimization.

It is important to know what a given total score or a change score from baseline on one scale means in relation to the other scale. Methods We obtained individual participant data from the randomised controlled trials of psychological and pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorders. We then identified corresponding scores of the HAMD and the BDI (36 patients from seven trials) or the BDI-II (68 patients from another seven trials) using the equipercentile linking method. Results The HAMD total scores of 10, 2 and 3 corresponded approximately with the BDI scores of 10, 2 and 4 or with the BDI-II scores of 13, 3 and 50. The HAMD change scores of −2 and −1 with the BDI of −2 and −1 and with the BDI-II of −3 and −16.

This raises the question if BIEX can be integrated into a full-scale drinking water treatment plant to remove NOM and ammonia. In this study, a pilot plant consisting of one BIEX filter, three GAC filters and one BAC filter was set up as second-stage filtration at the Sainte-Rose drinking water treatment plant (Laval, Canada). The pilot plant was operated for a period of nine months without regeneration of the ion exchange resins. The influent water showed low DOC (2.5 mg/L) and high sulfate concentrations (28.2 mg/L). Except of a short peak of DOC released at about  000 BV, the BIEX filter achieved a nearly constant removal of 29-36% over the whole study period. The DOC removals of GAC were similar to BIEX at < 800 BV but then stabilized at 13-24% after  000 BV. Most DOC removal in the BIEX filter was achieved at the top 3 cm layer (81%) compared to 62-66% removal in the GAC/BAC filters in the same layer. After the rapid exhaustion of the primary ion exchange capacity (<1 000 BV), sulfate displaced the fraction of NOM with lower affinity than sulfate, corresponding to the initial DOC release in the BIEX filter. The fraction of NOM with higher affinity than sulfate can still replace sulfate, which explains the good long-term performance of the BIEX filter. BIEX released ammonia with an average of 15% in warm water condition, probably related to the small diameter of the column which limited backwash effectiveness.",2020-01-01,Water Research,https://openalex.org/V52566953,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115148,115148,115148,168,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2978176403,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.115148,journal-article,2978176403

Although contaminated sites are environmentally damaging, high economic costs often discourage soil remediation efforts. Phytoremediation is a potential green technology solution but can be challenging due to the diversity of anthropogenic contaminants. Co-cropping could provide improved tolerance to diverse soil challenges by taking advantage of distinct crop capabilities. Co-cropping of three species with potentially complementary functions, Festuca arundinacea, Salix miyabeana and Medicago sativa, perform well on diversely contaminated soils. Here, rhizosphere microbiomes of each crop in monoculture and in all co-cropping combinations were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing and differential abundance analysis. The hyperaccumulating F. arundinacea rhizosphere microbiome included putative plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) and metal tolerance species, such as Rhizorhapis suberifaciens, Cellvibrio fibrivorans and Pseudomonas lini. The rhizosphere microbiome of the fast-growing tree S. miyabeana included diverse taxa involved in POP degradation, including the species Phenylobacterium panacis. The well-characterised nitrogen-fixing M. sativa microbiome species, Sinorhizobium meliloti, was identified alongside others involved in nutrient acquisition and putative yet-to-be-cultured Candidatus saccharibacteria (TM7-1 group). The majority of differentially abundant rhizosphere-associated bacterial species were maintained in co-cropping pairs, with pairs having higher numbers of differentially abundant taxa than monocultures in all cases. This was not the case when all three crops were co-cropped, where most host-specific bacterial species were not detected as differentially abundant, indicating the potential for reduced rhizosphere functionality. The crops cultivated in pairs here retained rhizosphere microbiome bacteria involved in these monoculture ecosystem services of plant growth promotion, POP tolerance and degradation, and improved nutrient acquisition. These findings provide a promising outlook of the potential for complementary co-cropping strategies for phytoremediation of the multifaceted anthropogenic pollution which can disastrously affect soils around the world.",2020-04-01,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135067,135067,135067,711,,0,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2991398117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135067,journal-article,2991398117

Due to the high affinity between heparin and PDDA, the present senor shows good analytical performance with respect to heparin detection. Two obvious advantages of the proposed heparin sensor over other reported methods are: its much wider linear concentration range (10-6-10-10 g/mL) and lower limit of detection (0.0257 ng/mL). The analysis of heparin in serum demonstrated that the present sensor exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity.

HIV persists preferentially in CD4+ T cells expressing multiple immune checkpoint (IC) molecules, including programmed death (PD)-1, T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte associated gene 3 (LAG-3), and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). We aimed to determine whether these and other IC molecules have a functional role in maintaining HIV latency and whether blocking IC molecules with Abs reverses HIV latency. Using an in vitro model that establishes latency in both nonproliferating and proliferating human CD4+ T cells, we show that proliferating cells express multiple IC molecules at high levels. Latent infection was enriched in proliferating cells expressing PD-1. In contrast, nonproliferating cells expressed IC molecules at significantly lower levels, but latent infection was enriched in cells expressing PD-1, TIM-3, CTL-associated protein  (CTLA-4), or B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). In the presence of an additional T cell-activating stimulus, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, Abs to CTLA-4 and PD-1 reversed HIV latency in proliferating and nonproliferating CD4+ T cells, respectively. In the absence of staphylococcal enterotoxin B, only the combination of Abs to PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and TIGIT reversed latency.

We analyzed 10 healthy young adults (ages 18–29) born preterm (≤29 weeks of gestation) and 10 full-term controls, predominantly (90%) white. They underwent a comprehensive clinical and biological evaluation, including measurement of blood pressure, lung function (spirometry), glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and oral glucose tolerance test), as well as biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Individuals born preterm were at higher risk than those born full-term of stage ≥1 hypertension (adjusted odds ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.51–5.75]), glucose intolerance (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.13–4.48]), and airflow limitation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.47 [95% CI, 1.76–7.12]).

Recent efforts demonstrating variance in functional brain organization within and between individuals shows a need for improving reproducibility of functional parcellations without long scan times. We apply bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, to the problem of improving reproducibility in functional parcellation. We use two large datasets to demonstrate that compared to a standard clustering framework, bagging improves the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of both cortical and subcortical functional parcellations across a range of sites, scanners, samples, scan lengths, clustering algorithms, and clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters, spatial constraints). With as little as 6 ​min of scan time, bagging creates more reproducible group and individual level parcellations than standard approaches with twice as much data. This suggests that regardless of the specific parcellation strategy employed, bagging may be a key method for improving functional parcellation and bringing functional neuroimaging-based measurement closer to clinical impact.",2020-02-29,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116678,116678,116678,214,,1,20,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008960459,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116678,journal-article,3008960459

Although lymph is utilized by leukocytes for immune surveillance, it remains inaccessible to platelets and erythrocytes. Activated cells release submicron extracellular vesicles (EV) that transport molecules from the donor cell. In rheumatoid arthritis, EV accumulate in the joint where they can interact with numerous cellular lineages. However, whether EV can exit the inflamed tissue to recirculate is unknown. Here, we investigated whether vascular leakage that occurs during inflammation could favor EV access to the lymphatic system. Approach and Results: Using an in vivo model of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, we show that there is an influx of platelet EV, but not EV from erythrocytes or leukocytes, in joint-draining lymph. In contrast to blood platelet EV, lymph platelet EV lacked mitochondrial organelles and failed to promote coagulation. Platelet EV influx in lymph was consistent with joint vascular leakage and implicated the fibrinogen receptor α2bβ 3 and platelet-derived serotonin.

However, in order to translate improved diagnostics to personalised treatments, there is an urgent need to link molecular pathophysiology in epilepsy to whole-brain dynamics in seizures. Zebrafish have emerged as a promising new animal model for epileptic seizure disorders, with particular relevance for genetic and developmental epilepsies. As a novel model organism for epilepsy research they combine key advantages: the small size of larval zebrafish allows high throughput in vivo experiments; the availability of advanced genetic tools allows targeted modification to model specific human genetic disorders (including genetic epilepsies) in a vertebrate system; and optical access to the entire central nervous system has provided the basis for advanced microscopy technologies to image structure and function in the intact larval zebrafish brain. There is a growing body of literature describing and characterising features of epileptic seizures and epilepsy in larval zebrafish. Recently genetically encoded calcium indicators have been used to investigate the neurobiological basis of these seizures with light microscopy. This approach offers a unique window into the multiscale dynamics of epileptic seizures, capturing both whole-brain dynamics and single-cell behaviour concurrently. At the same time, linking observations made using calcium imaging in the larval zebrafish brain back to an understanding of epileptic seizures largely derived from cortical electrophysiological recordings in human patients and mammalian animal models is non-trivial. In this review we briefly illustrate the state of the art of epilepsy research in zebrafish with particular focus on calcium imaging of epileptic seizures in the larval zebrafish. We illustrate the utility of a dynamic systems perspective on the epileptic brain for providing a principled approach to linking observations across species and identifying those features of brain dynamics that are most relevant to epilepsy. In the following section we survey the literature for imaging features associated with epilepsy and epileptic seizures and link these to observations made from humans and other more traditional animal models. We conclude by identifying the key challenges still facing epilepsy research in the larval zebrafish and indicate strategies for future research to address these and integrate more directly with the themes and questions that emerge from investigating epilepsy in other model systems and human patients.",2020-01-14,European Journal of Paediatric Neurology,https://openalex.org/V30097070,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2020.01.006,70,80,24,,1,19,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000185559,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2020.01.006,journal-article,3000185559

This review aimed at providing a synthesis of population pharmacokinetic models of vancomycin in adults, determining the most reported pharmacokinetic models, and identifying various sources of variability in different special subpopulations to better inform vancomycin dosing. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for population pharmacokinetic studies of vancomycin published from January 201 to May 2019. Inspection of the relevant lists of references was conducted, as well. This search resulted in a total of 3 eligible studies, which were included. One-, two-, and three-compartments models were reported to best describe vancomycin population pharmacokinetics in 13, 14, and  studies, respectively. Three-compartment models were implemented in three studies to account for an additional cerebrospinal fluid compartment. The most common predictors were creatinine clearance and bodyweight, in 2 and 1 studies, respectively. Estimated values of vancomycin clearance and total volume of distribution varied widely from 0.334 to 8.75 L/h (0.0054-0.1279 L/h/kg) and from 7.12 to 501.8 L (0.097-6.97 L/kg), respectively. Almost all studies implemented an exponential interindividual variability model, and the highest variability on clearance was 99.2%.

Measurement of skin blood flow, therefore, provides valuable information regarding heat exchange between the body and the environment. In addition, assessment of skin blood flow can be used to study vascular control mechanisms. Most often, skin blood flow is measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, Doppler ultrasound, laser-Doppler flowmetry, and, more recently, optical coherence tomography.

Among many host RNases, decapping enzymes DCP1 and 2, and 5′→3′ exonuclease XRN1, which are components of the RNA decay machinery, have been extensively studied in prokaryotes, plants, and invertebrates but less so in mammalian systems. As a result, the implication of XRN1 and DCPs in viral replication, in particular, the spatio-temporal dynamics during RNA viral infections remains elusive. Here, we highlight that XRN1 and DCPs play a critical role in limiting several groups of RNA viral infections. This antiviral activity was not obvious in wild-type cells but clearly observed in type I interferon (IFN-I)-deficient cells. Mechanistically, infection with RNA viruses induced the enrichment of XRN1 and DCPs in viral replication complexes (vRCs), hence forming distinct cytoplasmic aggregates. These aggregates served as sites for direct interaction between XRN1, DCP1/2, and viral ribonucleoprotein that contains viral RNA (vRNA). Although these XRN1-DCP1/2-vRC-containing foci resemble antiviral stress granules (SGs) or P-body (PB), they did not colocalize with known SG markers and did not correlate with critical PB functions. Furthermore, the presence of 5′ mono- and 5′ triphosphate structures on vRNA was not required for the formation of XRN1-DCP1/2-vRC-containing foci. On the other hand, single-, double-stranded, and higher-ordered vRNA species play a role but are not deterministic for efficient formation of XRN1-DCP1/2 foci and consequent antiviral activity in a manner proportional to RNA length. These results highlight the mechanism behind the antiviral function of XRN1-DCP1/2 in RNA viral infections independent of IFN-I response, protein kinase R and PB function.",2020-02-07,Cell Death & Differentiation,https://openalex.org/V152938505,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0509-0,2363,2382,27,8,1,18,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004564551,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0509-0,journal-article,3004564551

It influences career progression and rewards, making it a valued commodity in a competitive scientific environment. To better understand authorship practices amongst collaborative teams, this study surveyed authors on collaborative journal articles published between 201 and 2015. Of the 836 respondents, 140 responded to the final open-ended question, which solicited additional comments or remarks regarding the fair distribution of authorship in research teams. This paper presents the analysis of these comments, categorized into four main themes: (1) disagreements, (2) questionable behavior, (3) external influences regarding authorship, and (4) values promoted by researchers. Results suggest that some respondents find ways to effectively manage disagreements in a collegial fashion. Conversely, others explain how distribution of authorship can become a blood sport or a horror story which can negatively affect researchers' wellbeing, scientific productivity and integrity. Researchers fear authorship discussions and often try to avoid openly discussing the situation which can strain team interactions. Unethical conduct is more likely to result from deceit, favoritism, and questionable mentorship and may become more egregious when there is constant bullying and discrimination. Although values of collegiality, transparency and fairness were promoted by researchers, rank and need for success often overpowered ethical decision-making. This research provides new insight into contextual specificities related to fair authorship distribution that can be instrumental in developing applicable training tools to identify, prevent, and mitigate authorship disagreement.",2020-08-01,Science and Engineering Ethics,https://openalex.org/V14881475,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-019-00113-3,1995,2022,26,4,,17,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2948845587,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-019-00113-3,journal-article,2948845587

To date, twenty variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 that predispose families to breast and ovarian cancer have been identified as recurring in the French-Canadian founder population. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and validity of targeted genetic testing for these variants in Montreal French Canadians. A total of 55 breast cancer cases unselected for family history or age of diagnosis were genotyped, along with 194 controls without a personal or family history of cancer. A Sequenom genotyping assay identified a pathogenic variant in 0.2% (5 of 1940) of cancer-free controls, and 3.8% (21/555) of breast cancer cases.

Vascular injury leads to the release of endothelial-derived apoptotic exosome-like vesicles (ApoExo) that contribute to rejection in transplanted organs. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of ApoExo on TLS formation in a model of vascular allograft rejection. Mice transplanted with an allogeneic aortic transplant were injected with ApoExo. The formation of TLS was significantly increased by ApoExo injection along with vascular remodeling and increased levels of antinuclear antibodies and anti-perlecan/LG3 autoantibodies. ApoExo also enhanced allograft infiltration by γδT17 cells. Recipients deficient in γδ cells showed reduced TLS formation and lower autoantibodies levels following ApoExo injection. ApoExo are characterized by proteasome activity, which can be blocked by bortezomib. Bortezomib treated ApoExo reduced the recruitment of γδT17 cells to the allograft, lowered TLS formation, and reduced autoantibody production. This study identifies vascular injury-derived extracellular vesicles (ApoExo), as initiators of TLS formation and demonstrates the pivotal role of γδT17 in coordinating TLS formation and autoantibody production.

In hematopoietic cell transplantation, most of the so-called graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect hinges on the recognition of histocompatibility antigens that reflect immunologically relevant genetic variants between donors and recipients. Whether other variants acquired during the neoplastic transformation, or the aberrant expression of gene products can yield antigenic targets of similar relevance as the minor histocompatibility antigens is actively being pursued. Modern genomics and proteomics have enabled the high throughput identification of candidate antigens for immunotherapy in both autologous and allogeneic settings. As such, these major histocompatibility complex-associated tumor-specific (TSA) and tumor-associated antigens (TAA) can allow for the targeting of multiple blood neoplasms, which is a limitation for other immunotherapeutic approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells. We review the current strategies taken to translate these discoveries into T-cell therapies and propose how these could be introduced in clinical practice. Specifically, we discuss the criteria that are used to select the antigens with the greatest therapeutic value and we review the various T-cell manufacturing approaches in place to either expand antigen-specific T cells from the native repertoire or genetically engineer T cells with minor histocompatibility antigen or TSA/TAA-specific recombinant T-cell receptors.

Although relapses are frequent in FEP, current literature on long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-AP) use in FEP is scarce and studies often exclude patients with SUD. OBJECTIVES To determine the impact of LAI-AP as first-line treatment on psychotic relapses or rehospitalizations in FEP patients with comorbid SUD (FEP-SUD). METHODS This is a naturalistic, longitudinal, 3-year prospective and retrospective study on 23 FEP-SUD admitted in two EIS in Montreal, between 200 and 2012. The patients were divided on the basis of first-line medication introduced, either oral antipsychotics (OAP, n = 206) or LAI-AP (n = 31). Baseline characteristics were compared using χ² test and analysis of variance, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed on relapse and rehospitalization. RESULTS Compared to the OAP group, patients in the LAI-AP group presented worse prognostic factors (eg, history of homelessness). Despite this, the LAI-AP group presented a lower relapse rate (67.7% vs 76.7%), higher relapse-free survival time (69 vs 447 days, P = 0.00 in Kaplan-Meier analysis), and trends for reduced rehospitalization rates (48.4% vs 57.3%) and hospitalization-free survival time (81 vs 619 days, P = 0.06 Kaplan-Meier analysis). Of those receiving OAP as first-line, 41.3% were eventually switched to LAI-AP and displayed worst outcome in relapse and rehospitalization.

This research investigates 20 co-leadership dyads in health care organizations to examine whether, when, and how co-leadership arrangements can enable the bridging of institutional logics. Empirical findings suggest that the potential for bridging through co-leadership arrangements is present, but that it may often be achieved through the assimilation of one side by the other rather than balanced integration of competing demands. We conclude that the challenge of collective leadership (and of co-leadership, in particular) may lie not only in developing smooth relations among multiple leaders and their followers, but also in maintaining and mobilizing the tensions that can make their collaboration most fruitful. We suggest that the collective leadership literature has often missed the significance of this central paradox: that collective leadership may be most needed where it is most difficult to achieve.

To investigate the relationship between heart rate and outcomes in heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and atrial fibrillation (AF) adjusting for natriuretic peptide concentration, a powerful prognosticator.

Methods and results
Of 13 562 patients from two large HFrEF trials, 10 113 (74.6%) were in SR and 3449 (25.4%) in AF. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Heart rate was analysed as a categorical (tertiles, T1–3) and continuous variable (per 10 bpm), separately in patients in SR and AF. Outcomes were adjusted for prognostic variables, including N‐terminal prohormone of B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), and also examined using change from baseline heart rate to 1 year (≤ −10 bpm, ≥ +10 bpm, < ±10 bpm). SR patients with a higher heart rate had worse symptoms and quality of life, more often had diabetes and higher NT‐proBNP concentrations. They had higher risk of the primary endpoint [T3 vs. T1 adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35–1.66; P < 0.001; per 10 bpm: 1.12, 95% CI 1.09–1.16; P < 0.001]. In SR, heart rate was associated with a relatively higher risk of pump failure than sudden death (adjusted HR per 10 bpm 1.17, 95% CI 1.09–1.26; P < 0.001 vs. 1.07, 95% CI 1.02–1.13; P = 0.011). Heart rate was not predictive of any outcome in AF.

Conclusions
In HFrEF, an elevated heart rate was an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients in SR, even after adjustment for NT‐proBNP. There was no relationship between heart rate and outcomes in AF.

With the exception of freshwater mussels (for 3 families of the order Unionida), these DUI-associated features have only been shown in few species [within Mytilidae (order Mytilida) and Veneridae (order Venerida)] because of the few complete sex-specific mitogenomes published for these orders.

The clever application of the principle of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females led to the development of the first test to identify clonal derivation of cells. Initially limited by a low level of informativeness, the applicability of these assays expanded with differential methylation-based assays at highly polymorphic genes such as the human androgen receptor (<i>HUMARA</i>). Twenty years ago, the observation that skewing of XCI ratios increases as women age was the first clue that led to the identification of mutations in the <i>TET2</i> gene in hematologically normal aging individuals. In 2014, large-scale genomic approaches of three cohorts allowed definition of CH, which was reported to increase the risk of developing hematologic cancers and cardiovascular diseases. These observations created a fertile field of investigation aimed at investigating the etiology and consequences of CH. The most frequently mutated genes in CH are <i>DNMT3A, TET2,</i> and <i>ASXL1</i>, which have a role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development and self-renewal.

We systematically assessed the association between HPV and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods We searched electronic databases up to December 1, 2019. We included observational studies on the association between HPV and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a random-effect meta-analysis for each outcome and assessed heterogeneity between studies. Results From 303 citations, we included 3 studies and quantitatively synthesized 3 studies. Human papillomavirus was significantly associated with preterm birth (age-adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–1.88), preterm premature rupture of membranes (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.11–3.45), premature rupture of membranes (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.08–1.86), intrauterine growth restriction (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01–1.37), low birth weight (aOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.33–2.76), and fetal death (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14–4.37). No significant association was found for spontaneous abortion (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.40–3.22) and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.80–1.92). Most of the studies were of moderate or low quality, and substantial between-studies heterogeneity remained unexplained. Conclusions We found a consistent and significant association between HPV and preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Human papillomavirus may also be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and fetal death, but findings are limited by suboptimal control of biases.",2020-06-11,The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://openalex.org/V54542293,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa054,1925,1937,221,12,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005200556,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa054,journal-article,3005200556

This process of performance monitoring is computed by a distributed brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior insular cortex (AIC). Despite being consistently co-activated during different tasks, the precise neuronal computations of each region and their interactions remain elusive. In order to assess the neural mechanism by which the AIC processes performance feedback, we recorded AIC electrophysiological activity in humans. We found that the AIC beta oscillations amplitude is modulated by the probability of performance feedback valence (positive or negative) given the context (task and condition difficulty). Furthermore, the valence of feedback was encoded by delta waves phase-modulating the power of beta oscillations. Finally, connectivity and causal analysis showed that beta oscillations relay feedback information signals to the mPFC. These results reveal that structured oscillatory activity in the anterior insula encodes performance feedback information, thus coordinating brain circuits related to reward-based learning.",2020-06-01,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa017,4011,4025,30,7,1,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008217968,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa017,journal-article,3008217968

The IgG1-Fc N-glycans impact the interaction with FcγRs and are considered a critical quality attribute. Pioneer studies on FcγR N-glycans have unveiled an additional complexity in that the N-glycan linked on the Asn-162 of FcγRIIIa was shown to be directly involved in the strong affinity for afucosylated IgG1. The last few years have thus seen the emergence of many studies investigating the complex influence of FcγRIIIa N-glycans on the interaction with IgG1 through their glycosylation sites or their glycoprofiles. In this context, we performed site-directed mutagenesis along with glycoengineering on FcγRs (FcγRI, FcγRIIaH131/b and FcγRIIIaV158/F158) in an effort to elucidate the impact of FcγRs N-glycans on the interaction with IgG1. Furthermore, we assessed their binding to various trastuzumab glycoforms with an enhanced surface plasmon resonance assay. The FcγRIIIa N-glycans had the highest impact on the interaction with IgG1. More specifically, the N16 glycan positively influenced the affinity (15-fold) for afucosylated IgG1 while the N4 glycan presented a negative impact (2-fold) regardless of the IgG1 glycoforms. Interestingly, only the FcγRIIIa glycoprofile had an impact on the interaction with IgG1 with a 1.5-fold affinity increase when FcγRIIIa displays high-mannose glycans. These results provide invaluable insights into the complex and strong influence of N-glycosylation upon FcγRs/IgG1 binding and are instrumental to further understand the impact of FcγRs N-glycosylation in their natural forms.",2020-05-01,Molecular Immunology,https://openalex.org/V92126311,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.03.010,144,158,121,,0,15,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014050626,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.03.010,journal-article,3014050626

Neuroimaging studies have reported various degrees of structural changes, yet multiple variables in deafness profiles need to be considered for proper interpretation of results. To date, many inconsistencies are reported in the gray and white matter alterations following early profound deafness. The purpose of this study was to provide the first systematic review synthesizing gray and white matter changes in deaf individuals. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in 2 studies comprising 62 deaf individuals. Results: Evidence shows that auditory deprivation significantly alters the white matter across the primary and secondary auditory cortices. The most consistent alteration across studies was in the bilateral superior temporal gyri. Furthermore, reductions in the fractional anisotropy of white matter fibers comprising in inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the subcortical auditory pathway are reported. The reviewed studies also suggest that gray and white matter integrity is sensitive to early sign language acquisition, attenuating the effect of auditory deprivation on neurocognitive development.

However, long-term antipsychotic treatment can produce neuroadaptations that are thought to lead to dopamine supersensitivity. In patients with schizophrenia, this dopamine supersensitivity could compromise treatment efficacy, promote relapse to psychosis and trigger movement disorders. Such effects have been seen in patients treated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics. In non-human animals, chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications, using clinically pertinent doses and modes of administration, can also evoke dopamine supersensitivity. This is indicated by an augmented behavioural response to dopamine agonists and tolerance to the antipsychotic-like effects of ongoing treatment. Here, we first describe antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity in patients with schizophrenia and in laboratory animals. We then review approaches to prevent or reverse antipsychotic-evoked dopamine supersensitivity, based on preclinical animal studies. This evidence suggests that using atypical antipsychotics and regular but intermittent (versus continuous) antipsychotic dosing/D2 receptor occupancy is significantly less likely to produce dopamine supersensitivity. Lastly, we discuss potential neurobiological mechanisms. These include changes at the D2 receptor, but also other changes within and outside of the dopamine system. We conclude that in parallel to the search for new antipsychotic molecules, we need to better understand how different dosing regimens with currently used medications influence long-term outcome. There is also a pressing need to better characterize the development and expression of dopamine supersensitivity in humans. This will help determine the treatment strategies least likely to evoke dopamine supersensitivity.

While several microRNAs modulate beta cell homeostasis, miR-375 stands out as it is highly expressed in beta cells where it regulates beta cell function, proliferation and differentiation. As glucose metabolism is central in all aspects of beta cell functioning, we investigated the role of miR-375 in this process using human and rat islets; the latter being an appropriate model for in-depth investigation. We used forced expression and repression of mR-375 in rat and human primary islet cells followed by analysis of insulin secretion and metabolism. Additionally, miR-375 expression and glucose-induced insulin secretion were compared in islets from rats at different developmental ages. We found that overexpressing of miR-375 in rat and human islet cells blunted insulin secretion in response to glucose but not to α-ketoisocaproate or KCl. Further, miR-375 reduced O 2 consumption related to glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism, but not in response to α-ketoisocaproate. Concomitantly, lactate production was augmented suggesting that glucose-derived pyruvate is shifted away from mitochondria. Forced miR-375 expression in rat or human islets increased mRNA levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, but decreased those of pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase1. Finally, reduced miR-375 expression was associated with maturation of fetal rat beta cells and acquisition of glucose-induced insulin secretion function.

Because of the strict maternal inheritance (SMI) of mitochondria in animals, haplotypes that negatively affect male fertility can become fixed in populations. This phenomenon is known as ‘mother's curse’. Doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria is a stable exception in bivalves, which entails two mtDNA lineages that evolve independently and are transmitted separately through oocytes and sperm. This makes the DUI mitochondrial lineages subject to different sex-specific selective sieves during mtDNA evolution, thus DUI is a unique model to evaluate how direct selection on sperm mitochondria could contribute to male reproductive fitness. In this study, we tested the impact of mtDNA variants on sperm performance and bioenergetics in DUI and SMI species. Analyses also involved measures of sperm performance following inhibition of main energy pathways and sperm response to oocyte presence. Compared to SMI, DUI sperm exhibited (i) low speed and linearity, (ii) a strict OXPHOS-dependent strategy of energy production, and (iii) a partial metabolic shift towards fermentation following egg detection.

Decrease in or total loss of winter diapause expression recently observed in some species could arise from inhibiting maternal effects. In this study, we explored transgenerational effects on diapause expression and traits in one commercial and one Canadian field strain of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. These strains were reared under short photoperiod (8:16 h LD) and low temperature (14 °C) conditions over two generations. Diapause levels, developmental times, physiological and morphological traits were measured. Diapause levels increased after one generation in the Canadian field but not in the commercial strain. For both strains, the second generation took longer to develop than the first one. Tibia length and wing surface decreased over generations while fat content increased. A crossed-generations experiment focusing on the industrial parasitoid strain showed that offspring from mothers reared at 14 °C took longer to develop, were heavier, taller with wider wings and with more fat reserves than those from mothers reared at 20 °C (8:16 h LD). No effect of the mother rearing conditions was shown on diapause expression. Additionally to direct plasticity of the offspring, results suggest transgenerational plasticity effects on diapause expression, development time, and on the values of life-history traits. We demonstrated that populations showing low diapause levels may recover higher levels through transgenerational plasticity in response to diapause-induction cues, provided that environmental conditions are reaching the induction-thresholds specific to each population.

Despite high security standards, accidents still happen and the transportation of hazmat causes fear among the population. Therefore, the society expects authorities to distribute the risk fairly. To support such a fair distribution, we propose a new population-based risk definition that evaluates the risk for the population in any given area with respect to its multimodal transportation network. Moreover, we propose different objective functions for equilibrating the risk and extend the bilevel Hazmat Transport Network Design Problem by considering several transportation modes. In this problem, the government wants to equilibrate the risk among the population centers by restricting links to the shipment of hazardous goods. When taking that decision, the government has to anticipate the reaction of the carriers who want to minimize the transportation costs. This bilevel problem is transformed into a single-level mixed-integer linear program. The numerical results give insights to authorities (1) on how to evaluate risk for a fair distribution, and (2) that there is a positive convex relation between risk minimization and risk equilibration. The zones with high risk will initially benefit from the risk redistribution. However, pure equality just penalizes zones with low risk. Therefore, a significant improvement in risk distribution can be achieved at the cost of just a small increase in total risk.

Identifying the key factors that structure the fungal microbiome of the plant rhizosphere is a necessary step in optimizing plant production. In a long-term field experiment conducted at three locations in the Canadian prairies, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) diversification of cropping systems influences the fungal microbiome of the canola (Brassica napus) rhizosphere; (2) the canola rhizosphere has a core fungal microbiome, i.e., a set of fungi always associated with canola; and (3) some taxa within the rhizosphere microbiome of canola are highly interrelated and fit the description of hub taxa. Our results show that crop diversification has a significant effect on the structure of the rhizosphere fungal community but not on fungal diversity. We also discovered and described a canola core microbiome made up of one zero-radius operational taxonomic unit (ZOTU), cf. Olpidium brassicae, and an eco-microbiome found only in 201 consisting of 4 ZOTUs. Using network analysis, we identified four hub taxa in 2013: ZOTU1 (Acremonium sp.), ZOTU2 (Sordariomycetes sp.), ZOTU4 (Mortierella sp.) and ZOTU17 (cf. Ganoderma applanatum), and one hub taxon, ZOTU1 (cf. Mortierella gamsii) in 2016. None of these most interacting taxa belonged to the core microbiome or eco-microbiome for each year of sampling. This temporal variability puts into question the idea of a plant core fungal microbiome and its stability.

Though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naive patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. A systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable CD/UC patients from infliximab to CT-P13. A literature search using PubMed and abstracts/posters from  major gastroenterology conferences from 201 to 201 was completed. Two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. Key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance. A total of 4 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 4 observational trials, and  case series) were included. Most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. Limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects. The majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe.

In particular, planet formation models predict that many of them should have accreted enough gas to become gas giants. Here we examine the role of the protoplanetary disk in the cooling and contraction of the protoplanetary envelope. In particular, we investigate the effects of 1) the thermal state of the disk as set by the relative size of heating by accretion or irradiation, and whether its energy is transported by radiation or convection, and 2) advection of entropy into the outer envelope by disk flows that penetrate the Hill sphere, as found in 3D global simulations. We find that, at  and  AU, this flow at the level reported in the non-isothermal simulations where it penetrates only to ~ 0. times the Hill radius has little effect on the cooling rate since most of the envelope mass is concentrated close to the core, and far from the flow. On the other hand, at 0.1 AU, the envelope quickly becomes fully-radiative, nearly isothermal, and thus cannot cool down, stalling gas accretion. This effect is significantly more pronounced in convective disks, leading to envelope mass orders of magnitude lower. Entropy advection at 0.1 AU in either radiative or convective disks could therefore explain why super-Earths failed to undergo runaway accretion. These results highlight the importance of the conditions and energy transport in the protoplanetary disk for the accretion of planetary envelopes.",2020-05-11,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,https://openalex.org/V195663288,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa914,2440,2448,494,2,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010289210,https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa914,journal-article,3010289210

Thus, MCs immune function could be modulated by their mechanosensitivity. This property has been identified as the trigger mechanism of needling acupuncture, a traditional oriental therapy. Previously we have demonstrated the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a stress-responsive signalling molecule, from mechanical-perturbed MCs. The current work explores its underlying mechanisms. We noticed that propagation of intracellular free Ca2+ occurred among HMC-1 cells in response to 50% hypotonic shock. Additionally, amplifying cascade of ATP-induced ATP release was observed in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by medium displacement, which could be mimicked by exogenous ATP (exoATP). Secondary ATP liberation induced by low level (5 nmol/L) of exoATP was reduced by inhibiting ecto-ATPase-dependent ADP production with ARL67156, or blocking P2 receptors with suramin or PPADS, or with specific P2Y13 receptor antagonist MRS2211, or siRNA. Secondary ATP release induced by higher dose (20 μmol/L) of exoATP, sufficient to stimulate P2X7 receptor, was attenuated by suramin, PPADS or specific P2X7 receptor antagonist BBG, or siRNA. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed mRNA expression of P2Y13 and P2X7 in RBL-2H3 cells. Additionally, such secondary ATP release was attenuated by DPCPX, specific antagonist of adenosine A1 receptor, but not by MRS2179, specific inhibitor of P2Y receptor. In summary, mechanosensitive ATP release from MCs is facilitated by paracrine/autocrine stimulation of P2Y13 and P2X7 receptors. This multi-receptor combination could mediate transmission of information from a local site to distal areas, enabling communication with multiple surrounding cells to coordinate and synchronize their function.",2020-03-10,Experimental Dermatology,https://openalex.org/V158010168,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14093,499,508,29,5,0,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010697254,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14093,journal-article,3010697254

A systematic map,"Abstract Background There is growing evidence of the potential negative consequences of altered flow regimes, in terms of magnitude, frequency, timing, duration or season pattern, on fluvial ecosystems and the fisheries they support. The scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of the effects of flow alteration on fish productivity. We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers. Methods To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases, 2 organizational websites, one search engine, and 29 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources. We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient coverage for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps. Review findings A total of 136 studies from 119 articles were included in the systematic map database and used to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial trend design i.e., lacking a ‘true’ before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro), and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diversion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival, performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs). Conclusions This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of flow regime other than magnitude (e.g., flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all interventions) affect population viability.",2020-12-01,Environmental Evidence,https://openalex.org/V2737036037,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z,,,,,1,14,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024059517,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-020-00190-z,journal-article,3024059517

Few studies have yet explored whether this association holds when accounting for tobacco retailers found in the multiple environments where people conduct their daily activities, that is, their activity space. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data from 921 young adults (18- to 25-years old) participating in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking (Montreal, Canada). Respondents self-reported sociodemographic, smoking, and activity location data. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the association between smoking cessation and (1) the number of tobacco retailers (counts), and (2) the distance to the closest retailer (proximity) in participants’ residential neighborhood and activity space. Results Smoking cessation was positively associated with low and intermediate tertile levels of tobacco retailer counts in both the residential neighborhood and activity space, and with the furthest distance level in the activity space [PR (95% CI) = 1.21 (1.02 to 1.43)]. Conclusions Individuals encounter resources in the course of their regular daily activities that may hamper smoking cessation. This study highlights the relevance of considering the tobacco retail environment of both individuals’ residential neighborhood and activity space to understand its association with smoking cessation. Implications This article contributes to the literature on the association between the tobacco retail environment and smoking cessation in young adults by moving beyond the residential neighborhood to also assess individuals’ access to tobacco retailers in the multiple areas where they regularly spend time, that is, their activity space.

Given its extensive reciprocal connectivity with the visual cortex, it allows the cortico-thalamocortical transfer of visual information. Nonetheless, knowledge of the nature of the pulvinar inputs to the cortex remains elusive. We investigated the impact of silencing the pulvinar on the contrast response function of neurons in  distinct hierarchical cortical areas in the cat (areas 1 and 21a). Pulvinar inactivation altered the response gain in both areas, but with larger changes observed in area 21a. A theoretical model was proposed, simulating the pulvinar contribution to cortical contrast responses by modifying the excitation-inhibition balanced state of neurons across the cortical hierarchy. Our experimental and theoretical data showed that the pulvinar exerts a greater modulatory influence on neuronal activity in area 21a than in the primary visual cortex, indicating that the pulvinar impact on cortical visual neurons varies along the cortical hierarchy.",2020-03-14,Cerebral Cortex,https://openalex.org/V117898428,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz149,1068,1086,30,3,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968955262,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz149,journal-article,2968955262

It is mainly due to the presence of limited active adsorption sites and low surface area that governs an ineffective adsorption potential of the sand material. Herein, graphitized sand was synthesized to tackle the above limitations using two sugar solution sources: a) brewery effluent (as a low-cost solution) (GS1) and; b) sucrose solution (GS2). GS1 showed 68%, 60%, and 99% higher maximum adsorption constant (qmax) for divalent metal ions: iron, copper, and manganese, respectively as compared to raw sand (RS). Coating of MnO2 over the graphitized sand (GSMs: GS1M and GS2M) further helped in Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) removal (3%-9%) when inoculated with MC-LR-degraders, but was not as effective in removing metals, organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to just graphitized sand (GS1 or GS2). Inoculating G and GSMs (for both sugar sources) not only helped in higher MC-LR removal (10%-15% more) but also enhanced the removal of other water contaminants including metals, organic nitrogen, and carbon. GS1 showed 20% and 50% more MC-LR removal than the sand material when tested at a low and high initial concentration of MC-LR ( µg/L and 5 µg/L). The highest breakthrough period was obtained for GS1 filter using  mg/L Rhodamine-B dye, which was 1 times (4 min) more than the raw sand filter and almost 2.5 times (second best, 2 min) than GS1M.

Data came from a random sample of 98 women and 1,037 men working in 6 Canadian establishments. Multilevel path analyses were performed separately for men and for women.

To add to our understanding of BEF relationships in wetlands, we evaluated plant diversity effects on water purification through a meta-analysis of freshwater experimental wetlands comparing monocultures to mixtures. We found 2 studies that matched our criteria for BEF analysis, for a total of 56 diversity effects on pollutant removal. Overall, the meta-analysis shows no significant effect of plant richness on removal of total suspended solids, but a positive effect on chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen removal, and a marginal effect on phosphorus removal. Thus, the results of this meta-analysis are consistent with reports of an overall positive biodiversity effect on ecosystem properties. An analysis of moderator variables shows that the experimental context (size of the experimental units, nutrient load, duration of the experiment) does not explain much of the residual variance. For pollutants that benefit from a positive plant richness effects on removal, mixtures do not perform better than the best monoculture. We found no evidence that plant richness effects are due to functional complementarity among species rather than to the presence of particularly efficient species. Complementarity effects may be less prevalent in highly productive, nutrient-rich wetlands, compared to nutrient-limited environments such as natural grasslands. Although findings must be confirmed by long-term field experiments under natural conditions, result from experimental wetland systems may contribute to a better understanding of biodiversity effect on ecosystem functions in wetlands, in addition to guide practices in natural wetland restoration and the use of constructed wetlands for water treatment.",2020-06-01,Ecological Applications,https://openalex.org/V166870025,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2074,,,30,4,0,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3002942406,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2074,journal-article,3002942406

The traditional approach in the management of the quality drinking water, and relying on end-product testing, has proven ineffective in protecting public health. Therefore, the transition to a systematic approach in drinking water supply systems management from the source to the consumer tap was taken as a water safety plan (WSP). Objective . The study aims to investigate the health-related hazardous events in order to decide on the best risk-reduction strategies in the supply of drinking water in the Gaza strip. Methods . A semiquantitative matrix method for risk assessment was applied. Also, chlorine residual, electrical conductivity, and nitrate concentration further tested in 109 water wells, 109 small-scale water desalination plants, 19 tanker trucks, and 38 households distributed over five governorates of the Gaza strip. Results . The mean of the measured chlorine residual values was less than the recommended national and international limits (0.2–1 mg/liter). The mean of electrical conductivity at catchment points and household municipal water taps was 2165.1 μ S·cm −1 and 200 μ S·cm −1 , respectively. Furthermore, zero percent of water samples met the recommended criteria, indicating that the groundwater in the Gaza strip is nonpotable. Only 12.8% and 8.8% of water samples met the permissible levels at catchment areas and municipal water at household, respectively, indicating sever health impacts on the public. Moreover, the most hazardous events were related to high levels of groundwater salinity, the low level of disinfection, the effect of electricity outages on the efficiency of the desalination process, and leakage of water from the tanker truck tank reservoirs. Therefore, urgent interventions are required to improve the quality of water and to mitigate the possible health effects. Conclusion . The prioritization of hazardous events that are proportional to the degree of their attributed risk could help guide in making the right risk-reduction decisions. Urgent interventions are required to improve the quality of water and to mitigate the possible health effects.",2020-01-29,Journal of Environmental and Public Health,https://openalex.org/V11392764,Hindawi Limited,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7194780,,,,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004087513,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7194780,journal-article,3004087513

Furthermore, this phase in life is also the time in which youth substance use begins. Several studies have demonstrated the differential associations of alcohol and cannabis use concerning the neurocognitive functioning of both males and females. Past and contemporary literature on gender-specific effects in neuroscience of addiction is predominantly based on cross-sectional datasets and data that is limited in terms of measurement variability. Given the importance of gender-specific effects in addiction studies, and in order to address the two above-mentioned gaps in the literature, the present study aimed to compare neurocognitive functioning of male and female adolescents in the context of cannabis and alcohol use, while employing a longitudinal design with multiple repeated measurements. Participants were 3,826 high school students (47% female; mean age, 12.7), who were recruited from 31 high schools in the greater Montreal area. Participants were requested to complete annual surveys for five consecutive years, from 7th to 11th grade, assessing their alcohol/cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning (working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibition control). The analytical strategy focused on the longitudinal association between each predictor (female, male) and each of the outcomes (domains of neurocognitive functioning). Multilevel linear models assessed the association of alcohol and cannabis consumption and the four domains of neurocognitive functioning. Results revealed a gender by within-subject interaction, suggesting a weaker effect of yearly fluctuation of cannabis use on working memory among males compared to females. Our findings suggest a different pattern of neurocognitive impairment of female and male working memory after using cannabis over the course of adolescence. Early initiation of cannabis use potentially results in more spatial working memory deficits in female adolescents. This may negatively influence young females' capacity in academic settings and lead to significant impairment in adulthood, which critically decreases the individual's quality of life.",2020-04-07,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V146364893,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00095,,,14,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3015329968,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00095,journal-article,3015329968

The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical applicability of the FGS in real-time when compared with image assessment, and to evaluate the influence of sedation and surgery on FGS scores in cats. Methods Sixty-five female cats (age: 1.37 ± 0. years and body weight: 2.85 ± 0.7 kg) were included in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Cats were sedated with intramuscular acepromazine and buprenorphine. Following induction with propofol, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and cats underwent ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Pain was evaluated at baseline, 15 min after sedation, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1 and 24 h after extubation using the FGS in real-time (FGS-RT). Cats were video-recorded simultaneously at baseline, 15 min after sedation, and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after extubation for subsequent image assessment (FGS-IMG), which was performed six months later by the same observer. The agreement between FGS-RT and FGS-IMG scores was calculated using the Bland &amp; Altman method for repeated measures. The effects of sedation (baseline versus 15 min) and OVH (baseline versus 24 h) were assessed using linear mixed models. Responsiveness to the administration of rescue analgesia (FGS scores before versus one hour after) was assessed using paired t -tests. Results Minimal bias (−0.057) and narrow limits of agreement (−0.351 to 0.237) were observed between the FGS-IMG and FGS-RT. Scores at baseline (FGS-RT: 0.16 ± 0.1 and FGS-IMG: 0.1 ± 0.13) were not different after sedation (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.15, p = 0.3 and FGS-IMG: 0.16 ± 0.15, p = 0.99) nor at 24 h after extubation (FGS-RT: 0.16 ± 0.12, p = 0. and FGS-IMG: 0. ± 0.12, p = 0.96). Thirteen cats required rescue analgesia; their FGS scores were lower one hour after analgesic administration (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.1 and FGS-IMG: 0.1 ± 0.17) than before (FGS-RT: 0. ± 0.24, p = 0.00 and FGS-IMG: 0. ± 0.19, p = 0.015). Conclusions Real-time assessment slightly overestimates image scoring; however, with minimal clinical impact. Sedation with acepromazine-buprenorphine and ovariohysterectomy using a balanced anesthetic protocol did not influence the FGS scores.

LiFePO 4 (LFP) melt-synthesized from ore concentrate fits this role, but the manufacturing process requires additional steps that includes grinding large ingots into a nanoparticle suspension followed by a dessication step. Spray drying, rather than tray drying, creates a mesoporous powder that enhances wettability. Adding lactose and high-Mw polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to the suspension of nanostructures followed by pyrolysis, creates a carbon-cage that interconnects the cathode nanoparticles, imparting better capacity ( LiFePO 4 /C: 161 mA h g−1 at 0.1C), discharge rate (flat plateau, 145 mA h g−1 at 5C), and cyclability (91% capacity retention after 75 cycles at 1C). Particle size affects battery stability; PVA increases the suspension's viscosity and alters the powder morphology, from spherical to hollow particles. A model describes the non-Newtonian suspension's rheology changing: shear, temperature, LFP and PVA loading. Carbon precursors prevent the nanoparticles from sintering during calcination but lactose gasifies 50% of the carbon, according to the chemical and allotropic composition measurements (CS analyzer, XPS, and Raman). The carbon-cage imparts microporosity and we correlate the SEM and TEM powder's morphology with N  physisorption porosimetry.

Triage guidelines, however, differ on whether limited resources should focus on maximizing lives or life-years. Choosing between these two approaches has implications for neonatology. Neonatal units have ventilators, some adaptable for adults. This raises the question of whether, in crisis conditions, guidelines for treating extremely premature babies should be altered to free-up ventilators. Some adults who need ventilators will have a survival rate higher than some extremely premature babies. But surviving babies will likely live longer, maximizing life-years. Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults. When triaging or choosing between patients, justice demands fair guidelines. Premature babies do not deserve special consideration; they deserve equal consideration. Solidarity is crucial but must consider needs specific to patient populations and avoid biases against people with disabilities and extremely premature babies.",2020-05-13,American Journal of Bioethics,https://openalex.org/V41709181,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1764134,37,43,20,7,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3025216005,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1764134,journal-article,3025216005

Here, using an array of sixteen validated BRET-based biosensors, we analyzed the ability of seven different β-adrenergic ligands to engage five distinct signalling pathways downstream of the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR). In addition to generating signalling signatures and capturing functional selectivity for the different ligands toward these pathways, we also revealed coupling to signalling pathways that have not previously been ascribed to the βAR. These include coupling to G z and G 12 pathways. The signalling cascade linking the β 1 AR to calcium mobilization was also characterized using a combination of BRET-based biosensors and CRISPR-engineered HEK 29 cells lacking the Gαs subunit or with pharmacological or genetically engineered pathway inhibitors. We show that both G s and G 12 are required for the full calcium response.

Obesity is recognized as a low-grade inflammatory disease and is linked with several comorbidities such as diabetes, circulatory disease, common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as chronic pain. Adipocytes are a major neuroendocrine organ that continually, and systemically, releases pro-inflammatory factors. While the exact mechanisms driving obesity-induced pain remain poorly defined, nociceptor hypersensitivity may result from the systemic state of inflammation characteristic of obesity as well as weight surplus-induced mechanical stress. Obesity and pain also share various genetic mutations, lifestyle risk factors, and metabolic pathways. For instance, fat pads are often found hyper-innervated and rich in immune cell types of multiple origins. These immunocytes release cytokines, amplifying nociceptor function, which, in turn, via locally released neuropeptides, sustain immunocytes' function. Here, we posit that along with mechanical stress stemming from extra weight, the local neuro-immune interplay occurring within the fat pads maintains the state of chronic low-grade inflammation and heightens sensory hypersensitivity. Overall, stopping such harmful neuro-immune crosstalk may constitute a novel pathway to prevent obesity-associated comorbidities, including neuronal hypersensitivity.",2020-06-09,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/V146364893,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00181,,,14,,1,13,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035124045,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00181,journal-article,3035124045

Schools are endowed with priorities over students. Incorporating constraints from different applications, priorities are often modelled as choice functions over sets of students. It has been argued that the most desirable criterion for an assignment is stability; there should not exist any blocking pair: no student shall prefer some school to her assigned school and have higher priority than some student who got into that school or the school has an empty seat. We propose a blocking notion where in addition it must be possible to assign the student to her preferred school. We then define the following stability criterion for a set of assignments: a set of assignments is legal if and only if any assignment outside the set is blocked with some assignment in the set and no two assignments inside the set block each other. We show that under very basic conditions on priorities, there always exists a unique legal set of assignments, and that this set has a structure common to the set of stable assignments: (i) it is a lattice and (ii) it satisfies the rural hospitals theorem. The student-optimal legal assignment is efficient and provides a solution for the conflict between stability and efficiency.",2020-07-01,The Review of Economic Studies,https://openalex.org/V88935262,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdz041,1837,1875,87,4,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2968470372,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdz041,journal-article,2968470372

Despite its high prevalence -more than double the general population rate- pain among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) remains an overlooked issue in both health and social sciences. Using the theoretical framework of sociology of illness experience, the aim of this qualitative study was to understand how the experience of illicit drug use shapes the pain experience. We conducted in-depth interviews with 2 individuals who used street opioids and/or cocaine (with or without any other drug) and had suffered from pain for three months or more. Participants were recruited from July 201 to May 2018, in Montreal (Canada). Social deprivation and drug use increased PWUD's exposure to a wide range of health issues including pain. Even when intense, pain was often described as peripheral in their life given their many other problems. They experienced double stigmatization due to the cumulation of two socially devalued statuses, addicts and chronic pain sufferers.

The electrical conductivity of water is varied by adding HCl at very low concentrations. The discharge and water properties are determined by measuring the current-voltage waveforms and monitoring water acidity and conductivity, respectively. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy analyses of the produced nanoparticles show that increasing water conductivity, by adding HCl, promotes the synthesis of Cu-based nanomaterials. Depending on the initial water conductivity, various nanostructures are observed, including nanoflakes of cuprite (Cu2O), dendrites with high Cu content, and unordered micrometric aggregates with a mixed Cu/Cu2O content.

Objectives of this study were to verify, with an artificial intelligence-based nonlinear approach, if the estimation of ITS data could be facilitated, in addition to providing a computationally explicit equation. Methods Dataset were from a study of Hawley et al. (2018) in which they evaluated the impact of UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapies on the incidence of total hip (THR) and knee (TKR) replacement in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We used the newly developed Generalized Structure Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) model, a nonlinear method, for the prediction of THR and TKR incidence in the abovementioned population. Results In contrast to linear regression, the GS-GMDH yields for both THR and TKR prediction values that almost fitted with the measured ones. These models demonstrated a low mean absolute relative error (0.1 and 0.09 respectively) and high correlation coefficient values (0.9 and 0.78). The GS-GMDH model for THR demonstrated 6.4/1000 person years (PYs) at the mid-point of the linear regression line post-NICE, whereas at the same point linear regression is 4.12/1000 PYs, a difference of around 35%. Similarly for the TKR, the linear regression to the datasets post-NICE was 9.05/1000 PYs, which is lower by about 27% than the GS-GMDH values of 12.47/1000 PYs. Importantly, with the GS-GMDH models, there is no need to identify the change point and intervention lag time as they simulate ITS continually throughout modelling. Conclusions The results demonstrate that in the medical field, when looking at the estimation of the impact of a new drug using ITS, a nonlinear GS-GMDH method could be used as a better alternative to regression-based methods data processing. In addition to yielding more accurate predictions and requiring less time-consuming experimental measurements, this nonlinear method addresses, for the first time, one of the most challenging tasks in ITS modelling, i.e. avoiding the need to identify the change point and intervention lag time.",2020-01-09,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,https://openalex.org/V138959710,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105315,105315,105315,189,,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999737027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105315,journal-article,2999737027

This study aims to reconstruct the changes that occurred over 35 years in the plant communities of temperate bogs subjected to indirect human-induced disturbances. In 2015-17, we resurveyed the vascular flora of 7 plots located in 1 bogs of southern Québec (Canada) first sampled in 1982. We evaluated changes in species richness, frequency of occurrence and abundance, while considering species shade-tolerance and preferential habitat. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and evaluated differences between the two surveys using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. We found a significant increase in species richness and beta diversity over the last 35 years associated with major species turnovers, indicating a biotic differentiation of the Sphagnum-bog plant communities. These changes were mostly associated with an increase in the abundance and frequency of shade-tolerant and facultative species, suggesting a global phenomenon of woody encroachment. Because the observed changes occurred in a few decades on sites free of in situ human disturbances, we suggest that they were likely induced by the synergic effect of the agricultural drainage occurring in the surrounding mineral soils, climate warming, and nitrogen atmospheric depositions. We also believe that further changes are to be expected, as the triggering factors persist. Finally, our results highlight the need for increased bog conservation or restauration efforts. Indeed, a rise in beta diversity due to the introduction of nearby terrestrial species could induce biotic homogenization of the bog flora with that of surrounding habitats and ultimately impoverish the regional species pool.",2020-02-13,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229146,e0229146,e0229146,15,2,1,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005973505,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229146,journal-article,3005973505

However, the dynamics of Si during long-term ecosystem development remain poorly documented, especially the changes in soils in terms of plant availability. We studied a 2-million-year soil chronosequence to examine how long-term changes in soil properties influence soil Si pools. The chronosequence exhibits extreme mineralogical changes—from carbonate-rich to quartz-rich soils—where a carbonate weathering domain is succeeded by a silicate weathering domain. Plant-available Si concentrations were lowest in young soils (Holocene, < 6.5 ka), increased in intermediate soils (Middle Pleistocene, 120 ka), and finally decreased toward the oldest, quartz-rich soil (Early Pleistocene, 2 Ma). Silicon availability is likely low and relatively constant in the young soils because (1) carbonate weathering consumes protons and therefore reduces weathering of silicate minerals and (2) Si adsorption by secondary minerals is high in alkaline soils. In the middle-aged sites, Si availability rises with the loss of carbonates and the formation of kaolinite that appears to drive its concentration, and then falls in the oldest sites with quartz enrichment. The increasing accumulation of biogenic silica following carbonate depletion indicates stronger soil–plant Si cycling as ecosystem development proceeds. A literature analysis confirms the shift in processes controlling Si availability between the carbonate and silicate weathering domains. Overall, our results show a nonlinear response of plant-available Si to long-term pedogenesis, with likely important implications for the Si-related functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.",2020-02-19,Ecosystems,https://openalex.org/V83499872,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00493-9,1614,1630,23,8,0,12,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007687870,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00493-9,journal-article,3007687870

Its two forms, BRKS (OMIM # 259450) and BRKS2 (OMIM # 609220), reflect autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance of FKBP10 and PLOD2 loss-of-function mutations, respectively. A 10-year-old girl was referred with blue sclera, osteopenia, poorly-healing fragility fractures, Wormian skull bones, cleft soft palate, congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae, progressive scoliosis, bell-shaped thorax, restrictive and reactive pulmonary disease, protrusio acetabuli, short stature, and additional dysmorphic features without joint contractures. Iliac crest biopsy after alendronate treatment that improved her bone density revealed low trabecular connectivity, abundant patchy osteoid, and active bone formation with widely-spaced tetracycline labels. Chromosome 22q11 deletion analysis for velocardiofacial syndrome, COL1A1 and COL1A2 sequencing for prevalent types of OI, and Sanger sequencing of LRP5, PPIB, FKBP10, and IFITM5 for rare pediatric osteoporoses were negative. Copy number microarray excluded a contiguous gene syndrome. Instead, exome sequencing revealed two missense variants in PLOD2 which encodes procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase  (lysyl hydroxylase 2, LH2); exon 8, c.797G>T, p.Gly266Val (paternal), and exon 12, c.1280A>G, p.Asn427Ser (maternal). In the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, low frequency (Gly266Val, 0.0000419) and absence (Asn427Ser) implicated both variants as mutations of PLOD2. The father, mother, and sister (who carried the exon 1 defect) were reportedly well with normal parental DXA findings. BRKS2, characterized by under-hydroxylation of type I collagen telopeptides compromising their crosslinking, has been reported in at least 1 probands/families. Most PLOD2 mutations involve exons 17-19 (of 2 total) encoding the C-terminal domain with LH activity. However, truncating defects (nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations) are also found throughout PLOD2. In three reports, AR PLOD2 mutations are not associated with congenital contractures. Our patient's missense defects lie within the central domain of unknown function of PLOD2. In our patient, compound heterozygosity with PLOD2 mutations is associated with a clinical phenotype distinctive from classic BRKS2 indicating that when COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutation testing is negative for OI without congenital contractures or pterygia, atypical BRK should be considered.",2020-01-01,Bone,https://openalex.org/V121725775,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2019.115047,,,,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2970107915,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2019.115047,journal-article,2970107915

However, the mechanisms that mediate human heat adaptation have remained elusive. We tested the hypothesis that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature. Skin sympathetic nerve activity, comprising the efferent neural signal that activates heat loss thermoeffectors, was measured in healthy adults exposed to passive heat stress before and after a 7 day heat acclimation protocol. Heat acclimation reduced the activation threshold for skin sympathetic nerve activity, leading to an earlier activation of cutaneous vasodilatation and sweat production. These findings demonstrate that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature in humans. ABSTRACT Heat acclimation improves autonomic temperature regulation in humans. However, the mechanisms that mediate human heat adaptation remain poorly understood. The present study tested the hypothesis that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature. Body temperatures, skin sympathetic nerve activity, cutaneous vasodilatation, and sweat production were measured in 14 healthy adults (nine men and five women, aged 27 ± 5 years) during passive heat stress performed before and after a 7 day heat acclimation protocol. Heat acclimation increased whole-body sweat rate [+0.54 L h-1 (0.32, 0.75), P < 0.01] and reduced resting core temperature [-0.29°C (-0.40, -0.18), P < 0.01].

Studies have already shown that using a smartphone while walking impairs attention and increases the risk of accidents. This study seeks to determine if smartphone-addiction proneness magnifies the risks of using a smartphone while walking. In an experimental design, participants, while walking on a treadmill and engaged in a smartphone task, were required to switch tasks by responding to an external stimulus, i.e., determining the direction of movement of a point-light walker. Participants were chosen to cover a range of smartphone-addiction proneness. Four smartphone-use conditions were simulated: a control condition with no smartphone-use, an individual conversation condition, a gaming condition, and a group conversation condition. Our results show that using a smartphone while walking decreases accuracy and increases the number of missed stimuli. Moreover, participants with higher smartphone-addiction proneness scores were also prone to missing more stimuli, and this effect was found regardless of experimental condition. The effect of the smartphone task on accuracy and the number of missed stimuli was mediated by the emotional arousal caused by the smartphone task. Smartphone-addiction proneness was positively correlated with a declared frequency of smartphone use while walking. Furthermore, of all the smartphone tasks, the gaming condition was found to be the most distracting.",2020-07-01,Addictive Behaviors,https://openalex.org/V186215666,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106346,106346,106346,106,,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005290843,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106346,journal-article,3005290843

Despite Klebsiella mastitis being clinically impairing in cows and costly to the industry, only a few studies describe Klebsiella isolated from mastitis cases. The aim of this work was to characterize species of Klebsiella involved in clinical mastitis cases in Canada. Klebsiella isolated from clinical mastitis cases (n = 53) were identified to the species level using a biochemical test panel and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The rpoB gene sequence was used as the gold standard method and identified Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 40), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Raoultella ornithinolytica (n = 2), and Raoultella planticola (n = 2). Raoultella, a genus closely related to Klebsiella, was also accurately identified using mass spectrometry but not via biochemical testing. Using the disc diffusion technique, 3 (58%) isolates were found to be susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (n = 18). The remaining 2 (42%) isolates were resistant to  or more of the following antimicrobials: kanamycin (2%), streptomycin (38%), spectinomycin (13%), sulfisoxazole (13%), and tetracycline (19%). The following antimicrobial resistance genes were identified: tetA, tetB, sul1, strA/strB, and aadA. Random amplified polymorphic DNA revealed the majority of our isolates as unrelated and having different patterns, indicating environmental contamination as the primary source of infection. All isolates were shown to be biofilm producers. In conclusion, although antimicrobial resistance was low for both Klebsiella and Raoultella species, genetically related Klebsiella spp. isolates appeared to be more resistant.",2020-02-20,Journal of Dairy Science,https://openalex.org/V28349394,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17324,3392,3400,103,4,1,11,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007462814,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17324,journal-article,3007462814

Two subfamilies, topo I and topo III, are present in bacteria. Topo I, found in all of them, relaxes negative supercoiling, while topo III acts as a decatenase in replication. However, recent results suggest that they can also act as back-up for each other. Because they are ubiquitous, type 1A enzymes are expected to be essential for cell viability. Single topA (topo I) and topB (topo III) null mutants of Escherichia coli are viable, but for topA only with compensatory mutations. Double topA topB null mutants were initially believed to be non-viable. However, in two independent studies, results of next generation sequencing (NGS) have recently shown that double topA topB null mutants of Bacillus subtilis and E. coli are viable when they carry parC parE gene amplifications.

The quality of each study and overall quality of evidence were assessed using the PEDro and the GRADE scales.Results: Eighteen studies were included (good PEDro and very low GRADE-scores). In seven, the experimental groups showed significant increases in physical activity (aerobics, resistance, and home-based training; counseling, aerobics, resistance, and home-based training; electrical stimulation during walking; functional-task training; robot-assisted arm therapy; accelerometer-based feedback, and physical activity encouragement). In seven, there were no significant between-group differences (physical activity plan; stretching, use of toe-spreaders, standard treatment; counseling; circuit video-game; functional-task; counseling and cognitive training).

Reviewers independently selected and appraised the recommendations according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. We identified similarities and discrepancies among recommendations. Results Of 4,077 unique citations, 39 recommendations were identified, of which half described their consensus process. Average scores for the AGREE II domains ranged from 33% to 87%. Cancer risk in RA was addressed in 79% of recommendations, with acknowledgement of increased overall cancer risk. Recommendations did not agree on the safety of using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in RA patients with cancer, except for the contraindication of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients at risk for lymphoma. Most recommendations agreed that RA treatment should be stopped and re-evaluated with a new diagnosis of cancer. Recommendations for patients with a history of cancer differed depending on the drug, cancer type, and time since cancer diagnosis. Few recommendations addressed all issues. Conclusion Recommendations for the treatment of RA in patients with cancer often fail to meet expected methodologic criteria.

This study was performed to describe the characteristics and practices of pharmacists working in family medicine groups (FMGs) and to assess their needs to develop a practice-based network fostering best practices. Methods A Quebec province-wide cross-sectional study was performed from May to August 2018. Pharmacists practising in FMGs were identified through phone calls to all listed FMGs and via direct emails. All identified pharmacists were emailed an invitation to complete an online questionnaire comprising questions to assess their sociodemographic characteristics, to describe their FMG and to assess their needs to reach an optimal practice. The link to the questionnaire was also publicized in a Facebook group of FMG pharmacists and by several professional organizations. A descriptive analysis was performed and discussed with two committees: a working group of FMG pharmacists and an advisory committee comprising key stakeholders. Results and discussion A total of 29 FMG pharmacists were identified, and 17 (59.5%) completed the online questionnaire.

Adaptive capacity refers to the capability of an agent or system to adapt to change, regardless of whether it is examined as an independent social or ecological entity, or as a coupled social–ecological system. Understanding the components of a disturbance and the associated effects to ecosystem services, social systems, and natural resource management increases the ability to adapt to change and ensure continued resilience.

These native bacterial strains were isolated from the filtration unit of a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Before starting the filter operation, the biofilm-forming ability of MC-degraders was evaluated using a unique experimental set-up. The study showed that the MC-LR removal was enhanced by 38% using S + X filter as compared to the uninoculated filter (control). Except for Bacillus sp., MC-degraders in the form of Arthrobacter ramosus and Sphingomonas sp. enhanced the MC removal potential of the native bacterial strains (X) by 10% and 17%, respectively. The central composite design was used to obtain an optimized input parameter (pH, temperature, initial turbidity and retention time) for the filter operation. Various output parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total coliform, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, MC-LR toxicity and ammonia were analyzed to form a well-generalized model with a desirability index of 0.638.

A potential cause for this decline is competitive interactions with domestic honey bees. Urban beekeeping, a fairly new activity, is rapidly gaining popularity. In contrast with agricultural and natural areas, the extent of competition between honey bees and wild bees in urban areas is unclear. The objectives of this study were to quantify the impact of honey bees, urbanization, and the availability of floral resources on wild bee communities. We hypothesized that honey bees exert negative impacts on wild bees, that floral resources favor wild bee communities and mitigate the negative impacts of competition with honey bees, and that the influence of heat islands, used as a proxy for urbanization, varies between wild bees with their functional traits (nesting behavior). We tested these hypotheses with a data set of 19,077 wild bee specimens collected using colored pan-traps at 2 urban sites in 201 and 2013. We investigated community and population patterns after accounting for imperfect detection probability. We found no evidence of competition between wild and domesticated bees. Our analyses indicate mixed effects of urban heat islands across species and positive effects of floral resources. We conclude that cities can allow the coexistence of urban beekeeping and wild bees under moderate hive densities.

Methods Three independent cancer registries were used to retrospectively analyze demographic data from Canadian men diagnosed with penile invasive SCC between 1992 and 2010. The Canadian Census of Population was used to calculate incidence and mortality rates at the province and Forward Sortation Area levels. Results The overall age-adjusted incidence rate was 6.08 cases per million males. Four provinces with statistically significantly higher incidence rates were identified. The national crude incidence rates increased linearly between 1992 and 2010, whereas the age-adjusted incidence rates showed no significant increase during this time period. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate was 1.88 deaths per million males per year. The province of Saskatchewan had significantly higher mortality rates.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate farm management practices such as the bedding materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of recycled manure solids (RMS) as bedding material on bulk tank milk and microbiological implications for cheese quality. Bulk tank samples were collected from 8 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.4 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.1 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the  types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk. However, they might cause organoleptic defects during cheese maturing.",2020-01-01,Journal of Dairy Science,https://openalex.org/V28349394,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16812,128,140,103,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2989424084,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-16812,journal-article,2989424084

In this study, we assessed the ability of tf-fMRI to isolate reproducible networks critical for specific language functions and often damaged in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). First, we performed whole-brain seed-based correlation analyses on tf-fMRI data to identify ICNs anchored in regions known for articulatory, phonological, and semantic processes in healthy male and female controls (HCs). We then evaluated the reproducibility of these ICNs in an independent cohort of HCs, and recapitulated their functional relevance with a post hoc meta-analysis on task-based fMRI. Last, we investigated whether atrophy in these ICNs could inform the differential diagnosis of nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic PPA variants. The identified ICNs included a dorsal articulatory-phonological network involving inferior frontal and supramarginal regions; a ventral semantic network involving anterior middle temporal and angular gyri; a speech perception network involving superior temporal and sensorimotor regions; and a network between posterior inferior temporal and intraparietal regions likely linking visual, phonological, and attentional processes for written language. These ICNs were highly reproducible across independent groups and revealed areas consistent with those emerging from task-based meta-analysis. By comparing ICNs' spatial distribution in HCs with patients' atrophy patterns, we identified ICNs associated with each PPA variant. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of tf-fMRI to investigate the functional status of language networks in patients for whom activation studies can be methodologically challenging.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We showed that a single, short, task-free fMRI acquisition is able to identify four reproducible and relatively segregated intrinsic left-dominant networks associated with articulatory, phonological, semantic, and multimodal orthography-to-phonology processes, in HCs. We also showed that these intrinsic networks relate to syndrome-specific atrophy patterns in primary progressive aphasia.

Some of the respiratory viral infections in chickens pose a significant threat to the poultry industry and public health. In response to viral infections, host innate responses provide the first line of defense against viruses, which often act even before the establishment of the infection.

The present research examined the impact of short-term electives in global health (STEGHs) from the under-represented perspective of host institutions in Benin. METHODS The authors conducted 30 semi-structured interviews from a convenience sample of Beninese health care professionals who had hosted Canadian medical students. Interviewees had previously supervised STEGHs in one of the five different institutions. A subsequent qualitative thematic analysis methodology was used to compilate codes and generate themes. RESULTS Hosting STEGH students motivated respondents to increase their medical knowledge through self-driven learning. They perceived an improvement in the quality of their care and felt a negligible impact on patient safety. They negatively commented on the lack of clear pedagogic objectives that they could rely on. Interviewees think current STEGH partnerships do not advantage them because institutions that send students offer little support during the electives. Furthermore, sending institutions do not offer the same opportunity for local medical students or professionals to take part in such electives outside of Benin. CONCLUSIONS Although host health care professionals evaluated global health electives positively overall, specific improvements could mitigate their negative impacts and help create a more balanced partnership between sending and host institutions. Sending institutions could involve host institutions in curriculum planning. They could invest in building reciprocal elective programmes to receive students from elsewhere.

Bile acid-based block copolymers offers certain advantages for the loading and delivery of siRNA since they can efficiently complex siRNA and bile acids are biocompatible endogenous molecules. In this study, we demonstrate the use of lipids as co-surfactants for the preparation of mixed micelles to improve the siRNA delivery of cholic acid-based block copolymers. Poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGE) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were polymerized on the surface of cholic acid to afford a star-shaped block copolymer with four arms (CA-PAGE-b-PEG)4.

Traditionally, the underlying mechanism of PD has been linked to neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia, however, it does not adequately account for the non-motor symptoms of the disease, suggesting that other brain regions may be involved. One such region is the cerebellum, which is known to be involved, together with the basal ganglia, in both motor and non-motor functions. Many studies have found the cerebellum to be hyperactive in PD patients, a finding that is seldom discussed in detail, and warrants further examination. The current study thus aims to examine quantitively the current literature on the cerebellar involvement in both motor and non-motor functioning in PD. Methods A meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging literature was conducted with Seed-based D mapping. Only the studies testing functional activation in response to motor and non-motor paradigms in PD and healthy controls (HC) were included in the meta-analysis. Separate analyses were conducted by including only studies with non-motor paradigms, as well as meta-regressions with UPDRS III scores and disease duration. Results A total of 38 studies with both motor and non-motor paradigms were included in the meta-analysis, which revealed hyperactivity in Crus I-II and vermal III in PD patients compared to HC. An analysis including only studies with cognitive paradigms revealed a cluster of increased activity in PD patients encompassing lobule VIIB and VIII. The meta-regression with UPDRS III scores found a negative association between motor scores and activation in lobule VI and vermal VII-VIII. No correlation was found with disease duration. Discussion The present findings suggest that one of the main cerebellar implications in PD is linked to cognitive functioning. The negative association between UPDRS scores and activation in regions implicated in motor functioning indicate less involvement of these areas as the disease severity increases. In contrast, the lack of correlation with disease duration seems to indicate that the cerebellar activity may be a compensatory mechanism to the dysfunctional basal ganglia, where certain sub-regions of the cerebellum are employed to cope with motor demands. Future longitudinal studies are needed to fully address this.",2020-02-27,Frontiers in Neurology,https://openalex.org/V96975567,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00127,,,11,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3006829355,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00127,journal-article,3006829355

It also raises ethical, legal and social concerns regarding, for instance, the possible effects of a routinization of prenatal genetic testing on free and informed decision-making by prospective parents, and the role of the state in governing its use. Technological advances are allowing cfDNA analyses to detect an increasing number of genetic risks and conditions in the fetus, potentially further exacerbating such concerns. From May 2015 to December 2016, we conducted a three-round Policy Delphi study (NR = 61, NR = 58, NR = 47; overall retention rate = 77.0%) to explore the social acceptability (SA) of current and potential future uses of NIPT in Canada according to participants with relevant professional, research or advocacy expertise. Participants came from four groups: healthcare professionals (NR3 = 14), social sciences and humanities researchers (NR3 = 13), patients/disability rights advocates (NR3 = 14), and cultural/religious communities advocates (NR3 = 6). This paper presents SA criteria and contextual contingencies relevant to the assessment of NIPT's SA according to the group.

According to them, conditions resulting in severe pain or early death, as well as trisomies (13, 18, 21) and sex chromosome abnormalities, should be covered by Canadian public health insurance. However, there was wide agreement that direct-to-consumer NIPT should be legally banned, and that testing for fetal sex for non-medical reasons using NIPT should be either proscribed or discouraged.

The utility of these molecules is severely threatened by high rates of drug resistance. The ABC transporter MRPA is one of the few key Sb resistance proteins described to date, whose role in detoxification has been thoroughly studied in Leishmania parasites. Nonetheless, its rapid amplification during drug selection complicates the discovery of other mechanisms potentially involved in Sb resistance. In this study, stepwise drug-resistance selection and next-generation sequencing were combined in the search for novel Sb-resistance mechanisms deployed by parasites when MRPA is abolished by targeted gene disruption. The gene mrpA is not essential in L. infantum, and its disruption leads to an Sb hypersensitive phenotype in both promastigotes and amastigotes. Five independent mrpA−/- mutants were selected for antimony resistance. These mutants displayed major changes in their ploidy, as well as extrachromosomal linear amplifications of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 23, which includes the genes coding for ABCC1 and ABCC2. Overexpression of ABCC2, but not of ABCC1, resulted in increased Sb tolerance in the mrpA−/- mutant. SNP analyses revealed three different heterozygous mutations in the gene coding for a serine acetyltransferase (SAT) involved in de novo cysteine synthesis in Leishmania. Overexpression of satQ390K, satG321R and satG325R variants led to a 2–3.2 -fold increase in Sb resistance in mrpA−/- parasites.

Design DNA damage is considered a major threat to the establishment of healthy eggs and embryos. Recent studies found that mouse oocytes with damaged DNA can resume meiosis and undergo germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), but then arrest in metaphase of meiosis I in a process involving spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling. Such a mechanism could help prevent the generation of metaphase II (MII) eggs with damaged DNA. Here, we compared the impact of DNA-damaging agents with nondamaged control samples in mouse and human oocytes. Setting University-affiliated clinic and research center. Patient(s) Patients undergoing ICSI cycles donated GV-stage oocytes after informed consent; 14 human oocytes were collected over  years (from 5 patients aged 27–44 years).

Main Outcome Measure(s) Oocytes were monitored to evaluate GVBD and polar body extrusion (PBE), in addition to DNA damage assessment with the use of γH2AX antibodies and confocal microscopy. Result(s) Whereas DNA damage in mouse oocytes delays or prevents oocyte maturation, most human oocytes harboring experimentally induced DNA damage progress through meiosis I and subsequently form an MII egg, revealing the absence of a DNA damage–induced SAC response.

Using thioflavin-T fluorescence, far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy, we found nontoxic and biocompatible black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) appear to have an exceptional capacity to inhibit insulin aggregation and to disassemble formed mature fibrils, even at an ultralow concentration (100 ng/mL). The inhibition of fibrillation persists at all stages of insulin aggregation and increases PC12 cells survival when exposed to amyloid fibrils. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that BPQDs are able to stabilize the α-helix structure of insulin and obliterate the β-sheet structure to promote the fibril formation.

TSC1 and TSC2 are repressors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of protein synthesis. Dysregulation of mTORC1 in TSC mouse models leads to impairments in excitation-inhibition balance, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits. However, synaptic inhibition arises from multiple types of inhibitory interneurons and how changes in specific interneurons contribute to TSC remains largely unknown. In the present work, we determined the effect of conditional Tsc1 haploinsufficiency in a specific subgroup of inhibitory cells on hippocampal function in mice. Methods We investigated the consequences of conditional heterozygous knockout of Tsc1 in MGE-derived inhibitory cells by crossing Nkx2.1 Cre/wt ; Tsc1 f/f mice. We examined the changes in mTORC1 activity and synaptic transmission in hippocampal cells, as well as hippocampus-related cognitive tasks. Results We detected selective increases in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in interneurons, indicating cell-specific-upregulated mTORC1 signaling. At the behavioral level, Nkx2.1 Cre/wt ; Tsc1 f/wt mice exhibited intact contextual fear memory, but impaired contextual fear discrimination. They displayed intact spatial learning and reference memory but impairment in spatial working memory. Whole-cell recordings in hippocampal slices of Nkx2.1 Cre/wt ; Tsc1 f/wt mice showed intact basic membrane properties, as well as miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, in pyramidal and Nkx2.1-expressing inhibitory cells. Using optogenetic activation of Nkx2.1 interneurons in slices of Nkx2.1 Cre/wt ; Tsc1 f/wt mice, we found a decrease in synaptic inhibition of pyramidal cells. Chronic, but not acute treatment, with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin reversed the impairment in synaptic inhibition. Conclusions Our results indicate that Tsc1 haploinsufficiency in MGE-derived inhibitory cells upregulates mTORC1 activity in these interneurons, reduces their synaptic inhibition of pyramidal cells, and alters contextual fear discrimination and spatial working memory. Thus, selective dysregulation of mTORC1 function in Nkx2.1-expressing inhibitory cells appears sufficient to impair synaptic inhibition and contributes to cognitive deficits in the Tsc1 mouse model of TSC.",2020-05-06,Molecular Autism,https://openalex.org/V1216394,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-020-00340-7,,,11,1,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022134163,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-020-00340-7,journal-article,3022134163

These observations underscore the need for the identification of new biomarkers for the prevention of atherosclerosis, the main underlying cause of CVD. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and lymphatic vessel function are emerging targets in this context. EVs are small vesicles released by cells upon activation or death that are present in several biological tissues and fluids, including blood and lymph. They interact with surrounding cells to transfer their cargo, and the complexity of their biological content makes these EVs potential key players in several chronic inflammatory settings. Many studies focused on the interaction of EVs with the most well-known players of atherosclerosis such as the vascular endothelium, smooth muscle cells and monocytes. However, the fate of EVs within the lymphatic network, a crucial route in the mobilization of cholesterol out the artery wall, is not known. In this review, we aim to bring forward evidence that EVs could be at the interplay between lymphatic function and atherosclerosis by summarizing the recent findings on the characterization of EVs in this setting.",2020-05-25,Frontiers in Physiology,https://openalex.org/V52732750,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00476,,,11,,1,10,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3031902201,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00476,journal-article,3031902201

This article focuses on the redevelopment of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. Since the early 2000s, the formerly neglected and contaminated river has been at the center of extensive regeneration efforts through the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative (AWI). We examine to what extent the AWI has helped to overcome inequities between the two disparate sides of the river. To answer this question, we build on interviews, analysis of planning documents, and site visits.

Some studies have demonstrated a marked impairment of semantic VF compared to phonemic VF in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) is associated with increased risk of conversion to incident AD, it is relevant to examine whether a similar impairment is observed in this population. The objective of the present empirical study is to compare VF performance of aMCI patients to those of AD and elderly controls matched one-to-one for age and education. Method Ninety-six participants divided into three equal groups (N = 32: AD, aMCI and Controls) were included in this study. Participants in each group were, on average, 7 years of age and had 1 years of education. A repeated measures ANOVA with the Group (AD, aMCI, NC) as between-subject factor and the Fluency condition (“P” and “animals”) as within-subject factor was performed. T-tests and simple ANOVAs were also conducted to examine the interaction. Results There was a significant interaction between the groups and the verbal fluency condition. In AD, significantly fewer words were produced in both conditions. In contrast, participants with aMCI demonstrated a pattern similar to controls in the phonemic condition, but generated significantly fewer words in the semantic condition. Conclusion These results indicate a semantic memory impairment in aMCI revealed by a simple, commonly-used neuropsychological test. Future studies are needed to investigate if semantic fluency deficits can help predict future conversion to AD.",2020-01-24,Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology,https://openalex.org/V13265631,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acz018,22,30,35,1,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2963034557,https://doi.org/10.1093/arclin/acz018,journal-article,2963034557

Failure to do so renders the axons vulnerable, leading to eventual degeneration, and neuronal loss. Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanisms by which remyelination or failure to remyelinate occur, particularly in the context of demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders. In multiple sclerosis, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) migrate to lesion sites to repair myelin. However, during disease progression, the ability of OPCs to participate in remyelination diminishes coincident with worsening of the symptoms. Remyelination is affected by a broad range of cues from intrinsic programming of OPCs and extrinsic local factors to the immune system and other systemic elements including diet and exercise. Here we review the literature on these diverse inhibitory factors and the challenges they pose to remyelination.

Assessing synchrony is challenging because many interactive behaviors may be subtlety, if at all, observable in overt behaviors. Physiological measures, therefore, may provide valuable physiological/biological markers of mother–infant synchrony. We have developed a multilevel measurement platform to assess physiological synchrony, attention, and vocal congruency during dynamic face-to-face mother–infant interactions. The present investigation was designed to provide preliminary data on its application in a group of 1 mother–infant dyads (20 subjects) ranging in age from  to 8.5 months at the time of the experimentation. Respiratory kinematics, heart rate, and vocalization were recorded simultaneously from mothers and infants during nonstructured, face-to-face interactions. Novel statistical methods were used to identify reliable moments of synchrony from cross-correlated, mother–infant respiration and to tag infant attention from heart rate deceleration. Results revealed that attention, vocal contingency, and respiratory synchrony are temporally clustered within the dyad interaction. This temporal alignment is consistent with the notion that biological synchrony provides a supportive platform for infant attention and mother–infant contingent vocalization.",2020-01-01,Developmental Psychobiology,https://openalex.org/V119146558,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21913,50,61,62,1,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972268516,https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21913,journal-article,2972268516

We recently developed a clinical method using optical coherence tomography time-lapse imaging and automated choroidal segmentation to measure the pulsatile choroidal volume change (ΔV) and calculate OR using Friedenwald's equation. Here we assess the validity and repeatability of this non-invasive technique. We also propose an improved mathematical model of choroidal thickness to extrapolate ΔV from the pulsatile submacular choroidal thickness change more accurately. The new mathematical model uses anatomical data accounting for the choroid thickness near the equator. The validity of the technique was tested by comparing OR coefficients obtained using our non-invasive method (OROCT) and those obtained with an invasive procedure involving intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (ORIVI) in 1 eyes. Intrasession and intersession repeatability was assessed for 7 and  eyes respectively with two consecutive measurements of OR. Using the new mathematical model, we obtained OR values which are closer to those obtained using the invasive procedure and previously reported techniques. A regression line was calculated to predict the ORIVI based on OROCT, such that ORIVI = 0.65 × OROCT. A strong correlation between OROCT and ORIVI was found, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.85 (p < 0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intrasession and intersession repeatability was 0.925, 95% CI [0.881, 0.953] and 0.950, 95% CI [0.763, 0.990] respectively.

Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory iron-carrying, bifidogenic glycoprotein found in all vertebrates and in mammalian milk, leukocytes and exocrine secretions. Lactoferrin aids in creating an environment for growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, thus reducing colonization with pathogenic bacteria. It is hypothesized that oral bovine lactoferrin (bLF), through its antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, will reduce the rate of mortality or major morbidity in very low birth weight preterm infants. Method Lactoferrin Infant Feeding Trial_Canada (LIFT_Canada) is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized controlled trial with the aim to enroll 50 infants whose data will be combined with the data of the 154 infants enrolled from Lactoferrin Infant Feeding Trial_Australia/New Zealand (LIFT_ANZ) in a pooled intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible infants will be randomized and allocated to one of two treatment groups: 1) a daily dose of 20 mg/kg bLF in breast/donor human milk or formula milk until 3 weeks corrected gestation or for a minimum of  weeks, whichever is longer, or until discharge home or transfer, if earlier; 2) no bLF with daily feeds. The primary outcome will be determined at 36 weeks corrected gestation for the presence of neonatal morbidity and at discharge for survival and treated retinopathy of prematurity. The duration of the trial is expected to be 36 months. Discussion Currently, there continues to be no clear answer related to the benefit of bLF in reducing mortality or any or all of the significant neonatal morbidities in very low birth weight infants.

In cancer associated inflammation, phenotypic heterogeneity has been ascribed to this cell type, whereby neutrophils can manifest anti- or pro-metastatic functions depending on the cellular/micro-environmental context. Here, we demonstrate that pro-metastatic immature low-density neutrophils (iLDNs) more efficiently accumulate in the livers of mice bearing metastatic lesions compared with anti-metastatic mature high-density neutrophils (HDNs). Transcriptomic analyses reveal enrichment of a migration signature in iLDNs relative to HDNs. We find that conditioned media derived from liver-metastatic breast cancer cells, but not lung-metastatic variants, specifically induces chemotaxis of iLDNs and not HDNs. Chemotactic responses are due to increased surface expression of C3aR in iLDNs relative to HDNs. In addition, we detect elevated secretion of cancer-cell derived C3a from liver-metastatic versus lung-metastatic breast cancer cells. Perturbation of C3a/C3aR signaling axis with either a small molecule inhibitor, SB290157, or reducing the levels of secreted C3a from liver-metastatic breast cancer cells by short hairpin RNAs, can abrogate the chemotactic response of iLDNs both in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

METHODS A total of 252 patients underwent aortic arch repair with hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) between 200 and 201 in 1 centres of the Canadian Thoracic Aortic Collaborative. Primary outcomes included mortality; stroke; a composite of mortality or stroke; and a Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined composite (STS-COMP) end point for mortality or major morbidity including stroke, reoperation, renal failure, prolonged ventilation and deep sternal wound infection. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching were performed for cerebral perfusion and nadir temperature practices. RESULTS Antegrade cerebral perfusion was found on multivariable analysis to be protective against mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.86; P = 0.005], stroke (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81; P = 0.006), composite of mortality or stroke (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45–0.72; P = 0.0001) and STS-COMP (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41–0.67; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as compared to HCA alone.

Methods We assessed a cohort of 10 young adults (ages 18–29) born preterm (≤29 weeks of gestation), in comparison to 10 full-term controls. We measured haemoglobin, erythropoietin levels and blood pressure. We also assessed respiratory function using spirometry. Results Compared with controls, tobacco use and sex-adjusted haemoglobin levels were 5.3 (95% CI 2.9 to 7.7) g/L higher in preterm-born individuals, but erythropoietin levels were similar. Duration of oxygen supplementation in the neonatal period was independently associated with higher haemoglobin levels in the preterm group. In young adults born preterm with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, airflow limitation was associated with higher haemoglobin levels.

However, quantitative comparison between repertoires is confounded by variability in the read count of each receptor clonotype due to sampling, library preparation, and expression noise. Here, we present a general Bayesian approach to disentangle repertoire variations from these stochastic effects. Using replicate experiments, we first show how to learn the natural variability of read counts by inferring the distributions of clone sizes as well as an explicit noise model relating true frequencies of clones to their read count. We then use that null model as a baseline to infer a model of clonal expansion from two repertoire time points taken before and after an immune challenge. Applying our approach to yellow fever vaccination as a model of acute infection in humans, we identify candidate clones participating in the response.",2020-04-29,PLOS Computational Biology,https://openalex.org/V86033158,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007873,e1007873,e1007873,16,4,1,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3019459038,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007873,journal-article,3019459038

In this paper, we report that post-transcriptional mechanisms mediated by the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 (STAU1) are essential for the proliferation of non-transformed cells (hTERT-RPE1 and IMR90). Cell sorting quantification and time-lapse video microscopy using FUCCI-hTERT-RPE1 cells identified the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions of the cell cycle as crucial steps for STAU1 functions. The level of expression of 35 transcripts coding for cell-cycle regulators is up- or down-regulated following STAU1 depletion. Among others, expression of E2F1, a transcription factor essential for the G1/S transition, is decreased in STAU1 depleted cells, dependent on a STAU1-binding site in the 3' untranslated region of E2F1 mRNA. Interestingly, E2F1, in turn, increases STAU1 transcription, highlighting a regulatory loop that enhances expression of both STAU1 and E2F1. Our results indicate that a STAU1-mediatedpost-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation controls an mRNA regulon involved in decision making during cell-cycle phase transitions and that this mechanism is essential for cell-cycle progression in non-tumor cells.",2020-06-12,Journal of Molecular Biology,https://openalex.org/V46058472,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.016,3881,3897,432,13,0,9,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3020028727,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.016,journal-article,3020028727

Five adults with PPA completed the protocol. Using an ABA design with multiple baselines, naming performance was compared across four equivalent lists: (1) trained with functional words; (2) trained with words from a picture database; (3) exposed but not trained; and (4) not exposed (control). Treatment was self-administered four times a week for a period of four consecutive weeks. A significant improvement for trained words was found in all five participants, and gains were maintained two months post-treatment in four of them.

These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics' and university administrators' decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field's profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER?

To achieve such impacts, several institutions need to participate; however, health research funding institutions are seldom nominated in the literature as essential players. The attention they have received has so far focused mainly on their role in knowledge translation, informing policy-making and the need to organise health research systems. In this article, we will focus solely on the governance of national health research funding institutions. Our objectives are to identify the main functions of governance for such institutions and actionable governance functions. This research should be useful in several ways, including in highlighting, tracking and measuring the governance trends in a given funding institution, and to forestall low-level governance. Methods First, we reviewed existing frameworks in the grey literature, selecting seven relevant documents. Second, we developed an integrated framework for health research funding institution governance and management. Third, we extracted actionable information for governance by selecting a mix of North American, European and Asian institutions that had documentation available in English (e.g. annual report, legal status, strategy). Results The framework contains 1 functions – 5 dedicated to governance (intelligence acquisition, resourcing and instrumentation, relationships management, accountability and performance, and strategy formulation),  dedicated to management (priority-setting, financing and knowledge transfer), and 5 dedicated to transversal logics that apply to both governance and management (ethics, transparency, capacity reinforcement, monitoring and evaluation, and public engagement).

Among the various complications associated with ANP, acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major contributor leading to high mortality rates associated with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) in human patients. The incidence of ALI/ARDS in ANP dogs is not well-characterized in spontaneous AP and there are no models to study it in rodent models. Most of the data related to AP comes from rodent models of AP, which may not always represent the true mechanisms occurring in the lungs of dogs or humans with ANP. Therefore, this manuscript provides a review of current and potential models to study the role of pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) in acute pancreatitis. Recently, we characterized lung inflammation in clinical cases of AP in dogs and found significant recruitment of PIMs which have been credited as pro-inflammatory cells in species such as cattle, horse, pigs, and sheep that normally have them. Considering the pro-inflammatory roles of constitutive or induced PIMs, we investigated whether a well-established mouse model of ANP has induced PIMs. We found induced PIMs in L-arginine-induced ANP in mouse and that MCP-1 is important in PIM induction in this model. Taken together, now we summarize information on spontaneous ANP in dog and a mouse model of induced ANP to study mechanisms of lung dysfunction and the role of PIMs during ANP.",2020-04-22,Cell and Tissue Research,https://openalex.org/V139399906,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03211-y,207,222,380,2,0,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016750809,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03211-y,journal-article,3016750809

However, this type of model requires constant calibration updates. The objective of this study was to review the calibration of the model used to estimate the real-time Lys requirements of individual growing-finishing pigs. A digestibility trial (n = 10) was conducted to evaluate amino acids digestibility during the growing and finishing phases. Additionally, 12 pigs were used in two 28-day growth experiments conducted as completely randomized design with growing (25 ± 2.1 kg BW, n = 60; 10 pigs per treatment) or finishing barrows (68.1 ±  kg BW, n = 60; 10 pigs per treatment). In each experiment, the pigs were divided into six equal treatment groups and fed 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or 110% of their estimated individual SIDLysR. The Lys requirement of each pig was estimated daily using a real-time model. Body composition was measured with dual-energy X-ray densitometry on day  and 2 of the experiments. Average daily feed intake increased quadratically (P < 0.05) during both growth phases. Maximum average daily gain (ADG) (0.98 kg) and maximum protein deposition (PD; 17 g/day) were observed in growing pigs fed 100% of the estimated SIDLysR (P < 0.001). During the growing period, PD in BW gain (17% to 19%) and N efficiency (52% to 65%) increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing inclusion rates of SID Lys. Finishing pigs had maximum ADG (1.2 kg/day) when they were fed 100% of the requirements. However, the amount of protein in BW gain (13% to 16%) and N efficiency (40% to 55%) increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing inclusion rates of SID Lys. In conclusion, the model proposed for precision feeding is correctly calibrated to predict SIDLysR that maximize PD and ADG of average pigs from 2 to 5 kg BW. Still, there is an opportunity to improve the estimation of SIDLysR and N retention in individual pigs by better representing the individual proportion of protein in BW gain and the factors controlling the efficiency of Lys utilization in individual pigs.",2020-04-22,Animal,https://openalex.org/V66388299,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731120000798,2032,2041,14,10,1,8,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016998145,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731120000798,journal-article,3016998145

The objective of this study was to develop a population-based case-finding strategy to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed airflow obstruction (asthma or COPD) amongst adults with respiratory symptoms in Canada. Methods Adults without a previous history of asthma, COPD or lung disease were recruited using random digit-dialling and asked if they had symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum or wheeze within the past  months. Those who answered affirmatively completed the Asthma Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), COPD-Diagnostic Questionnaire (COPD-DQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Those with an ASQ score of ≥ or a COPD-DQ score of ≥2 underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry to diagnose asthma or COPD. Results 1 11 individuals were contacted at home and assessed for study eligibility. Of the 126 eligible individuals, 91 (72%) enrolled and underwent spirometry. Ultimately, 18 subjects (20% of those enrolled) had obstructive lung disease (73 asthma and 11 COPD). Individuals found to have undiagnosed asthma or COPD had more severe respiratory symptoms and impaired quality of life compared with those without airflow obstruction. The ASQ, COPD-DQ, and CAT had ROC areas for predicting undiagnosed asthma or COPD of 0.49, 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. Four descriptive variables (age, BMI, sex and pack-years smoked) produced better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values than the questionnaires (ROC area=0.68).

This understanding has guided research in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to focus on the misappraisals of intrusions, rather than the intrusions themselves. However, recent evidence suggests that other factors might distinguish intrusions from obsessions, namely the context in which they arise. Indeed, intrusions that occur without direct evidence are related to increased OCD symptoms, obsessive beliefs, and the tendency to confuse reality with the imagination, especially confusing a feared possible self with the person's actual self. However, experimental evidence supporting these findings is lacking, a gap the current study aimed to fill. Five hundred and fifty-seven undergraduate students completed a battery of questionnaires online, which included an experimental task made up of scenarios designed to gauge endorsement in specific intrusions that are either supported or not supported by direct evidence. Results showed that intrusions without direct evidence supporting them uniquely predicted OCD symptoms, whereas intrusions with evidence did not predict OCD symptoms; and that inferential confusion and feared self-perceptions predicted characteristics of the intrusions without direct evidence.

Further, few studies assess all sources of nicotine used by e-cigarette users to assess whether poly-nicotine use relates to nicotine dependence (ND). The objectives were to describe young adult e-cigarette users by: (i) type of e-liquid vaped; (ii) poly-nicotine use; (iii) ND symptoms; and (iv) attempts to quit conventional cigarettes. Methods Data were available in cycle 2 of a longitudinal investigation on the natural course of cigarette smoking and ND. A total of 775 young adults (44% male; mean (SD) age 30.5(1.0)) completed mailed self-report questionnaires in 2017–20. Results Of 775 participants, 14 (19.2%) reported past-year e-cigarette use. Overall, 55.0% of e-cigarette users had used cannabis-containing e-liquid (31.5% vaped cannabis e-liquid exclusively); 50.4% used nicotine-containing e-liquid (23.5% vaped nicotine e-liquid exclusively); and 39.9% used e-liquid without nicotine (8.7% vaped e-liquid without nicotine exclusively). Most e-cigarette users (82.6%) used other nicotine-containing products including conventional cigarettes (72.5%); 60.8% reported ND symptoms, rising to 79.4% among those who vaped nicotine-containing e-liquid. Finally, 29.0% tried to quit conventional cigarettes using e-cigarettes in the past-year, but only 16.7% found them helpful. Conclusions E-cigarettes now appear to appeal to a broader market than smokers who want to quit.

The method uses low energy nanosecond laser (wavelength: 53 nm) pulses to generate a transient microbubble at the distal end of a glass microcapillary supplied with bio-ink. Microbubble expansion results in the ejection of a cell-containing micro-jet perpendicular to the irradiation axis, a method we coined Laser Induced Side Transfer (LIST). We show that the size of the deposited bio-ink droplets can be adjusted between 16 and 32 µm by varying the laser energy. We studied the corresponding jet ejection dynamics and determined optimal conditions for satellite droplet-free bioprinting. We demonstrated droplet bio-printing up to a 3 Hz repetition rate, corresponding to the maximum repetition rate of the used laser. Jet ejection dynamics indicate that LIST can potentially reach 2.5 kHz. Finally, we show that LIST-printed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) present negligible loss of viability and maintain their abilities to migrate, proliferate and form intercellular junctions. Sample preparation is uncomplicated in LIST, while with further development bio-ink multiplexing can be attained.

As such, our study is the first to investigate the impact of age, cohort and period effects in a single study of opinion towards sovereignty in Quebec. We take advantage of an original dataset that includes survey data collected between 198 and 2012. We use these data to examine the impact of age, birth year and survey year on support for this constitutional option among francophone Quebeckers. Our results are in line with previous work: we show that younger Quebeckers are more likely to support sovereignty, and that some cohorts – namely, respondents born between 194 and 195 – are also more likely to favour this option.

We examine the effect of the gravitational fields created by an infinitely long massive cylinder and a rotating spherical mass. In both cases, we show that the degeneracy is again removed thanks to the splitting of the particle's orbitals. The first case would constitute an experimental test - which is quantum mechanical in nature - of the gravitational field of a cylinder. The approach relies on the Newtonian approximation of the gravitational potential created by a cylinder but, in view of self-consistency and for future higher-order approximations, the formalism is based on the full Levi-Civita metric.

Neuroanatomy and physiology,"Molecules present in an animal's environment can indicate the presence of predators, food, or sexual partners and consequently, induce migratory, reproductive, foraging, or escape behaviors. Three sensory systems, the olfactory, gustatory, and solitary chemosensory cell (SCC) systems detect chemical stimuli in vertebrates. While a great deal of research has focused on the olfactory and gustatory system over the years, it is only recently that significant attention has been devoted to the SCC system. The SCCs are microvillous cells that were first discovered on the skin of fish, and later in amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Lampreys also possess SCCs that are particularly numerous on cutaneous papillae. However, little is known regarding their precise distribution, innervation, and function. Here, we show that sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus L.) have cutaneous papillae located around the oral disk, nostril, gill pores, and on the dorsal fins and that SCCs are particularly numerous on these papillae. Tract-tracing experiments demonstrated that the oral and nasal papillae are innervated by the trigeminal nerve, the gill pore papillae are innervated by branchial nerves, and the dorsal fin papillae are innervated by spinal nerves. We also characterized the response profile of gill pore papillae to some chemicals and showed that trout-derived chemicals, amino acids, and a bile acid produced potent responses.

However, current evidence syntheses are limited to a single disorder (e.g., aphasia) and focus on a variety of familiar and unfamiliar communication partners. An understanding of the scope of literature across the evidence-base of acquired neurological populations may provide a better basis to develop interventions and future research tailored for community workers. Aims To explore the scope of literature on paid worker and unfamiliar partner communication training for acquired neurogenic communication disorders with a focus on describing: 1) the types of communication disorders addressed by interventions; 2) the types of learners who received the interventions; 3) the nature of the interventions; and 4) the reported effects on trainees and people with a communication disorder. Methods & procedures A scoping review was conducted. Studies were selected by a systematic keyword search, undertaken through four databases. Eligibility criteria included studies that: (i) reported an intervention directed at paid workers or unfamiliar partners where the primary goal was to improve communication with people with acquired neurogenic communication disorders, (ii) reported original results, (iii) contained quantitative or qualitative data on the effects of the intervention, (iv) were written in English or French and (v) were published in a peer-reviewed journal. The PRISMA-ScR was used to guide design and reporting of the scoping review. Results Seventy publications met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were mostly disorder-specific and addressed communication with people with dementia, aphasia or traumatic brain injury. 15/70 studies examined training programs that were not restructured to a specific population (e.g., aphasia). Learners were mostly working or studying in the healthcare field and only 2/70 studies included community workers without primarily health training. Sixty different interventions were reported and were mostly delivered by speech-language pathologists. Training varied in terms of duration (a few minutes to 46 h) and content, but many shared training methods (e.g., presentation of theory on communication disorders). Nearly all studies demonstrated positive results, 23/26 studies suggested that paid worker and unfamiliar partner communication training may increase the knowledge of trainees, 24/26 studies suggested that it could improve their confidence when interacting with people with a communication disorder and 44/46 studies suggested that it could improve the trainees’ communication abilities. Conclusion A small developing evidence-base exists for communication training programs for paid and unfamiliar communications partners that focuses beyond a single diagnosis or disorder. However, there is very limited knowledge on interventions for community workers from non-health professions.

The key search phrases for identifying potentially relevant articles were (PRF AND joint) OR (PRF AND arthritis) OR (PRF AND arthropathy). The following inclusion criteria were applied for the selection of articles: (1) patients' pain was caused by joint disorders; (2) PRF stimulation was applied to manage joint-origin pain; and (3) after PRF stimulation, follow-up evaluation was performed to assess the reduction in pain intensity. Moreover, joints with more than  reported PRF studies were included in our review.The primary literature search yielded 14 relevant papers. After reading their titles and abstracts and assessing their eligibility based on the full-text articles, we finally included 3 publications in this review. Based on the positive therapeutic outcomes of previous studies, PRF stimulation seems to be an effective treatment for cervical and lumbar facet, sacroiliac, knee, and glenohumeral joint pain. PRF appears to be beneficial. For confirmation of the effectiveness of PRF on joint pain, more high-quality studies are needed.Our review provides insights on the degree of evidence according to pain in each joint, which will help clinicians make informed decisions for using PRF stimulation in various joint pain conditions.",2020-04-01,Pain Practice,https://openalex.org/V72618935,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12863,412,421,20,4,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990479769,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12863,journal-article,2990479769

The result, a clear victory of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) over the Parti libéral du Québec (PLQ), was clearly at odds with the polls. We argue that when the polls get it wrong, it is important to determine whether there was a polling miss , in which the discrepancy is due to changing voter behaviour, or a poll failure , in which the problem stems from polling methodology. Our post-election poll shows that changing voter behaviour—last-minute shifts and the vote of non-disclosers—explains most of the discrepancy. These movements varied by region. We conclude that the Quebec 2018 election was among the worst polling misses in history but not necessarily a major poll failure.",2020-03-01,Canadian Journal of Political Science,https://openalex.org/V195680251,Cambridge University Press,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0008423919000787,133,150,53,1,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2993416551,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0008423919000787,journal-article,2993416551

To compare symptomatic and functional outcomes in homeless v. never homeless FEP, at admission and two years after admission to an Early Psychosis Intervention Service (EIS). From October 200 to April 2011, 16 FEP consecutive admissions (aged 18–30 years old), were recruited in a 2-year prospective longitudinal study in an inner city EIS in Montreal, Canada. Socio-demographic characteristics, symptomatic and functional outcomes, as well as treatments and service use data were collected at admission and annually. 26% of FEP were homeless, prior or during the follow-up. Attrition rate was similar among the two groups. At baseline, the homeless group were more likely to have childhood abuse, forensic history, non-affective psychosis, negative symptoms, substance use disorder and cluster B personality. Despite the intensive care of EIS, the similarity of illness severity at baseline and medication adherence rate, homeless FEP had poorer 2-year symptomatic and functional outcomes, although having more long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI) (vs oral antipsychotics), community treatment order and hospitalizations.

Unfortunately, imaging studies performed after the injury only depict the residual bone fragments position and pattern of spinal cord compression, with little insight on the dynamics involved during traumas. Knowledge of underlying mechanisms could be helpful in determining the severity of the primary injury, hence the extent of spinal cord damage and associated potential for recovery. Finite element models are often used to study dynamic processes, but have never been used specifically to simulate different severities of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Methods Previously developed thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord finite element models were used and further validated, and representative vertebral fragments were modelled. A full factorial design was used to investigate the effects of comminution of the superior fragment, presence of an inferior fragment, fragments rotation and velocity, on maximum Von Mises stress and strain, maximum major strain, and pressure in the spinal cord. Findings Fragment velocity clearly was the most influential factor. Fragments rotation and presence of an inferior fragment increased pressure, but rotation decreased both strains outputs. Although significant for both strains outputs, comminution of the superior fragment isn't estimated to influence outputs. Interpretation This study is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to examine a detailed spinal cord model impacted in situ by fragments from burst fractures. This numeric model could be used in the future to comprehensively link traumatic events or imaging study characteristics to known spinal cord injuries severity and potential for recovery.",2020-02-01,Clinical Biomechanics,https://openalex.org/V74384676,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.12.023,186,194,72,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2998354219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.12.023,journal-article,2998354219

Increases in extreme temperature fluctuations and average temperatures can cause stress, particularly in aquatic sessile ectotherms such as freshwater mussels. However, some species seem to thrive more than others in face of temperature-related stressors. Thermal tolerance may for example explain invasive species success. It is also known that mitochondria can play a key role in setting an ectothermic species’ thermal tolerance. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mitochondrial thermo-tolerance in invasive and endemic freshwater mussels. With the use of high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiration of two freshwater bivalve species exposed to a broad range of temperatures. We noticed that the invasive dreissenid Dreissena bugensis possessed a less thermo-tolerant mitochondrial metabolism than the endemic unionid Elliptio complanata. This lack of tolerance was linked with a more noticeable aerobic metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. This decrease in mitochondrial metabolic activity was also linked with an increase in leak oxygen consumption as well as a stable maintenance of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in both species. These findings may be associated both with species’ life history characteristics, as D. bugensis is more adapted to unstable habitats, in which selection pressures for resistance adaptations are reduced.

Currently used surgical implants do not possess the same tensile properties as intact ACL. Nitinol, a superelastic alloy of nickel and titanium, could be a suitable intra-articular prosthesis. However, its behavior in synovial fluid is unknown. The objectives of this project are to evaluate the corrosion and mechanical properties of Nitinol strands after incubation in synovial fluid. For comparative analysis, Nitinol (Ti-55.97Ni, wt. %) strands fully annealed (n=192) with hard black oxide surface finish were incubated in synovial fluid, physiologic saline (NaCl), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1,  and 6 months. Corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the dissolved content of metallic ions using inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and by characterizing the material surface using scanning electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy. The tensile mechanical properties were evaluated before and after each incubation period. A two-way ANOVA and a Tukey post-hoc tests were used to compare the mean differences between groups. SEM showed mild changes such as increased porosity, with deeper holes and corrosive pits, after 6 months of incubation in synovial fluid. EDS showed similar titanium, nickel and oxide layer distributions and intensities on all surfaces. Ultimate tensile strengths and total elongations were not affected by incubation (p>0.5). However, lower and upper plateau strengths, along with residual elongations, increased slightly following incubation in synovial fluid (p=0.001). These results showed that the incubation of Nitinol in synovial fluid does not significantly affect its surface composition, but induces mild changes in its surface morphology and its mechanical properties. Therefore, Nitinol appears to be safe for intra-articular use.",2020-03-01,Materialia,https://openalex.org/V2898317371,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100567,100567,100567,9,,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000189138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100567,journal-article,3000189138

Copper-based pesticides have long been used for control of microbial diseases on fruit tree productive systems. Although copper is relatively safe from a human health management point of view, it can be accumulated in agricultural soils, affecting soil microbiota and litter degradation. The purpose of this review was to collect the available information to critically discuss the role that litter may play in fruit tree productive systems, in terms of copper incorporation into the soil, where this element is used as a pesticide. To achieve this objective, we focused our review on (1) soil contamination by copper-based pesticides in fruit production systems, (2) soil copper behavior, (3) effects of copper contamination on soil organisms, and (4) copper-litter relation in soil. From this review, we can suggest that (1) litter is the main sink of metals coming from atmospheric fallout because it is a good complexing agent of cations, (2) litter decomposition depends on its quality and in soil microbial activity, and (3) soil and litter microbial activity is negatively affected by soil copper enrichment. Thus, under uncontrolled applications of copper-based pesticides in fruit tree productive systems, copper soil enrichment will generate a decrease in microbial activity, diminishing litter breakdown and decreasing dissolved organic carbon formation. This process will also decrease the soluble copper incorporation into the soil; however, this assumption remains unevaluated.",2020-09-01,Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition,https://openalex.org/V2502518375,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42729-020-00186-1,990,1000,20,3,0,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3005501626,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42729-020-00186-1,journal-article,3005501626

Yet, infection-related migration benefits can result from a combination of environmental and/or social conditions, which can be difficult to disentangle. Here, we focus on two infection-related mechanisms that can favour migration: moving to escape versus recover from infection. By directly comparing the evolution of migration in response to each mechanism, we can evaluate the likely importance of changing abiotic conditions (linked to migratory recovery) with changing social conditions (linked to migratory escape) in terms of infection-driven migration. We built a mathematical model and analysed it using numerically simulated adaptive dynamics to determine when migration should evolve for each migratory recovery and social migratory escape. We found that a higher fraction of the population migrated under migratory recovery than under social migratory escape. We also found that two distinct migratory strategies (e.g. some individuals always migrate and others only occasionally migrate) sometimes coexisted within populations with social migratory escape, but never with migratory recovery. Our results suggest that migratory recovery is more likely to promote the evolution of migratory behaviour, rather than escape from infected conspecifics (social migratory escape).",2020-06-01,Journal of Animal Ecology,https://openalex.org/V33456383,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13195,1448,1457,89,6,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3009928087,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13195,journal-article,3009928087

Our balanced design systematically controlled for target word (noun vs. verb) and the context immediately preceding it. Group results from 3 native speakers of Quebec French revealed that, up to 30 ms, ERPs elicited by syntactic category violations were comparable with ERP responses to correct sentences, showing that there is no early activation reflecting syntactic category identification. Instead, in response to all anomalous conditions, we observed an N400 followed by a P600. Combined anomalies yielded additive effects of syntactic category and lexical-semantic anomalies on the N400, and a large P600 effect similar to the one observed in the pure syntactic condition. These results provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that (i) syntactic categories are processed first, and (ii) that syntactic category errors ""block"" lexical-semantic processing. Further, the N400 effect in response to pure syntactic category violations reflects a mismatch detection between a predicted word-stem and the actual target. This mechanism takes place simultaneously (and potentially in parallel) with lexical-semantic processing. In contrast, an interaction of syntax and semantics for the P600 reveals that the same neurocognitive resources are recruited for syntactic and semantic integration, both promoted by the implementation of an acceptability judgement task in our design. Additional analyses of individual data complemented these observations: during sentence processing, participants did not rely on one single cognitive mechanism reflected by either the N400 or the P600 effect but on both, suggesting that the biphasic N400-P600 ERP wave can indeed be considered to be an index of phrase-structure violations in most individuals, at least if they are realized on content words.",2020-03-13,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229169,e0229169,e0229169,15,3,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012287041,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229169,journal-article,3012287041

It was proposed that rs5758550, located 116 kb downstream of the CYP2D6 gene locus, increases gene expression and thus contributes to variability in CYP2D6 activity. This finding has, however, not been validated. The purpose of the study was to address a major technological barrier, i.e., experimentally linking rs5758550, also referred to as the ""enhancer"" single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), to CYP2D6 haplotypes >100 kb away. To overcome this challenge is essential to ultimately determine the contribution of the ""enhancer"" SNP to interindividual variability in CYP2D6 activity.A large ethnically mixed population sample (n=3,162) was computationally phased to determine linkage between the ""enhancer"" SNP and CYP2D6 haplotypes (or star alleles). To experimentally validate predicted linkages, DropPhase2D6, a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)-based method was developed. 10X Genomics Linked-Reads were utilized as a proof of concept.Phasing predicted that the ""enhancer"" SNP can occur on numerous CYP2D6 haplotypes including CYP2D6*1, *2, *5, and *41 and suggested that linkage is incomplete, i.e., a portion of these alleles do not have the ""enhancer"" SNP. Phasing also revealed differences among the European and African ancestry data sets regarding the proportion of alleles with and without the ""enhancer"" SNP. DropPhase2D6 was utilized to confirm or refute the predicted ""enhancer"" SNP location for individual samples, e.g., of n=3 samples genotyped as *1/*41, rs5758550 was on the *41 allele of two samples and on the * allele of one sample. Our findings highlight that the location of the ""enhancer"" SNP must not be assigned by ""default."" Furthermore, linkage between the ""enhancer"" SNP and CYP2D6 star allele haplotypes was confirmed with 10X Genomics technology.Since the ""enhancer"" SNP can be present on a portion of normal, decreased, or no function alleles, the phase of the ""enhancer"" SNP must be considered when investigating the impact of the ""enhancer"" SNP on CYP2D6 activity.",2020-05-08,Frontiers in Pharmacology,https://openalex.org/V132108250,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00486,,,11,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3020879553,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00486,journal-article,3020879553

This study reviewed existing MSK APP competency frameworks and education offerings, and explored physiotherapist learning needs with a view to informing international standardisation of MSK APP education curricula. A scoping review of the literature and relevant university and regulatory websites identified APP competency frameworks and education curricula, which were verified by international experts. Content analysis, performed on the identified competencies and modules, produced a list of themes existing in MSK advanced practice internationally. A survey based on those themes identified the learning priorities of physiotherapists (n = 25) participating in an APP symposium in Ireland. Six APP competency frameworks and eleven curricula from the UK, Canada and Australia were identified. Themes emerging, regarding MSK APP practice internationally, included both entry-level physiotherapy (e.g., Assessment and Diagnosis) and traditionally medically-controlled tasks (e.g., Injection Therapy) , as well as Research, Leadership, Service Development, Professional-related Matters and Education .

Identification of kinematic strategies that enhance performance and reduce risks of practice-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMD) represents an important research topic since more than half of professional pianists might suffer from PRMD during their career. Studies in biomechanics have highlighted the benefits of using proximal upper-limb joints to reduce the load on distal segments by effectively creating velocity and force at the finger-key interaction. If scientific research has documented postural and expressive features of pianists' trunk motion, there is currently a lack of scientific evidence assessing the role of trunk motion in sound production and in injury prevention. We address this gap by integrating motion of the pelvis and thorax in the analysis of both upper-limb linear velocities and joint angular contribution to endpoint velocities. Specifically, this study aims to assess kinematic features of different types of touch and articulation and the impact of trunk motion on these features. Twelve pianists performed repetitive loud and slow-paced keystrokes. They were asked to vary (i) body implication (use of trunk and upper-limb motion or use of only upper-limb motion), (ii) touch (struck touch, initiating the attack with the fingertip at a certain distance from the key surface, or pressed touch, initiating the attack with the fingertip in contact with the key surface), and (iii) articulation (staccato, short finger-key contact time, or tenuto, sustained finger-key contact time). Data were collected using a 3D motion capture system and a sound recording device. Results show that body implication, touch, and articulation modified kinematic features of loud keystrokes, which exhibited not only downward but also important forward segmental velocities (particularly in pressed touch and staccato articulation). Pelvic anterior rotation had a prominent role in the production of loud tones as it effectively contributed to creating forward linear velocities at the upper limb. The reported findings have implications for the performance, teaching, and research domains since they provide evidence of how pianists' trunk motion can actively contribute to the sound production and might not only be associated with either postural or expressive features.",2020-06-10,Frontiers in Psychology,https://openalex.org/V9692511,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01159,,,,,1,7,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3035004561,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01159,journal-article,3035004561

We aimed to investigate whether sedentary behavior or sleep predicted lipid profiles in children over a 2-year period. Six hundered and thirty children from the QUALITY cohort, with at least one obese parent, were assessed prospectively at ages 8–10 and 10–12 years. Measures of sedentary behavior included self-reported TV viewing and computer/video game use. Seven-day accelerometry was used to derive sedentary behavior and sleep duration. Adiposity was assessed using DEXA scans. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls yielded estimates of carbohydrate and fat intake. Outcomes included fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol. Multivariable models were adjusted for adiposity and diet. At both Visit 1 (median age 9.6 year) and Visit  (median age 11.6 year), children were of normal weight (55%), overweight (22%), or obese (22%). Every additional hour of TV viewing at Visit 1 was associated with a 7.0% triglyceride increase (95% CI: 3.5, 10.6; P < 0.01) and 2.6% HDL decrease (95% CI: −4.2, −0.9; P < 0.01) at Visit 2; findings remained significant after adjusting for adiposity and diet. Every additional hour of sleep at Visit 1 predicted a 4.8% LDL decrease (95% CI: −9.0, −0.5; P = 0.03) at Visit 2, after adjusting for fat intake; this association became nonsignificant once controlling for adiposity.

At the molecular level, the regulation of circadian rhythms is under the control of transcriptional-translational feedback loops composed of clock factors, including transcription factors. In the brain, synaptic plasticity has been shown to vary with a 24-h rhythm. Also, when measured at a given time-of-day, synaptic plasticity has been observed to be disrupted by dysregulation of clock factors. This could suggest a regulation of synaptic functions by the clock machinery. Interestingly, many studies provide support for direct and indirect transcriptional regulation by core clock factors, including rhythmic gene expression, for a variety of synaptic components. Indeed, the gene of several neuropeptides, neurotransmitter regulators, receptors and transporters, ion channels, vesicle proteins, and adhesion and scaffolding molecules present evidence to be clock-controlled.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A single Level  trauma center specialized in SCI care. Participants: 15 individuals sustaining an acute TSCI. Interventions: Not applicable. Outcome Measures: The total inpatient functional rehabilitation length of stay. The occurrence of medical complications and the discharge destination from the inpatient functional rehabilitation facility were also considered. Results: 63.3% of the cohort presented signs and/or symptoms of spasticity during acute care. Individuals with early spasticity developed medical complications during acute care and during intensive functional rehabilitation in a higher proportion. They were also hospitalized significantly longer and were less likely to return home after rehabilitation than individuals without early spasticity. Early spasticity was an independent factor associated with increased total inpatient rehabilitation length of stay.

The aim of this study is to examine factors influencing trajectories of poker players. The results are based on data collected at a four-time measurement of a prospective cohort study conducted in Quebec (n = 304 poker players). A latent class growth analysis was performed to identify trajectories based on the Problem Gambling Severity Index score. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlates of gambling trajectories. Over the 3 years of the study, three gambling problem trajectories were identified, comprising one decreasing trajectory (1st: non-problematic—diminishing), one stable trajectory (2nd: low risk—stable), and one increasing trajectory (3th: problem gamblers—increasing). Internet as the main poker form and number of game played were associated with at-risk trajectories. Depression symptoms were significant predictors of the third trajectory whereas impulsivity predicted the second trajectory. This study shows that the risk is remaining low over years for the vast majority of poker players. However, the vulnerable poker players at the beginning of the study remain on a problematic increasing trajectory.

Within the SEER database (1998–2015), 2282 stage I–III SCCP patients were identified. Conditional survival estimates were used to calculate cancer-specific mortality (CSM) after event-free survival intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years. Multivariable Cox regression models predicted CSM according to event-free survival. After PTE, 5-year CSM-free rate was 78.0% and increased to 84.6%, 88.1%, 92.0%, and 94.2% in patients who survived ≥ 1, ≥ 2, ≥ 3, and ≥ 5 years. After stratification according to tumour characteristics, 5-year CSM-free rates increased from 85.9 to 95.4%, 79.0 to 97.1%, 78.9 to 90.0%, and from 54.5 to 86.0% in those survived ≥ 5 years, respectively, in T1N0, T2N0, T3N0, and N1-2 patients.

We also know that maternal depression in the child's early years has long-term associations with child development. However, the moderating role of childcare quality on long-term associations between maternal depression and child outcome has not been thoroughly investigated. This article examined longitudinal associations between probable maternal depression (PMD) during early childhood (0-5 years) and childcare quality on children's emotional and behavioral development at the age of 7-8 years (N = 207). Childcare quality was evaluated through observations within the settings. PMD during early childhood was assessed using complementary information from interviews conducted with the mother and current maternal symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were reported by the mother, father and the child at age 7-8 years. Results indicate that when mothers reported clinically relevant depression in early childhood, 7-8-year-old children demonstrate fewer behavioral problems if they attended a higher quality childcare setting.

Our findings show that Aβ deposition single-handedly predicts poorer episodic memory performance and that Aβ and WMHs contribute additively to poorer performance in working memory and language while carrying synergistic associations with executive functions and attention. Through mediation modeling, we demonstrated that the influence of age over episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, and language is fully mediated by brain pathology.

There is also a tendency for legislators to regulate in silos—that is, in discrete fields of scientific activity without due regard to the need to make new knowledge as generalisable as possible. There are myriad challenges for the stakeholders—researchers and regulators alike—who attempt to navigate these landscapes. This Delphi study was undertaken in order to provide the first interdisciplinary and crosscutting analysis of health research regulation, as it is experienced by such stakeholders in the UK context. As well as reinforcing existing understandings of the regulatory environment, Delphi participants called for greater collaboration, and even co-production, of processes involved in health research regulation. On the basis of this research, we offer insights about how health research regulation can become a matter with which a wider range of stakeholders—including researchers, regulators, publics and research sponsors—can engage. The evidence supports the normative claim that health research regulation should continue to move away from strict, prescriptive rules-based approaches, and towards flexible principle-based regimes that allow researchers, regulators and publics to co-produce regulatory systems serving core principles. By unpacking thorny concepts and practices at the heart of health research regulation—including the public interest and public engagement—our results have the potential to situate and breathe life into them. The results also demonstrate that while proportionality is well-recognised as a crucial element of flexible regulatory systems, more must be done to operationalise this as an ethical assessment of the values and risks at stake at multiple junctures in the research trajectory. This is required if we are to move beyond proportionality as a mere risk-management tool. Compliance culture no longer accurately reflects the needs and expectations of researchers or regulators, nor does it necessarily produce the best research.

To determine the contribution of gas-exchanging alveolar type  (AT1) and surfactant-secreting type 2 (AT2) cells to stretch-induced ATP release, we used quantitative real-time luminescence ATP imaging and rat primary alveolar cells cultured on silicon substrate for 2– days. When cultured on solid support, primary AT2 cells progressively transdifferentiated into AT1-like cells with ~20% of cells showing AT1 phenotype by day 2– (AT2:AT1 ≈ 4:1), while on day 7, the AT2:AT1 cell ratio was reversed with up to 80% of the cells displaying characteristics of AT1 cells. Stretch (1 s, 5–35%) induced ATP release from AT2/AT1 cell cultures, and it was highest on days 2 and  but declined in older cultures. ATP release tightly correlated with the number of remaining AT2 cells in culture, consistent with ~10-fold lower ATP release by AT1 than AT2 cells. ATP release was unaffected by inhibitors of putative ATP channels carbenoxolone and probenecid but was significantly diminished in cells loaded with calcium chelator BAPTA. These pharmacological modulators had similar effects on stretch-induced intracellular Ca 2+ responses measured by Fura2 fluorescence. The study revealed that AT2 cells are the primary source of stretch-induced ATP release in heterocellular AT2/AT1 cell cultures, suggesting similar contribution in intact alveoli.

Using data from 1101 young adults from Montreal (Canada) who participated in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking (ISIS), we compare the social gradients in the presence of health-related resources located (i) within uniform areas (defined as circular buffers and road-network buffers) around participants' place of residence; and (ii) within participants' self-defined neighbourhoods. Social inequalities in accessibility to a diversity of health-related resources (grocery stores, fruit and vegetable stores, eating and drinking places, recreational sports centres, civic, social, and fraternal organizations, bike paths, parks, social services, libraries, dental offices, physician offices) were more pronounced in self-defined neighbourhoods than in uniform buffer areas.

Interspecies allometric scaling was applied to predict the toxicokinetic (TK) parameters of BPS, namely plasma clearance in humans from values obtained in animals, and thus contribute to assessment of the human internal exposure to BPS. Allometric scaling was performed using mean BPS plasma clearance values measured in rats after intravenous administration of  mg BPS /kg body weight (BW) and those previously obtained in piglets and sheep using identical IV BPS dosing and analytical procedures. The BPS plasma clearance, evaluated at 0.92 L/kg.h in rats, was proportional to species body weight, enabling the prediction of human BPS plasma clearance by extrapolating to a BW of 7 kg. The estimated BPS plasma clearance in humans was thus 0.92 L/min (0.79 L/kg.h), i.e. about two times lower than the previously estimated BPA clearance (1.79 L/min). By increasing systemic exposure to the active moiety of an environmental estrogenic chemical, this less efficient clearance of BPS in humans, as compared with BPA, might worsen the harmful consequences of replacing BPA by BPS.",2020-01-01,Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology,https://openalex.org/V42307217,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2019.114845,114845,114845,386,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990079831,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2019.114845,journal-article,2990079831

This study compared the results from this system with those of professional subjective refraction. Participant visual comfort and preference of results were also measured. METHODS Thirty-six optometry-naive participants (n = 3 eyes, aged 18-35 years), were randomly subjected to three refraction methods: professional subjective refraction, unassisted Netra (participants alone) and refined Netra (sphere results refined by a practitioner). Using a randomised, double-blind design, refraction results were mounted in a trial frame and distance logMAR visual acuities were measured. Subjective appreciation and visual comfort were assessed by questionnaire. Overall preference was ranked. RESULTS Unassisted Netra yielded a median myopic overcorrection of 0.6 D (interquartile range [IQR] 0.2 to 0.94) compared to professional subjective refraction. Median equivalent sphere with unassisted Netra (-1.40 D, IQR -3.10 to -0.90) was significantly more myopic than refined Netra (-0.7 D, IQR -1.60 to -0.30) and then subjective refraction (-0.8 D, IQR -1.60 to -0.30) (all p-values < 0.01). Median visual acuity with professional subjective refraction (-0.16, IQR -0.2 to -0.09) was superior than unassisted Netra (-0.08, IQR -0.2 to 0.03) (p < 0.01). Subjective refraction was ranked first in preference of trial framed results by 7 per cent of participants; median preference rank favoured professional subjective refraction to both Netra results (all p < 0.01). For all questionnaire items, visual comfort was higher with subjective refraction than with unassisted Netra (all p < 0.04). CONCLUSION The Netra device - especially when used without professional assistance and compared to subjective refraction - induces significant myopic overcorrection and lower levels of visual acuity, subjective preference and visual comfort.",2020-07-01,Clinical and Experimental Optometry,https://openalex.org/V110643388,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1111/cxo.13003,501,506,103,4,0,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2990355103,https://doi.org/10.1111/cxo.13003,journal-article,2990355103

Despite the importance of TTC estimation in our everyday life, few studies have been conducted on it, and there are still a lot of unanswered questions and unknown aspects of this issue. In this study, we intended to address one of these unknown aspects. We used independent component analysis to systematically assess EEG substrates associated with TTC estimation using two experiments: (1) transversal motion experiment (when a moving object passes transversally in the frontoparallel plane from side to side in front of the observer), and (2) head-on motion experiment (when the observer is on the motion path of the moving object). We also studied the energy of all EEG sources in these two experiments. The results showed that brain regions involved in the transversal and head-on motion experiments were the same. However, the energy used by some brain regions in the head-on motion experiment, including some regions in left parietotemporal and left frontal lobes, was significantly higher than the energy used by those regions in the transversal motion experiment.

The site offers an excellent opportunity to compare two distinct Protoaurignacian levels yielding well-documented and well-dated deposits. Previous studies of spatial, lithic, and raw material data from these two Protoaurignacian levels have revealed distinct mobility signatures as well as undeniable evidence for the resilience of the Protoaurignacian technocomplex during episodes of climatic instability including the HE4 event, circa 40ka cal BP. The highly fragmented nature of the animal bones at the site warrants the application of the ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) collagen fingerprinting technique.

We here analyzed the effect of CD36 deficiency on retinal inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration, the hallmarks of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), that characterize Cx3cr1-/-mice. Methods: We analyzed subretinal MP accumulation, and cone- and rod-degeneration in light-challenged and aged, CD36 competent or deficient, hyper-inflammatory Cx3cr1-/- mice, using histology and immune-stained retinal flatmounts. Monocytes (Mo) were subretinally adoptively transferred to evaluate their elimination rate from the subretinal space and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion from cultured Mo-derived cells (MdCs) of the different mouse strains were analyzed. Results: CD36 deficient Cx3cr1-/- mice were protected against age- and light-induced subretinal inflammation and associated cone and rod degeneration. CD36 deficiency in Cx3cr1-/- MPs inhibited their prolonged survival in the immune-suppressive subretinal space and reduced the exaggerated IL-6 secretion observed in Cx3cr1-/- MPs that we previously showed leads to increased subretinal MP survival. Conclusion:Cd36 deficiency significantly protected hyperinflammatory Cx3cr1-/- mice against subretinal MP accumulation and associated photoreceptor degeneration. The observed CD36-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory IL-6 might be at least partially responsible for the prolonged MP survival in the immune-suppressive environment and its pathological consequences on photoreceptor homeostasis.",2020-01-08,Frontiers in Immunology,https://openalex.org/V2595292759,Frontiers Media SA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969887/,3032,3032,10,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3000415356,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.03032,journal-article,3000415356

Trotter] is an important crop in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, where it is a staple food for over 60 million people. However, the productivity of tef remains extremely low in part due to its susceptibility to lodging. Lodging is the displacement of the plant from the upright position, and it is exacerbated by rain, wind and the application of fertilizer. In order to address the issue of global food security, especially in the Horn of Africa, greater insight into the causes of tef lodging is needed. In this study, we combine modeling and biomechanical measurements to compare the properties relating to lodging tolerance in high yielding, improved tef genotypes, and lower yielding natural landraces. Our results indicate that the angle of the panicle contributes to the likelihood of lodging in tef. Varieties with compact panicles and reduced height had increased lodging resistance compared to the other varieties. By comparing different varieties, we found that overall, the landraces of tef lodged less than improved varieties. We constructed a model of stem bending and found that panicle angle was an important determinant of the amount of lodging.

In other words, vascular dysfunction affects brain structure and function, and leads to cognitive failure. This is gathered under the term Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID). One of the main culprits in the occurrence of cognitive decline could be the inevitable rise in arterial pulse pressure due to the age-dependent stiffening of large conductance arteries like the carotids, which in turn, could accentuate the penetration of the pulse pressure wave deeper into the fragile microvasculature of the brain and damage it.

Amongst this subset, contracting the muscles surrounding the eyes (orbicularis oculi muscle) is the most frequent response and has been linked specifically to pain intensity, a fundamental aspect of the sensory dimension of pain. To further explore this link, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that orbicularis oculi activation during pain reflects the magnitude of brain responses in areas being involved in processing the sensory dimension of pain. Facial and brain (BOLD) responses to experimentally-induced heat pain applied to the left lower leg were assessed in twenty-two healthy participants after verbal suggestions were given to specifically increase perceived pain intensity and in control conditions involving no suggestion. Increases in pain intensity produced the expected changes in facial responses characterized by a stronger contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle. A regression model further demonstrated that stronger increases in orbicularis oculi activity reflected a larger increase in the BOLD response to the noxious stimulus in the leg area of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and a larger decrease in medial prefrontal activity consistent with previous finding suggesting disinhibition. Importantly, the positive coupling of orbicularis oculi with S1 activity was not accounted for by changes in other facial muscles. These results are consistent with the notion that facial expressions of pain differentially encode the multi-dimensional pain experience and reflect, at least partly, the activity of the spino-thalamo-cortical pathway targeting the primary somatosensory cortex.",2020-08-15,NeuroImage,https://openalex.org/V103225281,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116885,,,,,1,6,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3023233993,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116885,journal-article,3023233993

First, we review the influence of the gravitational field of the Earth on the quantum Hall effect. Taking the gravitational field of the Earth to be uniform along the vertical direction, we compute the affected quantized Hall resistivity. Then, we investigate how the gravitational field modifies the Landau levels of a particle moving between two massive hemispheres in the presence of a constant and uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion. We find that the familiar degeneracy of the Landau levels is removed and the spacing between the latter becomes dependent on the mass density of the hemispheres and on the gravitational constant $G$. We use this result to show that the quantum Hall effect in a thin conductor, sandwiched between two massive hemispheres, should yield a slightly different variation of the Hall resistivity with the applied magnetic field. We then argue that the well-known problem of the gravitationally induced electric field, that might a priori be thought to hinder the effect of gravity, has actually a beneficial role as it amplifies the latter.

Notably, it remains unclear whether observed interaction patterns between two trophic groups are a result of (a) preferential partner selection between groups, or (b) species interactions within groups. We conducted an experiment in order to disentangle these two drivers, using the plant–mycorrhizal symbiosis as a model system. We followed mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots growing either with or without neighbours. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of interaction within trophic groups (here, plant-to-plant interactions) on ecological network assembly. Results showed that plants were not equally affected by the presence of neighbours and that network nestedness was higher when plants grew without neighbours. We also found a poor correlation between the centrality (i.e., standardized number of interactions) of plant species grown in communities and those grown without neighbours, while the reverse was true for mycorrhizal fungi. This suggests that the optimum level of specificity or generalism in mycorrhizal selection is not a fixed plant trait, but a plastic, context-dependent one. Synthesis. Our results show that ecological networks are not only shaped by preferential partner selection, but also by interactions within a given trophic group. This finding should be considered in future modelling exercises on ecological network dynamics. Moreover, our nestedness results suggest that in the presence of multiple host plants, mycorrhizal fungi display preferences for specific interactions, suggesting that local plant diversity may shape mycorrhizal fungal community structure.",2020-01-01,Journal of Ecology,https://openalex.org/V11271929,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13230,366,377,108,1,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2950746546,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13230,journal-article,2950746546

However, it is less sensitive in normal-sized LNs. This study was performed in order to define the prevalence of mediastinal LN metastases discovered on combined endosonography by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) fine needle aspiration in patients with a radiologically normal mediastinum. This study consists of a retrospective, single-institution, tertiary care referral center review of a prospectively maintained database. Patients were identified from a cohort between January 200 and December 2014. One hundred and sixty-one patients with biopsy-proven, non-small-cell lung cancer were identified in whom both the preendosonography CT and PET-CT were negative for mediastinal LN metastases. Combined endosonography (EBUS + EUS-FNA) was performed in all patients. Z test was used for statistical analysis. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 161 consecutive patients were included. Patients were staged if they had central tumor, tumor size >3 cm, N1 lymph node involvement on PET-CT/CT, or if there was low SUV (<2.5) in the primary tumor. A total of 41 lymph nodes were biopsied in the 161 patients using combined endosonography; 14 with EBUS and 26 with EUS. Mean and median number of lymph nodes biopsied per patient using combined EBUS/EUS was 2.5 and 3, respectively (mean and median EBUS: 0.91 and 2.5; mean and median EUS 1.6 and 3). Endosonographic staging upstaged 13% of patients with radiologically normal lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hilum, lobar, and sublobar regions (confidence interval 8.22-19.20). Twenty-one out of 161 patients (13%) with radiologically normal mediastinum were positive on combined EBUS/EUS staging. Out of 2 patients upstaged on endosonography, 1 (71%) had tumor size >3 cm. Six (28%) had occult N1 disease. Thirteen (61%) had occult N disease and  (9%) had adrenal involvement. None of the upstaged patients had N1 LN involvement on PET-CT or CT scan.

We sought to establish the feasibility of a trial designed to address this question. Materials and methods The Endovascular Acute Stroke Intervention (EASI) study was a single-centre randomized trial comparing EVT to medical therapy for large-vessel occlusion stroke. Patients with TL receiving EVT were randomly allocated to acute c-ICA stenting or no stenting. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2 at 90 days. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) at 24 hours and mortality at 90 days. Results Of 30 patients included in EASI between 201 and 2018, 2 (8.0%) with TL were randomly allocated to acute stenting (n = 13) or no stenting (n = 11). Baseline characteristics were balanced. Eight (61.5%; 95% CI 35.5%–82.3%) and  (63.6%; 95% CI 35.4%–84.9%) patients, respectively, had a favorable outcome (mRS 0–2; P = 1.0). One non-stented patient had a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions This pilot trial of patients with TL undergoing EVT suggests that a sufficiently powered larger TL trial comparing acute c-ICA stenting to no stenting is feasible.

Previous studies have harnessed this effect to probe the distant Universe at ultraviolet, optical, infrared and millimetre wavelengths1–6. However, strong-lensing studies of young, star-forming galaxies have never extended into X-ray wavelengths, which uniquely trace high-energy phenomena. Here, we report an X-ray detection of star formation in a highly magnified, strongly lensed galaxy. This lensed galaxy, seen during the first third of the history of the Universe, is a low-mass, low-metallicity starburst with elevated X-ray emission, and is a likely analogue to the first generation of galaxies. Our measurements yield insight into the role that X-ray emission from stellar populations in the first generation of galaxies may play in reionizing the Universe. This observation paves the way for future strong-lensing-assisted X-ray studies of distant galaxies reaching orders of magnitude below the detection limits of current deep fields, and previews the depths that will be attainable with future X-ray observatories.

There is now growing evidence suggesting that this technology may have emerged from already operational material instead of being a sudden innovation. Sharing ideas and thoughts with conspecifics via language constitutes an amazing ability, but what value would it hold if our conspecifics were not first detected and recognized? Conspecific voice (CV) perception is fundamental to communication and widely shared across the animal kingdom. Two questions that arise then are: is this apparently shared ability reflected in common cerebral substrate? And, how has this substrate evolved? The paper addresses these questions by examining studies on the cerebral basis of CV perception in humans' closest relatives, non-human primates. Neuroimaging studies, in particular, suggest the existence of a ‘voice patch system’, a network of interconnected cortical areas that can provide a common template for the cerebral processing of CV in primates.

This paper presents results from a before-and-after study examining the effects of rehousing, i.e., relocating to a newly constructed or pre-existing social housing unit, on psychosocial health and asthma-related symptoms for Inuit adults. Baseline data were collected 1–6 months before, and follow-up data 15–18 months after rehousing. Of the 28 participants at baseline, 18 were rehoused.

Self-reported health measures included psychological distress, perceived stress in daily life, perceived control over one’s life, and asthma-related symptoms. Data are analyzed using multilevel models for longitudinal data. After adjusting for age, sex, and region of residence, participants reported significantly lower levels of psychological distress and perceived stress in daily life, and improved sense of control over their lives 1 to 18 months after rehousing. Participants were also significantly less likely to report asthma-related symptoms at follow-up.

However, non-destructive in situ approaches to assess quantitatively the features of SAV beds and their effects on zooplankton community are still lacking. This study aims to: 1) estimate SAV cover and complexity using subaquatic upward photographs (SUP) and 2) analyse the relationship between SAV variables and crustacean zooplankton composition and functional diversity (FD). SAV biomass and zooplankton were sampled at 52 stations in a large fluvial lake. Two metrics based on SUP were used to quantify SAV cover and complexity: 1) the percentage of the underwater landscape occupied by SAV (PLAND: SAV cover), and 2) its perimeter-area fractal dimension (PAFRAC: SAV complexity). Zooplankton composition and functional diversity were estimated based on crustacean species assemblages and functional traits. We used linear models to describe the relationships between SAV indices , environmental variables and zooplankton abundance, biomass and FD. SUP was an effective method to estimate in situ SAV cover and complexity. PLAND and PAFRAC were positively related to SAV biomass and zooplankton abundance, yielding a non-destructive assessment of the SAV-zooplankton relationships. Our study partially supports the habitat complexity-ecological niche availability hypothesis, as SAV cover and complexity influenced zooplankton functional groups and diversity indices.

However, despite this interest, most of the coating deposition techniques used thus far are not suitable for large-scale production because of their multistep nature. In this regard, the use of atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharges (AP-DBD) operated under a controlled N2/N2O atmosphere offers a promising alternative to conventional deposition techniques for the fabrication of anti-fogging coatings. Using this one-step coating approach, four siloxane precursors with different structures and different number of Si―H and Si−CH3 groups; namely, 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO), and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) were deposited on glass samples. Because of their extreme wetting behavior (WCA O, O  C O, and Si OH groups, the relatively high surface roughness of TMCTS-coated glass, compared with that of OMCTS-, TMDSO-, or HMDSO-coated glass, accounted for its superior visual characteristics when exposed to water vapor at 80 °C.

Yet, students presenting various behavior and social problems—including externalizing and internalizing behaviors, as well as social problems with peers and teachers—may feel that these psychological needs are not fulfilled, which, in turn, would lead to lower engagement in the classroom. This study aims to assess if students presenting one of five possible profiles of cooccurring externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, and social problems are more likely than students without problems to report a lower sense of competence and relatedness which would act as mediators leading to lower behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Path analyses and bootstrapping conducted among a sample of 582 fifth- and sixth-grade students, show that sense of relatedness to school mediated the links between having any type of behavior and social problems profile and later lower engagement. For girls presenting a profile marked by any type of behavior and social problems, a lower sense of competence led to lower emotional engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that sense of relatedness to school is especially important for students at-risk of low engagement because of an accumulation of behavior and social problems.",2020-02-01,Learning and Individual Differences,https://openalex.org/V9267903,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2020.101842,101842,101842,78,,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007147717,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2020.101842,journal-article,3007147717

At the beginning of the new decade, populism in the US is associated with support for the Republican party and Donald Trump in particular, and that is how I address it here. Using secondary data from a number of related studies, we find that, overall, support for Trump is not only negatively related to political knowledge, but also to other factors that make his supporters unaware of their being misinformed. This is because, more than for others, partisan cues serve them as a basis for their factual beliefs about political actors and events and assessments of the beliefs of others. While political knowledge has long been comparatively low in the US, as I show in the early part of the article, the relationship between misinformation and populism (i.e., support for Trump) is seen as a new and especially worrisome element.

By deciphering mechanistic aspects of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-host interactions, one could discover common strategy for inhibiting the replication of related flaviviruses. By elucidating the HCV interactome, we identified the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) as a human hub of the very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis pathway and core interactor. Here we show that HSD17B12 knockdown (KD) impairs HCV replication and reduces virion production. Mechanistically, depletion of HSD17B12 induces alterations in VLCFA-containing lipid species and a drastic reduction of lipid droplets (LDs) that play a critical role in virus assembly. Oleic acid supplementation rescues viral RNA replication and production of infectious particles in HSD17B12 depleted cells, supporting a specific role of VLCFA in HCV life cycle. Furthermore, the small-molecule HSD17B12 inhibitor, INH-12, significantly reduces replication and infectious particle production of HCV as well as dengue virus and Zika virus revealing a conserved requirement across Flaviviridae virus family. Overall, the data provide a strong rationale for the advanced evaluation of HSD17B12 inhibition as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for the treatment of Flaviviridae infections.",2020-03-04,Scientific Reports,https://openalex.org/V196734849,Springer Nature,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03590577,,,,,1,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3010264450,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61051-w,journal-article,3010264450

Our objective was to determine whether any of the MEAs in contact with the biofilms elicit a considerable antibiofilm activity. Our hypothesis was that the antibiofilm activity of the MEAs depended on the materials used for the preparation of their tips. The antibiofilm activity of the samples was determined by measuring the ratio of the killed to alive bacteria incubated with microelectrodes. To our knowledge, the antibiofilm activity of MEAs related to their physicochemical properties has not been reported, yet. The use of different tips made of carbon nanotube (CNT) or platinum (Pt) for the samples allowed in situ monitoring of their antibiofilm activity. The complementary data of FTIR and SEM analysis of the samples before and after incubation with the biofilm revealed the attachment of proteins from biofilm on the sample tips. The confocal microscopy showed that the ratio of dead to alive cells incubated with the MEAs coated with parylene-C, the samples with Pt tips and the ones with CNT tips was 15.2% ± 9.8%, 40.4% ± 12.3% and 25.8% ± 8.2%, respectively. This study presented the evidence of the effect of type of sample tips on the anti-biofilm effect of MEAs.

Our article addresses this gap by examining how sharing leadership is negotiated in team interactions that are steeped in asymmetry deriving from the professional hierarchy. Adopting a leadership-in-interaction approach, we draw on fine-grained analysis of observed interactions on interprofessional teams from two health care organizations to compare the discursive strategies used by professionals in a superior hierarchical position to the ones used by those in inferior positions to share leadership. These strategies are organized into a matrix of interactional moves that resist or enact the professional hierarchy. Empirical vignettes are provided to demonstrate how sharing leadership and hierarchical leadership can be co-present and even intertwined in an interaction. We show that leadership is shared (or not) as a result of how the professional hierarchy gets negotiated in interactions. More specifically, we conclude that the sharing of leadership in this context tends to occur prior to decision making, especially around problem formulation, if the interactional climate allows. Furthermore, it requires concrete effort: Those in superior positions of influence mindfully relax the hierarchy whereas those in inferior positions create moments of sharing leadership through resistance and struggle.",2020-04-11,Leadership,https://openalex.org/V95314075,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1742715020917817,568,591,16,5,0,5,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016037338,https://doi.org/10.1177/1742715020917817,journal-article,3016037338

The purpose of this study is to see if the anatomy of the coracoid affects the location of glenoid rim defects. We hypothesized that a prominent coracoid (lower and lateral) would be more likely to cause an anterior–inferior glenoid lesion, and a less prominent coracoid more prone to cause an anterior lesion. The null hypothesis being the absence of correlation. Fifty-one shoulder CT-scans from a prospective database, with 3D reconstruction, were analyzed. The position of glenoid lesions was identified using the validated clock method, identifying the beginning and end time. The size of bony glenoid defects was calculated using the validated glenoid ratio method. The position of the coracoid tip was measured in three orthogonal planes. Analysis included 2 right shoulders and 2 left shoulders in seven females and 4 males. The vertical position of the coracoid tip relative to the top of the glenoid was highly correlated to the location of the glenoid defect on the profile view (r = −0.625; 95% CI 0.423–0.768; p = 0.001). Thus, higher coracoids were associated with anterior lesions, while lower coracoids were associated with anterior–inferior lesions. A more laterally prominent coracoid was also correlated with anterior–inferior lesions (r = 0.433; 95% CI 0.179–0.633; p = 0.002).

The area being probed by a conventional Raman spectrometer is, however, limited to the size of the laser beam (∼1 µm); hence, detailed mapping of inhomogeneities in a graphene sample requires slow and sequential acquisition of a Raman spectrum at each pixel. Studies of physical and chemical processes on polycrystalline and heterogeneous graphene films require more advanced hyperspectral Raman capable of fast imaging at a high spatial resolution over hundreds of microns. Here, we compare the capacity of two different Raman imaging schemes (scanning and global) to probe graphene films modified by a low-pressure plasma treatment and present an analysis method providing assessments of the surface properties at local defects, grain boundaries, and other heterogeneities. By comparing statistically initial and plasma-treated regions of graphene, we highlight the presence of inhomogeneities after plasma treatment linked to the initial state of the graphene surface. These results provided statistical results on the correlation between the graphene initial state and the corresponding graphene-plasma interaction.

However, research has yet to reach a consensus on the effectiveness of several specific authority exertion strategies. One of these strategies, which theoretically holds the potential to foster both compliance and internalization, is parental use of logical consequences. Using an experimental vignette methodology and a sample of 214 adolescents (Mage = 15.28 years), the current study compared the effects of logical consequences with classical authority exertion strategies (mild punishments, reasoning, and no authority exertion). Results showed that adolescents held favorable perceptions regarding logical consequences; they rated logical consequences as the most acceptable and, on an equal footing with mild punishments, the most effective strategy to elicit future compliance. Furthermore, whereas older adolescents did not generally anticipate that their reasons to comply would vary as a function of parents’ choice of authority exertion strategies, younger adolescents anticipated that they would comply for more well-internalized reasons in response to logical consequences compared with mild punishments. Implications of these findings for the promotion of optimal parenting and future research directions are discussed.",2020-04-01,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,https://openalex.org/V201005279,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2019.104777,104777,104777,192,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999039517,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2019.104777,journal-article,2999039517

Increased urbanization typically results in higher nutrient and carbon (C) inputs to streams from their watersheds and increased flow rates due to modification in channel form, reducing within stream net retention and increasing downstream exports. However, less is known on how moderate urbanization might influence the joint processing of C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in streams or the relative influence of changes in watershed and stream features on their fluxes. In this study, we performed mass-balances of different C, N, and P species in multiple reaches with contrasting land use land cover and geomorphic features (pools, riffles, runs) to determine the effects of geomorphology versus human influence on elemental fluxes in a pristine and a semi-urban stream. N was the most responsive of all elements, where nitrate concentrations were 3.5-fold higher in the peri-urban stream. Dissolved organic carbon was only slightly higher in the peri-urban site whereas total P not significantly different between streams. In terms of fluxes, nitrate behaved differently between the streams with net retention occurring in the majority of the reaches of the pristine site, whereas net export was observed in all of the reaches of the semi-urban one. We found a decrease in nitrate concentrations with an increase in excess deuterium of the water (d-excess), an indicator of how overall water retention capacity of the watershed favored N loss. Within the stream, the presence of pools, and reduced channel slope, which also increase water retention time, again favored N loss. Overall, nitrate was the most sensitive nutrient to slight urbanization, where higher export to stream was influenced by land use, but where geomorphic features were more important in driving retention capacity.",2020-01-11,Science of The Total Environment,https://openalex.org/V86852077,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136411,,,,,0,4,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2999233608,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136411,journal-article,2999233608

This study assessed CS according to T and N stages in patients treated surgically for nmRCC. Patients and Methods: Within the SEER database (2001–2015), all patients with nmRCC treated with either partial or radical nephrectomy were identified. CSM-free estimates according to T and N stage and substage groupings (pT1aN0–pT4N0 and pTanyN1) and multivariable Cox regression models with adjustment for Fuhrman grade and histologic subtype were assessed. Results: According to T and N stage and substage groupings, the following patients were included in the study: 35,966 (46.2%) with pT1aN0 disease; 18,858 (24.2%) with pT1bN0; 5,977 (7.7%) with pT2aN0; 2,511 (3.2%) with pT2bN0; 11,839 (15.2%) with pT3aN0; 1,03 (1.3%) with pT3b–cN0; 40 (0.5%) with pT4N0; and 1,30 (1.7%) with pTanyN1. Conditional CSM-free survival estimates were 98.2% at 1 year versus 98.0% at 1 years of event-free follow-up for patients with pT1aN0 disease, relative to baseline. Conversely, pT4N0/pTanyN1 conditional CSM-free survival estimates were 55.8% at 1 year versus 77.9% at  years of event-free follow-up. Attrition due to mortality was highest in patients with pT4N0/pTanyN1 disease. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, T stage, tumor grade, and histologic subtype represented independent predictors, but no interactions were identified. Conclusions: Tumor stage and its substages represent extremely important determinants of prognosis after lengthy event-free follow-up.

We recorded from 414 cells distributed throughout these two nuclei (referred to together as the pallidum) while cats walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle that advanced towards them. Neuronal activity in many cells in both structures was modulated on a step-by-step basis during unobstructed locomotion and was modified in the step over the obstacle. On a population basis, the most frequently observed change, in both the EP and the GPe, was an increase in activity prior to and/or during the swing phase of the step over the obstacle by the contralateral forelimb, when it was the first limb to pass over the obstacle. Our results support a contribution of the pallidum, in concert with cortical structures, to the control of both the planning and the execution of the gait modifications.

The discrimination of these two types of fatigue is necessary to better adapt recovery intervention. The Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements describes the neuromotor impulse response using lognormal functions and has many applications in pathology detection. The ideal motor control is modeled and a change in the neuromuscular system is reflected in parameters extracted according to this theory.The objective of this study was to assess whether a shoulder neuromuscular fatigue could be detected through parameters describing the theory, if there is the possibility to discriminate central from peripheral fatigue, and which handwriting test gives the most relevant information on fatigue.Twenty healthy participants performed two sessions of fast stroke handwriting on a tablet, before and after a shoulder fatigue. The fatigue was in internal rotation for one session and in external rotation during the other session. The drawings consisted of simple strokes, triangles, horizontal, and vertical oscillations. Parameters of these strokes were extracted according to the Sigma-Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory. The evolution of each participant was analyzed through a U-Mann-Whitney test for individual comparisons. A Hotelling's T2-test and a U-Mann-Whitney test were also performed on all participants to assess the group evolution after fatigue. Moreover, a correlation among parameters was calculated through Spearman coefficients to assess intrinsic parameters properties of each handwriting test.Central and peripheral parameters were statistically different before and after fatigue with a possibility to discriminate them. Participants had various responses to fatigue. However, when considering the group, parameters related to the motor program execution showed significant increase in the handwriting tests after shoulder fatigue. The test of simple strokes permits to know more specifically where the fatigue comes from, whereas the oscillations tests were the most sensitive to fatigue.The results of this study suggest that the Sigma-Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory is an innovative approach for fatigue detection with discrimination between the central and peripheral systems.

This study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics and evaluate the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine (Simbadol, 1. mg/mL) administered by different routes in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twenty-four dogs were included in a randomized, prospective, masked, clinical trial. Buprenorphine (0.0 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) ( n = 8/group) 0. h before general anesthesia with propofol-isoflurane. Carprofen (4.4 mg/kg SC) was administered after anesthetic induction and before ovariohysterectomy. Pain was scored using the short-form Glasgow composite pain scale for dogs (SF-GCPS). Dogs were administered morphine (0.2 mg/kg IV) when SF-GCPS scores were ≥ 5/20. Blood sampling was performed up to 72 min after drug administration. Plasma buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine concentrations were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine was described using a non-compartmental model (PK Solver 2.0). Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models and Fisher’s exact test ( p &lt; 0.05). Results Pain scores were significantly higher than baseline after IV (0.5– h), IM (0.5– h) and SC (0.5– h) but not among groups. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly higher in SC (7/8 dogs) than IV (2/8) but not different between IV and IM (3/8) or IM and SC. The frequency of rescue analgesia was not significantly different among groups (IV = 2, IM =  and SC = 9). Norbuprenorphine was not detected. For IV, IM and SC administration, clearance was 1.29, 1.6 and 1.4 L/hour/kg, volume of distribution was 6.8, 14.2 and 40.1 L/kg, the elimination half-life was 3.7, 5.7, 2 h, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curved extrapolated to infinity was 15.7, 12.4 and 16.4 ng/mL/hour, respectively. Bioavailability for IM and SC was 62.6 and 40%, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of buprenorphine were 6.2 and 1. ng/mL at 0.1 and 0.3 h after IM and SC administration, respectively. Conclusions The route of administration influences the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine in dogs. SC administration of buprenorphine failed to provide clinical analgesia due to erratic drug absorption.

Recent advances in the study of the human visual system suggest that ACh is a likely component underlying interocular interactions. However, our understanding of its precise role in binocular processes is currently lacking. Here we use binocular rivalry as a probe of interocular dynamics to determine ACh9s effects, via the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) donepezil, on the binocular visual system. A total of 23 subjects (1 male) completed two crossover experimental sessions where binocular rivalry measurements were obtained before and after taking either donepezil ( mg) or a placebo (lactose) pill. We report that enhanced cholinergic potentiation attenuates perceptual suppression during binocular rivalry, reducing the overall rate of interocular competition while enhancing the visibility of superimposition mixed percepts. Considering recent evidence that perceptual suppression during binocular rivalry is causally modulated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, our results suggest that cholinergic activity counteracts the effect of GABA with regards to interocular dynamics and may modulate the inhibitory drive within the visual cortex. <b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our research demonstrates that the cholinergic system is implicated in modulating binocular interactions in the human visual cortex.

The successful rollout of PMTCT in sub-Saharan Africa has decreased Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), reduced child mortality and improved maternal health. In South Africa, PMTCT is now integrated into existing primary health care (PHC) services and this experience could serve as a relevant example for integrating other programmes into comprehensive primary care. This study explored the perspectives of both experts or key informants and frontline health workers (FHCWs) in South Africa on PMTCT integration into PHC in the context of post-AIDS denialism using a Complex Adaptive Systems framework. Methods A total of 2 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted; 10 with experts including national and international health systems and HIV/PMTCT policy makers and researchers, and 10 FHCWs including clinic managers, nurses and midwives. All interviews were conducted in person, audio-recorded and transcribed. Three investigators collaborated in coding transcripts and used an iterative approach for thematic analysis. Results Experts and FHCWs agreed on the importance of integrated PMTCT services. Experts reported a slow and partial integration of PMTCT programmes into PHC following its initial rollout as a stand-alone programme in the aftermath of the AIDS denialism period. Experts and FHCWs diverged on the challenges associated with integration of PMTCT. Experts highlighted bureaucracy, HIV stigma and discrimination and a shortage of training for staff as major barriers to PMTCT integration. In comparison, FHCWs emphasized high workloads, staff turnover and infrastructural issues (e.g., lack of rooms, small spaces) as their main challenges to integration. Both experts and FHCWs suggested that working with community health workers, particularly in the post-partum period, helped to address cases of loss to follow-up of women and their babies and to improve linkages to polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing and immunisation. Conclusions Despite organised efforts in South Africa, experts and FHCWs reported multiple barriers for the full integration of PMTCT in PHC, especially postpartum.

As they are also the most potent drugs for the treatment of equine asthma, we hypothesised that the intra-articular corticosteroids used to treat joint diseases also improve the lung function in horses with severe asthma, thus potentially delaying the diagnosis of this common lung condition. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of intra-articular (IA) and intramuscular (IM) triamcinolone acetonide (TA) on lung function in horses with severe asthma. STUDY DESIGN Randomised and controlled experiment on asthma-prone research animals. METHODS Horses with severe asthma in clinical exacerbation were given either 20 mg of TA in both tarsocrural joints (n = 5; 40 mg/horse) or 40 mg of TA intramuscularly (n = 5). Lung function and TA serum concentrations were measured weekly for 35 days. TA serum concentrations were also evaluated on day 3. RESULTS The pulmonary resistance (RL ) and elastance (EL ) values decreased by day  in the IA group (P<0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively) and by day 1 in the IM group (P = 0.002 and 0.03, respectively).

Our objectives were to document the periods during which gray birch established in temperate peatlands of southern Quebec (Canada), and examine the factors that may have contributed to such massive establishment. We hypothesized that the abundant presence of gray birch is a relatively recent phenomenon associated with human activities that are creating conditions favorable to the establishment of this species. We analyzed dendrochronological, plant-macrofossil, aerial photographs and climatic data for 10 sites. All of the peatlands recently experienced a major increase in forest cover. The first sign of gray birch establishment dates back to the 1950s, although at over half of sites, establishment took place after 1980. Abundant macroremains of the species were found only in the upper portion of peat deposits. Birch encroachment most often occurred after a fire had spread through the peatland. Increasing agricultural and draining activities on the periphery of the peatlands, that coincides with drier climatic conditions, likely induced a drying out of the peat, thereby creating conditions propitious for fire and subsequent germination and growth of birch seeds.",2020-04-01,Wetlands,https://openalex.org/V127668553,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-019-01186-3,351,364,40,2,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2954678060,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-019-01186-3,journal-article,2954678060

Few case series and registry reports have assessed the question, and even fewer studies have included a control group. The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall outcome of patients undergoing CEA after IVT and to compare them with contemporary patients with CEA after simple stroke (non-IVT group). It also aimed to evaluate the differences in outcomes of stroke patients requiring CEA between nonvascular and vascular centers. <h3>Methods</h3> The data of 16 consecutive patients who have undergone CEA after stroke in a single center was analyzed from January 201 to December 2016, 27 of them (16%) having undergone previous IVT. A comparative analysis between the non-IVT and the IVT groups was performed. The time between stroke diagnosis and referral to a vascular specialist was also studied. <h3>Results</h3> Age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities were similar in both groups. Median time between stroke and CEA was 1 days (Q1-Q3, 8-23 days), with 1 of the 27 patients (59%) in the IVT group undergoing CEA less than 1 days after the initial event. There were three intracranial hemorrhages (2.1%) in the non-IVT group versus one (3.7%) in the IVT group (<i>P</i> = NS). The overall 30-day combined stroke and death rate was 7.1% (6.3% in the non-IVT group vs 11.1% in the IVT group; <i>P</i> = .70). The incidence of postoperative cervical hematoma requiring reoperation was similar in both groups (2.1% vs 3.7%; <i>P</i> = NS). The median time between diagnosis of stroke and referral to a vascular specialist was higher for patients in nonvascular centers compared with vascular centers (3.5 days vs 1.0 day; <i>P</i> < .001), which translated to fewer patients referred from nonvascular centers undergoing surgery in the 14-day window period (38% vs 67%; <i>P</i> < .001). <h3>Conclusions</h3> In this retrospective analysis, CEA after IVT showed similar outcomes when compared with the overall CEA after stroke population. Stroke patients diagnosed in nonvascular centers were referred later than those in vascular centers and, although postoperative outcomes were similar, that was correlated with fewer patients undergoing surgery in a timely fashion.",2020-04-01,Journal of Vascular Surgery,https://openalex.org/V104135014,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2019.05.061,1254,1259,71,4,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972730644,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2019.05.061,journal-article,2972730644

In this study, we investigated the effects of two interpersonal rule-reminding climates (autonomy-supportive vs. controlling) and two constraint strategies (logical consequences vs. mild punishments) on two emotional precursors of internalization (empathy and anger). We also extended findings from a past study by looking at the association between these two emotions and children’s acceptability beliefs regarding authority strategies. 221 children (Mage = 10.42) read hypothetical rule-breaking scenarios, indicated their anticipated reactions in terms of anger and empathy, and rated the acceptability of the exerted authority strategies. Autonomy-supportive climates and logical consequences elicited less anger and more empathy than respectively controlling climates and mild punishments. This emotional pattern was in turn associated with greater acceptability beliefs. Finally, significant indirect links from interpersonal climates and constraint strategies to acceptability beliefs, via anticipated emotions, were observed. These results highlight the potential relevance of using logical consequences in an autonomy-supportive climate, as this combination of strategies seems more effective in promoting emotional precursors of children’s internalization process.",2020-06-01,Journal of Child and Family Studies,https://openalex.org/V87914957,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-019-01594-3,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2975671642,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-019-01594-3,journal-article,2975671642

If this phenomenon is well established, discussions about the “partisan gap” often treat partisan groups as if they were two homogeneous blocks. In this article, we question this practice. According to theory, strong partisan identification (PID) puts pressure on partisans to hold beliefs that conform to elite discourse and to perceived in-group positions. Meanwhile, public opinion research on environmental issues offers reasons to expect greater heterogeneity among Republicans than among Democrats. This literature leads us to predict that strong Republicans will be more skeptical about GCC than Republican leaners, whereas among Democrats, PID strength will not be associated with greater confidence in the existence of GCC. Our study tests this hypothesis leveraging the characteristics of a unique dataset where strong partisans are purposively oversampled to facilitate group comparisons. Results from multivariate regression models support our prediction. Next, our study also examines how PID strength shapes more complex patterns found in the literature. Previous work has shown that, compared to Democrats, the views of Republicans are less correlated with educational attainment and more influenced by issue labeling (e.g., global warming vs climate change). Our study tests if PID strength also moderates these factors. This time, interaction models produce mixed results. Overall, our findings suggest that breaking down GCC beliefs by PID strength can reveal a more nuanced understanding of the differences between and within partisan groups.",2020-03-01,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,https://openalex.org/V2764462298,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-019-00576-7,,,,,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2986396463,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-019-00576-7,journal-article,2986396463

METHODS Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched with no language or date restrictions to identify cohort studies of consecutive participants undergoing resective surgery that reported seizure outcomes. The authors recorded all preoperative factors that could plausibly be associated with seizure outcomes and used Cox regression analysis to identify which of these variables were associated with seizure freedom (i.e., Engel class I). RESULTS Of 72 citations, 1 articles reporting on 18 participants were eligible. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was observed in 11 participants (60.4%). On univariate analyses, younger age at disease onset (hazard ratio [HR] 0.906, p = 0.001), younger age at surgery (HR 0.928, p &lt; 0.001), shorter time to surgery (HR 0.921, p = 0.001), and hemispherectomy (HR 0.283, p &lt; 0.001) were all associated with longer time to postoperative seizure recurrence. Additionally, multivariable analysis including the aforementioned variables showed that younger age at surgery (HR 0.946, p = 0.043) and hemispherectomy (HR 0.297, p &lt; 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with a greater time to seizure recurrence and longer duration of seizure freedom. CONCLUSIONS The majority of pediatric patients undergoing resective or hemispheric surgery for RE achieve good seizure outcome. Although small retrospective cohort studies are inherently prone to bias, the best available evidence utilizing individual participant data suggests hemispheric surgery and younger age at surgery are associated with good seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery.

Aerobic fitness has a protective effect on cognition in older adults, but no study has investigated this effect in obese individuals. The present study aimed to 1) compare cognitive function in lower-fit (LoFit) and higher-fit (HiFit) obese individuals compared with nonobese individuals, and 2) examine the association between exercise variables (including hemodynamic variables) and cognitive function in obese individuals. Methods Fifty-four obese and 1 nonobese individuals performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (with gas exchange analysis and noninvasive hemodynamic measurement) and cognitive tests assessing short-term and working memory, processing speed, executive function, and long-term verbal memory. Obese individuals were divided into  groups according to their median aerobic fitness divided by lean body mass to form a group of LoFit obese (n = 27) and a group of HiFit obese (n = 27) individuals. Results A total of 1 nonobese individuals and 4 obese individuals were included in the final analysis (HiFit: n = 26, LoFit: n = 23). Compared with LoFit obese, HiFit obese participants had greater performances in executive function (P = 0.002) and short-term memory (P = 0.02).

Precise mapping of subsurface properties, especially soil parent material (SPM), is critical to understanding most geomorphic and hydrologic processes. Because spatial variability of the subsurface properties is highly correlated to the morphology of the earth’s surface, DEMs and aerial/satellite imagery have been used successfully for lithological mapping. However, most of the studies using this approach have used either coarse-resolution DEMs or covered limited areas. LiDAR-derived topographic attributes may provide an opportunity for finer-resolution mapping of subsurface properties at much larger spatial scales. Here, we present an approach that uses object-based image analysis (OBIA) – the process of clustering pixels into homogeneous objects – paired with a classification tree (CT) algorithm to map SPM at  m resolution and at a regional spatial scale using LiDAR-derived topographic attributes. Combining OBIA of topographic attributes with the CT method proved to be an efficient approach for mapping of SPM at fine resolution and broad scales. Using field-acquired SPM samples, we found that this approach was able to explain 73.5% of the variance of three SPM classes (i.e., bedrock, glacial till, sands) using only four common topographic metrics (i.e., slope, topographic wetness index, terrain ruggedness index, multi-resolution topographic positioning index).

Interneurons located in stratum oriens/alveus (O/A INs) receive excitatory inputs from CA1 pyramidal cells and express a Hebbian form of long-term potentiation (LTP) at their excitatory input synapses. This LTP requires the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 1a (mGluR1a) and Ca 2+ entry via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. However, the type of TRP channels involved in synaptic transmission at these synapses remains largely unknown. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that slow excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked in O/A INs are dependent on TRP channels but may be independent of phospholipase C. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we found that mRNA for TRPC 1, 3–7 was present in CA1 hippocampus. Using single-cell RT-PCR, we found expression of mRNA for TRPC 1, 4–7, but not TRPC3, in O/A INs. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cell expression system, we found that TRPC1 and TRPC4 interacted with mGluR1a. Co-immunoprecipitation in hippocampus showed that TRPC1 interacted with mGluR1a. Using immunofluorescence, we found that TRPC1 co-localized with mGluR1a in O/A IN dendrites, whereas TRPC localization appeared limited to O/A IN cell body. Down-regulation of TRPC1, but not TRPC4, expression in O/A INs using small interfering RNAs prevented slow EPSCs, suggesting that TRPC1 is an obligatory TRPC subunit for these EPSCs. Our findings uncover a functional role of TRPC1 in mGluR1a-mediated slow excitatory synaptic transmission onto O/A INs that could be involved in Hebbian LTP at these synapses.",2020-01-29,Molecular Brain,https://openalex.org/V182046277,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-0558-9,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007311030,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-020-0558-9,journal-article,3007311030

An internet survey was administered to Canadian dairy producers between March and April 201 to collect information on current management practices. Approximately 81% (867/1,076) and 63% (673/1,065) of respondents reported that at least one animal died unassisted and at least one animal was euthanized on the farm in the preceding 12-mo period, respectively. Overall, mean mortality was 8% for cows, and  and 2% for preweaning and weaned heifers, respectively. On average, 48, 76, and 89% of all reported mortality events in cows, weaned heifers, and preweaning heifers were recorded as unassisted deaths. Cows that died without assistance were necropsied more often than preweaning heifers dying without assistance; these cows were also necropsied more than cows that were euthanized. Conversely, preweaning heifers that were euthanized were necropsied more frequently than those that died without assistance. Choosing not to perform necropsies on animals that die of unknown causes could represent a missed opportunity to identify cause of death and inform changes to prevent future deaths. The use of a firearm was the most common method for euthanizing cows and heifers (54%) and male dairy calves (51%). Approximately 7% of respondents reported using blunt force to euthanize animals. The use of this method was much higher for euthanasia of male dairy calves (34%) than for heifer calves (7%). Quebec respondents euthanized their animals using blunt force more often than farmers from other regions. Further, 53% of respondents using blunt force indicated it was their primary method of calf euthanasia; these results are extremely concerning.

The aim of this exploratory study was to identify pain-induced behaviors in cats before and after treatment of oral disease using video assessment. Twenty-four cats ( ± 3. years old; 4.9 ± 1. kg) were included in a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Cats were equally divided into minimal (G1: minimal dental treatment) or severe (G2: multiple dental extractions) oral disease groups. After acclimation at day 0, they underwent oral examination, radiographs, scaling, and dental extractions under general anesthesia (anesthetic protocol: acepromazine, hydromorphone, propofol, isoflurane, meloxicam, and local anesthetic blocks; day 1), and were discharged at day 6. Cats were filmed remotely for 1 min using a wide-angle glass lens camera before surgery (baseline) and throughout the study at different time points (3 h of video recording).

Duration of “pawing the ribbon” (playing) was significantly shorter in G2 than G1 at day 1 Feeding and post-feeding behaviors with soft food were not significantly different between groups or over time. Frequency of “difficulty grasping dry food” was significantly higher in G2 than G1 up to day 6. Frequency of post-feeding “head shaking” was significantly higher in both groups at day  when compared with baseline. Conclusions This study identified pain-induced behaviors in cats undergoing treatment of oral disease. These behaviors may be used to differentiate painful versus pain-free cats in clinical practice.",2020-04-10,BMC Veterinary Research,https://openalex.org/V197820984,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02302-w,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016002050,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02302-w,journal-article,3016002050

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the factors associated with health promotion practice (HPP) among mental health professionals.Methods: Cross-sectional survey including mental health professionals across the Province of Quebec (Canada). The promotion of health behaviour and the Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire - Health Practitioner Version and its adaptation for nutrition improvement and tobacco cessation were used to evaluate knowledge, beliefs, promotion behaviours, and barriers to HPP.Results: One hundred mental health professionals, most being nurses (29%) and medical doctors/psychiatrists (20%) were recruited throughout the province of Quebec (Canada). The rate of formal training among professionals was 11% for physical activity, 26% for nutrition, and 21% for tobacco cessation. Approximately 60% were promoting physical activity, 49% good nutrition, and 41% tobacco cessation. Professionals promoting healthy behaviours had a higher level of self-efficacy in HPP, were more likely to value physical health, and less likely to endorse barriers to HPP.Conclusion: Rates of formal training in lifestyle habits and health promotion (aiming at improving a healthy lifestyle in patients experiencing psychotic disorders) among mental health professionals are currently low in the Province of Quebec and need to be improved. In addition, the level of confidence and barriers that endorse healthy behaviours appear to be key factors in HPP among mental health professionals.",2020-04-14,Issues in Mental Health Nursing,https://openalex.org/V111094224,Taylor & Francis,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2019.1688436,531,539,41,6,0,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016262572,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2019.1688436,journal-article,3016262572

A high incidence of chronic opioid use (up to 58%) has been documented in these populations with significant negative individual and societal impacts. Despite the importance of this public health issue, optimal strategies to limit the chronic use of opioids after trauma and acute care surgery are not clear. We aim to identify existing strategies to prevent chronic opioid use in these populations. Methods and analysis We will perform a scoping review of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature to identify studies, reviews, recommendations and guidelines on strategies aimed at preventing chronic opioid use in patients after trauma and acute care surgery. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINHAL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ProQuest and websites of trauma and acute care surgery, pain, government and professional organisations. Databases will be searched for papers published from  January 200 to a maximum of  months before submission of the final manuscript. Two reviewers will independently evaluate studies for eligibility and extract data from included studies using a standardised data abstraction form. Preventive strategies will be classified according to their types and targeted trauma populations and acute care surgery procedures. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval is not required as this study is based on the secondary use of published data. This work will inform research and clinical stakeholders on the required next steps towards the uptake of effective strategies aimed at preventing chronic opioid use in trauma and acute care surgery patients.",2020-04-14,BMJ Open,https://openalex.org/V79054089,BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035268,,,,,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3016842131,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035268,journal-article,3016842131

In higher vertebrates, the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor gives rise to α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which are involved in numerous physiological aspects. Genetic defects in POMC are linked to metabolic disorders in humans and animals. In the present study, we undertook an evolutionary genetic approach complemented with biochemistry to investigate the functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in the POMC system of free-living outbred barn owl species (family Tytonidae) at the molecular level. Our phylogenetic studies revealed a striking correlation between a loss-of-function H9P mutation in the β-MSH receptor-binding motif and an extension of a poly-serine stretch in γ3-MSH to ≥7 residues that arose in the barn owl group 6-8 MYA ago. We found that extension of the poly-serine stretches in the γ-MSH locus affects POMC precursor processing, increasing γ3-MSH production at the expense of γ2-MSH and resulting in an overall reduction of γ-MSH signaling, which may be part of a negative feedback mechanism. Extension of the γ3-MSH poly-serine stretches ≥7 further markedly increases peptide hormone stability in plasma, which is conserved in humans, and is likely relevant to its endocrine function. In sum, our phylogenetic analysis of POMC in wild living owls uncovered a H9P β-MSH mutation subsequent to serine extension in γ3-MSH to 7 residues, which was then followed by further serine extension. The linked MSH mutations highlight the genetic plasticity enabled by the modular design of the POMC gene.",2020-05-05,PLOS ONE,https://openalex.org/V202381698,Public Library of Science,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231163,e0231163,e0231163,15,5,1,3,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021114393,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231163,journal-article,3021114393

This may be especially true for Inuit youth who, because they are away from their communities, cannot develop networks and relationships that would provide a secure place for their development as an adult and as a community member. The objectives of this study were to document how transition out of care is addressed in a residence specialized for Inuit youth under government care, and to explore, from the perspective of residential managers and staff, what factors facilitate or create obstacles to successful transition. Interviews were conducted to discuss the transition of 11 youth from residential placement back into communities. The criteria used by managers and staff to describe transitions mostly focused on the behaviours of the youth and the ability to create and implement a plan. Are current theme was the importance of continuity and connections with family, staff, and culture. Various measures were put into place around the current system of care in order to facilitate continuity and connections to respond to the cultural and personal needs of youth. To enhance the “cultural competence” of care, we suggest that: (i) criteria for successful and unsuccessful transitions be determined with youth, families, and communities; (ii) that Inuit representation in care be increased; and (iii) that measures be taken outside the current system of care to encourage shifts in power distribution.",2020-05-01,First Peoples Child & Family Review,https://openalex.org/V2764731138,Consortium Erudit,https://doi.org/10.7202/1068865ar,52,75,7,1,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2139989705,https://doi.org/10.7202/1068865ar,journal-article,2139989705

A baseline study was conducted in intervention and control schools and repeated in 2014 to assess the impact. This paper reports on anthropometric and biochemical data in the final and baseline surveys. Both studies were conducted in the fifth grade classes of the same primary schools in Ouagadougou. Six intervention schools had been selected and matched at baseline with six control schools. The total sample consisted of 69 and 65 pupils in 200 and 2014, respectively. Anthropometric and hemoglobin measurements were performed on all children, whereas serum retinol was measured in a random subsample to assess Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD). Independent t-tests and chi-squared tests were used for comparison of means and proportions, respectively, and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to examine associations between nutritional parameters and school characteristics. Final rates of anaemia and VAD were 32.6% and 26.1%, respectively, down from 40.4% and 38.7% at baseline. The final prevalence rate of stunting was 8.1%, thinness was 8.7% and overweight/obesity was 4.4%. Thinness declined significantly in 2014 compared to 2009, but there was no change in the rate of stunting even though the rate of overweight/obesity showed an upward trend. When comparing intervention with control schoolchildren, the only significant differences found in the final survey were less thinness and less anaemia in the intervention children. However, the prevalence of anaemia was also significantly lower in the intervention group at baseline. Our results point to a significant improvement in the nutritional status of schoolchildren in Ouagadougou and suggest a positive, although modest, role for the Nutrition-Friendly School Initiative in reducing thinness, but not overweight.",2020-06-01,Global Health Promotion,https://openalex.org/V93520703,SAGE,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975918789350,26,34,27,2,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2908550543,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975918789350,journal-article,2908550543

The RCFT and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) were administered to 13 participants (90 uncomplicated mTBI patients, 1 complicated mTBI patients, and 2 controls). The mTBI patients demonstrated significantly lower scores than control participants on both immediate and delayed RCFT recall conditions, with performance in the low average and borderline range. However, there was no difference in performance between the two mTBI groups on the recall conditions. In addition, no significant differences were observed across the three groups on the recognition condition. The WASI-II Performance and Verbal IQ scales explained most of the variance in the immediate and delayed RCFT recall conditions but were not associated with performance on the recognition condition.

We propose the term Pharmacologically pertinent period of effect (PPPE) to address this time window. We explored the PPPE in light of the rofecoxib saga. Methods We identified the observational database studies of rofecoxib at doses 25 and 50 mg daily and thromboembolic events. We also obtained the Kaplan-Meier curves of Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research trial (VIGOR) and Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx (APPROVE) trials. Results We found seven observational studies with nine analyses. All the studies only looked at current exposure. At the dose of 25 mg, only three of nine analyses were barely statistically significant. At the dose of 50 mg, the risk ratios were much higher. The visual inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curves shows that in the APPROVE trial (2 mg), the placebo and rofecoxib curves start separating to become statistically significantly different only after 3 months. In contrast the VIGOR (5 mg), curves start separating very early and the divergence increases after  months. Discussion The 50 mg observational studies, looking at current exposure, correctively identified the almost immediate increase in risk evident in the VIGOR Kaplan-Meier curves. The absence of an immediate increase in risk shown by the APPROVE trial was also correctively identified by most observational 25 mg studies. To our knowledge no observational study was done on the long-term cardiac toxicity of the 25-mg dose. It would thus appear that the two doses of rofecoxib have different PPPEs.",2020-01-01,Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,https://openalex.org/V140231191,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4714,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2911052499,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4714,journal-article,2911052499

Here we extend the application of the rologit model to continuous outcomes with ties and ordinal outcomes treated as imperfectly-observed continuous outcomes. By identifying the functional relationship between survival times and continuous outcomes, we explicitly establish the equivalence between the rologit and Cox models to justify the use of the Breslow, Efron and perturbation methods in the analysis of continuous outcomes with ties. Using simulation, we found all three methods perform well with few ties.

Recent studies suggest that attachment and depressive symptoms may act as a filter in the perception of partner responsiveness, and a barrier to the capacity of being responsive to a partner. Given studies suggesting higher depressive symptoms and relationship insecurities in women experiencing genito-pelvic pain compared to controls, investigating the role of these factors in partner responsiveness may help couples improve their wellbeing in the challenging context of PVD. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between depressive symptoms, attachment, and perceived and observed partner responsiveness in 50 couples coping with PVD. Participants took part in a videotaped discussion and completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, attachment, and perceived partner responsiveness. Based on the actor-partner interdependence model, results indicated that when women and partners reported greater depressive symptoms and anxious attachment, they perceived each other as being less responsive.

DSRC/802.11p MAC layer has strict reliability requirement for ITS safety applications. In city environment, transmission in wireless medium is vulnerable to packet collisions and interferences. Cross channel interference is quite predominant in the presence of high rise buildings and concurrent transmissions. Achieving high reliability (e.g., 0.99) in the presence of all kinds of communication vulnerabilities is a major challenge in urban environments. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing emergency message dissemination schemes, in the literature, achieves high reliability in lossy channel. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that achieves high reliability for message dissemination while satisfying delay requirements, for various channel conditions. This paper proposes a new broadcast scheme, called Bayesian networks and unipolar orthogonal Code based Reliable multi-hop Broadcast (BCRB) to address this issue. Our objective is to guarantee strict reliability requirement (e.g., 99%) in each hop using broadcast repetitions. We propose an approach, based on using Bayesian networks, that exploits periodic beacons to accurately infer 802.11p link reception quality at each hop. Using this information, a sender determines an optimal number of repetitions, multiple forwarders and their positions. To combat interference, during broadcast repetitions, BCRB uses Uni-Polar Orthogonal Codes (UPOC). For multi-hop transmissions, multiple forwarders cooperatively communicate at each hop with the objective to achieve high broadcast reliability in next hop. Simulation results show that BCRB achieves very high reliability. Furthermore, BCRB satisfies delay requirements for time-sensitive vehicular applications with relatively low overhead. BCRB achieves 35-40% improvement in comparison to existing schemes.",2020-01-01,Vehicular Communications,https://openalex.org/V2480748589,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vehcom.2019.100181,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2972367452,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vehcom.2019.100181,journal-article,2972367452

The universal claim of this model has rarely been tested across groups of students with diverse immigration backgrounds, socioeconomic status, or emotional problems such as anxiety. To fill this gap, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine the associations between, on the one hand, student self-perceptions of competence in mathematics, of autonomy and of relatedness, and on the other hand, their behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement. We further tested whether immigration status and anxiety moderated these associations. The study involved 170 elementary school students from disadvantaged multiethnic schools. Results demonstrated that high relatedness was associated with affective engagement in all students. Furthermore, the links between students’ engagement and their self-perceptions of autonomy and competence in mathematics varied according to their immigration status and anxiety level.

However, dealing with sporadic resources such as the intermittent production of seed masting trees may be challenging unless reliable cues also make them predictable. To be adaptive, the anticipation of such episodic events would have to trigger the corresponding physiological response. Epigenetic modifications could result in such physiological anticipatory responses to future changes. The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) is known to adjust its reproductive activity to match juvenile weaning with peak seed availability of masting trees, which are essential for their survival. We therefore expected that epigenetic changes would be linked to spring reproductive initiation in anticipation for beech seed availability in fall. We correlated the variation of DNA methylation profiles of 11 adult chipmunks captured in May with beech seeds abundance in September, over  years, for three distinct populations, as well as individuals sampled twice during reproductive and non-reproductive years. The significant correlation between spring epigenetic variation and the amount of food in the fall confirmed the phenotypic flexibility of individuals according to environmental fluctuations. Altogether, these results underlined the key role of epigenetic processes in anticipatory responses enabling organisms to persist in fluctuating environments.",2020-01-01,Current Zoology,https://openalex.org/V58136343,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/eep/dvz026,,,6,1,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3003655447,https://doi.org/10.1093/eep/dvz026,journal-article,3003655447

This study assesses glucose, total InsulinT, Insulin2 and insulin receptor subunits α and β in testis during mouse development then, in the spontaneously type 2 diabetes models associated with infertility db/db and ob/ob mice. IR-β and α were also assessed in spermatozoa (SPZ), anterior pituitary (AP) and serum. Methods Serum and tissue glucose were measured with enzymatic colorimetric assays and InsulinT and Insulin2 by ELISAs in serum, interstitial tissue- (ITf) and seminiferous tubule (STf) fractions in14- &gt; 60-day-old normal and db/db , ob/ob and wild type (WT) mice. IR subunits were assessed by immunoblotting in tissues and by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting in serum. Results Development : Glucose increased in serum, ITf and STf. InsulinT and Insulin2 dropped in serum; both were higher in STf than in ITf. In &gt; 60-day-old mouse ITf, insulinT rose whereas Insulin2 decreased; InsulinT and Insulin2 rose concurrently in STf. Glucose and insulin were high in &gt; 60-day-old ITf; in STf high insulin accompanied low glucose. One hundred ten kDa IR-β peaked in 28-day-old ITf and 14-day-old STf. One hundred thirty five kDa IR-α was high in ITf but decreased in STf. Glucose escalated in db/db and ob/ob sera. Glucose doubled in ITf while being halved in STf in db/db mice. Glucose significantly dropped in db/db and ob/ob mice spermatozoa. InsulinT and Insulin2 rose significantly in the serum, ITf and STf in db/db and ob/ob mice. One hundred ten kDa IR-β and 135 kDa IR-α decreased in db/db and ob/ob ITf. Only 110 kDa IR-β dropped in db/db and ob/ob STf and AP. One hundred ten kDa IR-β fell in db/db and ob/ob SPZ. One hundred ten kDa s IR-α rose in the db/db and ob/ob mouse sera. Conclusion Insuli regulates glucose in tubules not in the interstitium. The mouse interstitium contains InsulinT and Insulin2 whereas tubules contain Insulin2. Decreased 110 kDa IR-β and 135 kDa IR-α in the db/db and ob/ob interstitial tissue suggest a loss of active receptor sites that could alter the testicular cell insulin binding and response to the hormone.

This study aimed to quantify and characterize DPM exposures in three workplaces with different exposure levels: an underground mine, a subway tunnel, and a truck repair workshop. The same sampling strategy was used and included measurements of the particle number concentration (PNC), mass concentration, size distribution, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the characterization of carbonaceous fractions. The highest geometric means (GMs) of PNC and elemental carbon (EC) were measured in the mine [13 00 (geometric standard deviation, GSD = 1.5) particles cm−3 and 12 (GSD = 2.1) µg m−3], followed by the tunnel [3 80 (GSD = 1.7) particles cm−3 and 24.7 (GSD = 2.4) µg m−3], and the truck workshop [2 70 (GSD = 1.3) particles cm−3 and 2. (GSD = 2.4) µg m−3]. This gradient of exposure was also observed for total carbon (TC) and particulate matter. The TC/EC ratio was 1.4 in the mine, 2. in the tunnel and 8.7 in the workshop, indicating important organic carbon interference in the non-mining workplaces. EC and PNC were strongly correlated in the tunnel (r = 0.85; P &amp;lt; 0.01) and the workshop (r = 0.91; P &amp;lt; 0.001), but a moderate correlation was observed in the mine (r = 0.57; P &amp;lt; 0.05). Results from TEM showed individual carbon spheres between 1 and 56.5 nm organized in agglomerates, while results from the size distribution profiles showed bimodal distributions with a larger accumulation mode in the mine (9 nm) compared with the tunnel (3 nm) and the truck workshop (3 nm). In conclusion, the composition of the carbonaceous fraction varies according to the workplace, and can interfere with DPM estimation when TC is used as indicator. Also, the dominance of particles &amp;lt;10 nm in all workplaces, the high levels of PNC measured and the good correlation with EC suggest that UFP exposures should receive more attention on occupational routine measurements and regulations.",2020-06-24,Annals of Work Exposures and Health,https://openalex.org/V2734824697,Oxford University Press,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa027,,,,,0,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3014344204,https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa027,journal-article,3014344204

Azapeptide analogs of growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) have been developed as selective CD36 ligands and evaluated for their anti-atherosclerotic properties in apoe−/− mice. Methods From  to 1 weeks of age, male apoe−/− mice were fed a high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet, then switched to normal chow and treated daily with 300 nmol/kg of MPE-001 ([aza-Tyr4]-GHRP-6) or MPE-003 ([aza-(N,N-diallylaminobut-2-ynyl)Gly4]-GHRP-6) for  weeks. In another protocol, mice were fed a HFHC diet throughout the study. Results Azapeptides decreased lesion progression in the aortic arch and reduced aortic sinus lesion areas below pre-existing lesions levels in apoe−/− mice which were switched to chow diet. In mice fed a HFHC throughout the study, azapeptides reduced lesion progression in the aortic vessel and sinus. The anti-atherosclerotic effect of azapeptides was associated with a reduced ratio of iNOS+/CD206+ macrophages within lesions, and lowered plasma inflammatory cytokine levels. Monocytes from azapeptide-treated mice showed altered mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, consistent with an M2-like phenotype. These effects were dependent on CD36, and not observed in apoe−/−cd36−/− mice. Conclusions Azapeptides MPE-001 and MPE-003 diminished aortic lesion progression and reduced, below pre-existing levels, lesions in the aortic sinus of atherosclerotic mice.

To determine if this also induces long-term plastic changes on cortical maps and connectivity in the visual cortex and higher associative areas, mesoscopic calcium imaging was performed in head-fixed awake GCaMP6s adult mice before and after conditioning. The conditioned stimulus (0.03 cpd, 30°, 100% contrast,  Hz-drifting gratings) was presented 1 min daily for a week. Saline or Donepezil (DPZ, 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates cholinergic transmission, were injected prior to each conditioning session and compared to a sham-conditioned group. Cortical maps of resting state and evoked response to the monocular presentation of conditioned or non-conditioned stimulus (30°, 5 and 75% contrast; 90°, 50, 75, and 100% contrast) were established. Amplitude, duration, and latency of the peak response, as well as size of activation were measured in the primary visual cortex (V1), secondary visual areas (AL, A, AM, PM, LM, RL), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and higher cortical areas. Visual stimulation increased calcium signaling in all primary and secondary visual areas, the RSC, but no other cortices. There were no significant effects of sham-conditioning or conditioning alone, but DPZ treatment during conditioning significantly decreased the integrated neuronal activity of superficial layers evoked by the conditioned stimulus in V1, AL, PM, and LM. The activity of downstream cortical areas was not changed. The size of the activated area was decreased in V1 and PM, and the signal-to-noise ratio was decreased in AL and PM. Interestingly, signal correlation was seen only between V1, the ventral visual pathway, and the RSC, and was decreased by DPZ administration. The resting state activity was slightly correlated and rarely affected by treatments, except between binocular and monocular V1 in both hemispheres. In conclusion, cholinergic potentiation of visual conditioning induced change in visual processing in the superficial cortical layers. This effect might be a key mechanism in the establishment of the fine cortical tuning in response to the conditioned visual stimulus.",2020-07-03,Frontiers in Neural Circuits,https://openalex.org/V73252628,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2020.00038,,,,,1,2,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3039282149,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2020.00038,journal-article,3039282149

Based on this observation, we examined temporal trends and predictors of IPC use in metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving critical care therapies (CCT). We identified mPCa patients receiving CCT within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2004–2015). IPC use rates were evaluated using univariable estimated annual percentage changes analyses. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used after adjustment for clustering at hospital level. Of 416 mPCa patients receiving CCT, 44 (11.3%) received IPC. IPC use increased from 1. to 22.3% (EAPC: +19.6%, p < 0.001).

Abstract:
In the context of studies of biologically active peptides towards the design of peptidomimetics, alpha-amino-delta-lactams (Adl) have been used as conformationally constrained analogs in structure-activity relationships and biological studies [1]. For example, enhanced selectivity and oral bioavailability were achieved by replacement of the D-Phe-Pro residue by (S)-Adl-Gly in thrombin inhibitors [2]. Ring substituted Adl analogs have been pursued to mimic both backbone and side-chain geometry in peptide structures such as b-turns [3]. Our presentation will describe the synthesis of gamma-substituted Adl analogs [4].

These tics are generally more prevalent in childhood. Tics typically reach their maximum severity before puberty, around age 10 to 12. In most patients, tic severity usually decreases during late adolescence and adulthood. However, this is not true for all individuals. To date, the developmental trajectory leading to the persistence of tics into adulthood is still poorly understood. There are very few markers that can predict the evolution of tic symptoms from childhood to adulthood. Yet, while we cannot cure Tourette syndrome, it is possible to reduce tic severity with various treatments. The most common treatments are pharmacotherapy and behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, there appears to be a limit to the proportion of tics that can be treated, since most treatments offer an average reduction in tics of no more than 50%. Thus, at first, this article reviews recent advances in treatment and symptom progression. Next, we propose some lines of research to improve the management and treatment of people with Tourette syndrome.",2020-04-01,L'Encéphale,https://openalex.org/V4210168811,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2019.10.002,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3004269394,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2019.10.002,journal-article,3004269394

Given the key role of this system in adenosine triphosphate production, genes from both genomes must coevolve. A combination of northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos) or finescale dace (C. neogaeus) mitochondrial genome with a C. eos nuclear genome allows for a close examination of a naturally occurring disruption of mitonuclear coevolution. We, therefore, investigated the combined effect of mitonuclear genotypes, acclimation, and temperature on the activity of enzymes linked with the energy metabolism in a sympatric population of wild type and cybrid. As expected, the activity of the nuclear-encoded citrate synthase was only influenced by temperature while the cytochrome c oxidase (composed of nuclear and mitochondrial subunits from wild type and cybrid individuals) responded differently to temperature. This study provides clear evidence of the extent by which mitonuclear coadaptation could influence aerobic metabolism.",2020-02-29,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological and Integrative Physiology,https://openalex.org/V4210175218,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/jez.2355,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3007579135,https://doi.org/10.1002/jez.2355,journal-article,3007579135

Our objective was to describe use of other tobacco products (OTPs) and ND according to change in cigarette smoking status over four years in young adults. Methods We drew data from a longitudinal study of 129 adolescents age 12–13 at inception in 1999–2000 and followed into young adulthood. Among 79 participants with data at age 2 and 24, 22% had never smoked cigarettes; 37% were “sustained smokers”; 9% were “relapsers”; 10% had quit 1–3 years ago; and 22% had quit ≥4 years ago. We described past-year OTP (i.e., cigars/cigarillos, waterpipe, sundry tobacco products (i.e., pipe, bidis, chewing tobacco, snuff)) use and ND over 4 years in these groups. Results At age 20, sustained smokers reported using a mean(SD) of 1.1(0.9) OTP in the past-year; relapsers reported 0.5(0.6); shorter-term quitters reported 0.9(0.7); longer-term quitters reported 0.3(0.6); and never smokers reported 0.2(0.4). There was no change in OTP use or ND in never smokers and longer-term quitters. Shorter-term quitters reduced the number of OTPs by −0.5(95% confidence interval: −0.7,−0.3) on average over 4 years; sustained smokers decreased by −0.2(−0.3,−0.1). Relapsers increased by 0.6(0.4,0.7) on average. Conclusions OTP use and ND were stable in early adulthood among never smokers, sustained smokers and longer-term quitters, but fluctuated in parallel with stopping and starting to smoke. Research is needed to ascertain the underpinnings of these fluctuations and whether they help or hinder cessation.",2020-08-01,Addictive Behaviors,https://openalex.org/V186215666,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106404,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3012432245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106404,journal-article,3012432245

However, the varying impact of specific symptoms and their interactions on a person's motor repertoire is not understood. The current study investigates the possibility to predict global motor disabilities based on the patient symptomatology and medication. Methods: A cohort of 115 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (mean age = 67.0 ± 8.7 years old) participated in the study. Participants performed different tasks, including the Timed-Up & Go, eating soup and the Purdue Pegboard test. Performance on these tasks was judged using timing, number of errors committed, and count achieved. K-means method was used to cluster the overall performance and create different motor performance groups. Symptomatology was objectively assessed for each participant from a combination of wearable inertial sensors (bradykinesia, tremor, dyskinesia) and clinical assessment (rigidity, postural instability). A multinomial regression model was derived to predict the performance cluster membership based on the patients' symptomatology, socio-demographics information and medication. Results: Clustering exposed four distinct performance groups: normal behavior, slightly affected in fine motor tasks, affected only in TUG, and affected in all areas. The statistical model revealed that low to moderate level of dyskinesia increased the likelihood of being in the normal group. A rise in postural instability and rest tremor increase the chance to be affected in TUG. Finally, LEDD did not help distinguishing between groups, but the presence of Amantadine as part of the medication regimen appears to decrease the likelihood of being part of the groups affected in TUG. Conclusion: The approach allowed to demonstrate the potential of using clinical symptoms to predict the impact of Parkinson's disease on a person's mobility performance.",2020-03-24,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,https://openalex.org/V2595131146,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00189,,,,,1,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3013650717,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00189,journal-article,3013650717

Was NATO successful in institutionalizing self-restraint and cooperative security among its new members and partners? We contend that it was successful so long as threats to transatlantic security remained low. When states perceive that the threat is increasing, however, more traditional conceptions of national identity displace the cooperative security model. While a great deal of institutional learning happened through the process of NATO accession and partnership building in the past two decades, the socialization process stopped short of transforming new members’ security mindsets. Our main contribution, then, is to provide an accurate picture of NATO’s influence in terms of reshaping the transatlantic security community and to analyze the different versions of NATO that were proposed in the post-Cold War era.",2020-06-01,International Politics,https://openalex.org/V157128309,Springer Nature,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41311-020-00240-w,,,,,0,1,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3021182962,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41311-020-00240-w,journal-article,3021182962

Near infrared spectroscopy allows a continuous and non-invasive monitoring of brain tissue oxygenation, giving insight in some pathophysiological mechanisms potentially associated with SDB-related neurocognitive dysfunction. The present review summarizes the finding of studies describing brain tissue oxygenation in adults and children with SDB. Contrary to adults, mean nocturnal tissue oxygenation index (TOI) during sleep does not seem to be different in children with SDB as compared to healthy controls. During respiratory events such as apnoeas and hypopnoeas, the decrease in TOI precedes the peripheral, systemic desaturation. The decrease in TOI has been shown to be greater during apnoeas as compared to hypopnoeas, during rapid-eye movement sleep as compared to other sleep stages, in younger children as compared to their older counterparts, and in those with a high apnoea–hypopnoea index as compared with a low apnoea–hypopnoea index. Studies analyzing the association between repetitive changes in TOI and neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunction may help to decipher the pathophysiology of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with SDB in children.",2020-04-01,Paediatric Respiratory Reviews,https://openalex.org/V98953465,Elsevier,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2019.10.002,18,23,34,,1,0,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2982257776,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2019.10.002,journal-article,2982257776
